Another successful track in 1989 was \"Raat Bhar Jaam Se\" from the film Tridev, which had music by Kalyanji-Anandji and Viju Shah.

This was also the period when she got into a major controversy with the man who recorded several hit songs with her, Anu Malik. During the release of Made in India, Alisha had accused Anu Malik of molesting her.

Alisha's comeback to film music was with the song \"Oh My Darling\" in the Yash Raj Film Mujhse Dosti Karoge!. Through the 2000\u20132009 decade, she recorded primarily with Himesh Reshammiya, Shankar Ehsaan Loy and Pritam.

        "artist_name": "Anand\u2013Milind", 
        "biography": " Anand and Milind are an Indian music directors duo consisting of Anand Shrivastav and his younger brother Milind. They have composed music for over 200 Bollywood films and are the sons of 1960s music director, Chitragupta.   Anand\u2013Milind debuted in Ab Aayega Mazaa (1984) and rose to fame after the success of Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988). The film's successful songs include \"Papa Kehte Hain\",\"Ghazab Ka Hai Din\", and \"Akele Hai To Kya Gham Hai\". The music for \"Akele Hain To Kya Gum Hai\" is an exact reproduction of the instrumental number Return to the Alamo by the band The Shadows. The same year also saw the moderate success of the horror flick Woh phir Aayegi. Their collaboration with Gulshan Kumar yielded several music success's like Lal Dupatta Malmal Ka, Ayee Milan Ki Raat and Sangeet. Sangeet and Dhanwan with director K. Vishwanath, are amongst their finest works. Anand\u2013Milind mostly found loyalists in producers Nitin Manmohan and Nandu Tolani, who repeated them in almost all their projects throughout the 1990s. With Nitin Manmohan, the duo delivered hits in Maha-Sangram, Baaghi, Adharm, Bol Radha Bol, Laadla, Eena Meena Deeka, Army and Chal Mere Bhai. With Nandu Tolani, they worked on hits like Yaad Rakhegi Duniya, Swarg, Raja Babu, Mr. Bechara and Banarsi Babu. They also had a good track record with producer-director Suneel Darshan, for whom they conjured hit music in Lootere (1993) (produced by Suneel Darshan and directed by Dharmesh Darshan), Ajay (1996) and Jaanwar (1999). They also delivered hits with Vashu Bhagnani in films like Coolie No. 1 and Hero No. 1 and were regulars with producer Dr. D. Rama Naidu with hit scores in films like Rakhwala, Prem Qaidi, Santaan, Anari and Taqdeerwala. They also composed more modern songs for Rakshak: \"Shehar Ki Ladki\" and \"Sundara Sundara\". They formed a hit-team with Ashok Honda in films like Anth, Rakshak and Krodh. Anand\u2013Milind have worked with several big names in their career. These include Pankuj Parashar, Mansoor Khan, Indra kumar, David Dhawan, K Bhagrajya, K Vishwanat, Hrishikesh Mukherji, J P Dutta (shelved film called Chooriaan), Mehul Kumar, Raj Kanwar, Mukul S Anand, Dharmesh Darshan, K Murli Mohan Rao, Priyadarshan, Mohan Kumar, Harmesh Malhotra, Pramod Chakraboty, Prakash Jha, MEHUL KUMAR, Amol Palekar among others Anand\u2013Milind styled their music mostly based on Indian melodies and folk tunes. Their compositions bore some resemblance to the Laxmikant-Pyarelal school of music, in the early 1990s, resulting in most of their compositions between 1988-1995 being popular in the interiors and rural India, even today. In fact, Laxmikant-Pyarelal loyalists like Mohan Kumar, Harmesh Malhotra, K. Vishwanath, Ashok Ghai, Boney Kapoor, to name a few, opted for Anand\u2013Milind in the 1990s over Laxmikant-Pyarelal for their new projects. Later, they went on to be influenced by some tunes by maestro Illayaraja, and the beats and style from these songs formed a major part of their arrangements. So much so, that a lot of their tunes began sounding alike. This was one of the main reasons for their downfall in the late 1990s from the immense popularity they achieved during the early 1990s, giving room to new composers and their fresh compositions. As guest composers, Anand\u2013Milind made an impact with Tanhaai in Dillagi and Saawan Barse Tarse Dil in Dahek. Apart from this, they have also appeared as guest composers in films like Jaanam Samjha Karo, Chotta Chetan, and Rakht. In the south, they created the highly successful and critically acclaimed soundtrack for the Telugu film, Idi Maa Ashokgadi Love Story. Anand\u2013Milind and lyricist Sameer created more than 950 songs together. Almost every film had Sameer doing the lyrics, until their fallout (see the Controversy section for details). The other lyricists with whom Anand\u2013Milind mostly worked were Majrooh Sultanpuri and Anand Bakshi. They created Indian melodies with folkish influences for Raj Kanwar's Jaan (1996). They also created a several love ballads and the popular Shiamak Davar title track for Hrishikesh Mukherji's Jhoot Bole Kauwa Kaate. Anand Bakshi worded both these albums. Other hits with Anand Bakshi included Aazmayish, Pehla Pehla Pyaar and Chhupa Rustam: A Musical Thriller. With Majrooh Sultanpuri, they created the award winning Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Laal Dupatta Malmal Ka, Tum Mere Ho, Naam Kya Hain, Daulat Ki Jung and two songs in Dahek, Saawan Barse which turned out to be popular. They teamed up with Dev Kohli, Nitin Raikar, Santosh Anand and Deepak Chowdhary as well for many a hit songs. Anand\u2013Milind continued to write music throughout the 1990s for various directors. However of all their works, they are best remembered for their association with director David Dhawan and actor Govinda. They collaborated with David Dhawan on several hit soundtracks such as Swarg, Bol Radha Bol, Raja Babu, Eena Meena Deeka, Loafer, Coolie No.1, Hero No. 1 and Chal Mere Bhai. They also composed hits for Govinda in Maha Sangram, Swarg, Jaan Se Pyaara, Baaz, Raja Babu (film), Kismat, Coolie No. 1, Chhote Sarkar, Hero No. 1, Banarasi Babu, Dulhe Raja, Rajaji, Aunty No. 1, Akhiyon Se Goli Maare and Khullam Khulla Pyaar Karen. Anand\u2013Milind have composed some of Madhuri Dixit's popular dance numbers. I Love You (Maha-Sangram), Saal Ke Barah Mahine (Phool), Main Kunwari Hoon (Sangeet) and Chane Ke Khet Mein, Barson Ke Baad and Kolhapur Se Aayi Hoon (Anjaam) are some of the hits they composed for Madhuri Dixit. They also composed Dum dama dum Dil and the smash-hit Dhak Dhak Karne Laga Beta for Madhuri Dixit, though this was a copy of the hit Ilayaraaja song Abbani Teeyani Debba starring Sridevi. They also composed the soul stirring Raat Mehke and the melodious Kehdo Ek Baar Sajna (Mrityudand). Unlike their biggest competitor, Nadeem-Shravan (who worked with selected favorites), Anand\u2013Milind worked with and introduced a lot of playback singers. They initially recorded a few songs with Kishore Kumar. They also worked with legends Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle. Then in 90 they have worked a lot with singers Kumar Sanu, Amit Kumar & S P Balasubramanyam. It's common knowledge that Anand\u2013Milind re-introduced Udit Narayan and Abhijeet. They also heavily promoted Poornima and worked with Sapna Mukherjee on a regular basis. Alka Yagnik, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Sadhna Sargam and Anuradha Paudwal were regulars. Anand\u2013Milind also continue to work with veterans like Suresh Wadkar. They also worked with S. Janaki, Hariharan and KS Chithra. Chithra recorded her first Hindi soundtrack under the music direction of Anand\u2013Milind (Love 1991). Ghazal singers Jagjit Singh, Anup Jalota, Pankaj Udhas and Manhar Udhas have also recorded few songs with the duo. Anand\u2013Milind also teamed up on several occasions with Amit Kumar (in the early 1990s). Their combination yielded many hits. Anand\u2013Milind also worked with Vinod Rathod a lot in the 1990s, making him the voice of Govinda in hit songs for films like Raja Babu, Banarasi Babu, Hero No. 1 and Dulhe Raja, to name a few. They also recorded with Jolly Mukherjee, Alisha Chinai and Sukhwinder Singh. Sonu Nigam was a favorite in the late 1990s and they teamed up for many a hit numbers. Anand himself sang a few songs. Pop singers Sunita Rao and Shweta Shetty have also recorded for them on several occasions. The qawali-pop king Altaf Raja recorded a few hit songs (all for films starring Mithun Chakraboty) under their supervision. Sudesh Bhosle has also been behind the microphone for the duo for several films. For the more folksy tunes, their first choice was always Sapna Awasthi over Ila Arun, with whom they recorded just one song. Anand\u2013Milind also recorded a number of songs with the then child artist Aditya Narayan and also worked on many songs with Jaspinder Narula. Anand\u2013Milind also managed to get south maestro Yesudas to record a song for them in the 1997 film Daayra. They also promoted Gayatri Iyer (Gayatri Ganjawala) in films like Loafer, Insaaf, Daanveer, Muqaddar and Tum Hi To Ho. But Anand\u2013Milind also promoted a lot of new talents whose careers never took off. Sharon Prabhakar is one of them. Anand\u2013Milind also got a lot of actors behind the microphone. Aamir Khan recited a few lines for the song Papa Kehte Hain (Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak), Aditya Pancholi for Dhak Dhak (Maha Sangram), Anupam Kher joined Amit Kumar for the song Aao Ji Aao (Mera Pati Sirf Mera Hai), Neelam recited a few lines in the title song of the film Ek Ladka Ek Ladki, Sanjay Dutt and Salman Khan crooned the title track of the film Chal Mere Bhai and recently Raghubir Yadav recorded a song for the yet to be released film, Yeh Khula Aasman. Actor Aroon Bakshi also recorded many hit songs under Anand\u2013Milind's music direction, which were mostly picturised on the main hero. Some of these include Tuna Tuna (Adharm), Jhule Jhule Lal (Jai-Kishen), filmed on Akshay Kumar, Mera Mehboob (Gopi Kishen), filmed on Sunil Shetty, Tha Tha Tha filmed on Ajay Devgun (Platform) and Boi Boi (Laadla), to name a few. Actor-Director Sachin sung a song for the duo, for the shelved film directed by him, for ABCL, called Naam Kya Hain. Veteran lyricist Anand Bakshi also recorded a song for the film Jaan (for which he also worded the songs) composed by them. With changing times, Anand\u2013Milind now opt for the newer breed of singers and have done a good amount of work with KK, Sowmya Raoh, Shaan, Sunidhi Chauhan, Shreya Ghoshal, Kunal Ganjawala, June Banerjee, Monali Thakur, Rahul Seth and Richa Sharma. Anand\u2013Milind recorded a single for their first crossover film Tie The Knot in July 2013, produced by Sanjiv Kumar and directed by Shuja Paul. This Hinglish number called Don't Tie The Knot, is written by Asif Baig and rendered by Gayatri Ganjawala. Anand\u2013Milind composed the title track and the theme music for the popular detective serial Karamchand, which hit prime time Indian television, during the late 1980s. Pankaj Parashar, the director of this extremely popular television series, directed Anand\u2013Milind's music in four films, Ab Aayega Maza, Peecha Karo, Jalwa and Inteqam. Anand\u2013Milind also composed the theme track for Lehren, a film based video-magazine, which released in several volumes in the late 1980s through the early 1990s. Lehren showcased film parties, film events and also reviewed new film releases. It also covered features on forthcoming films and was hugely successful while it was produced. Anand\u2013Milind also appeared as judges in a few episodes of India's first singing, talent-based show Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, around the final season, before it joined the \"voting-by-viewers\" bandwagon to compete with Sony television's Indian Idol. Anand\u2013Milind have also composed the theme music for the period-fantasy drama Chandramukhi, directed by Sunil Agnihotri, who also directed them in films like Jai-Kishen and Ali Baba Aur 40 Chor. Anand\u2013Milind had their share of controversies. When Alka Yagnik's songs in the film Dil were dubbed by Anuradha Paudwal, Alka Yagnik did not work with the duo for almost 2\u00a0years, only to patch up in 1993 and record close to 200 songs. Kavita Krishnamurthy and Anand\u2013Milind have never worked together post 1996. The reason for this was Kavita Krishnamurthy's decision to not accompany Anand\u2013Milind on a musical tour. Neither have confirmed this though. They copied tunes by south maestro Illayaraja's compositions in several of their films like Love, Dil, Beta, Anari, Taqdeerwala etc. on the insistence of the directors and producers of these films. Anand\u2013Milind were replaced in two projects. In Jaanam Samjha Karo, Anu Malik replaced them, though one song composed by them was retained (which was sung by Alka Yagnik) and in Dahek, Aadesh Shrivastava replaced them, with two of their songs being retained. They expressed their displeasure to this practice, but the producers insisted on multiple composers. Anand Raj Anand was brought in as a guest composer in two other films composed by Anand\u2013Milind, Ankhiyon Se Goli Maare (also featuring songs by Daboo Malik and Dilip Sen-Sameer Sen) and Jaani Dushman - Ek Anokhi Prem Kahani (which also had one song by Sandeep Chowta). Ironically, despite their protests, Anand\u2013Milind themselves appeared as guest composers in two films, Rakht, which had Anand Raj Anand, Shaan and Naresh Sharma sharing credits and the re-released version of Chota Chetan, which had music by Illayaraja, Laxmikant-Pyarelal and Anu Malik, along with Anand\u2013Milind. After having worked on almost 950 songs, Anand\u2013Milind and Sameer parted ways in 2000 (after Chal Mere Bhai) and a delayed 2004 release of Police Force when Anand\u2013Milind felt that Sameer wasn't giving their films the attention it deserved. During this gap, Anand\u2013Milind worked with lyricists like Ibrahim Ashq, Salim Binjori, Praveen Baharadwaj and Jalees Sherwani. The cold war thawed at Sameer's book release function where the lyricist reminisced about his association with Anand\u2013Milind. \"At the event, Sameer mentioned that he had written 950 songs with us and only around 400 with Nadeem-Shravan. I immediately messaged him saying let's add another 50 and make it a thousand; it will be a record. He agreed promptly,\" says Milind. They re-united with a Bhojpuri film called Sajan Sangh Laagi Laganiya Re and Idiot Box (2010). Legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar, who worked with Anand\u2013Milind's father Chitragupta, gave Milind his name. Anand\u2013Milind created a record of sorts by completing 100 films in 1994, most of which were composed between 1990-1994. Anand\u2013Milind were signed to do the music of Pahlaj Nihlani's ambitious project Indian which was all set to star Sunny Deol and Aishwariya Rai. They even composed a few tunes but the film was shelved. Sunny Deol however, was very impressed by one song Tanhaai sung by none other than Pakistani qawali maestro Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and decided to use the song from Indian in his maiden directorial venture Dillagi. Dhak Dhak Karne Laga (Beta (film)), composed by the duo, was incorporated in the Rohan Sippy directed film Nautanki Saala(2013). The song was rearranged by Mikey McCleary and sung by Saba Azad, Geet Sagar, Bruno Carvalo, Santosh Sawant as opposed to the original singers Udit Narayan and Anuradha Paudwal, the latter who won the Filmfare award for the best female playback singer for this song in 1993. Another Madhuri Dixit hit dance number, I Love You from Mahasangram was included in Ram Gopal Varma's Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon. Anand\u2013Milind worked with ace director J. P.

        "artist_name": "Anuradha_Paudwal", 
        "biography": " Anuradha Paudwal (born 27 October 1952) is an Indian playback singer in Bollywood. Anuradha Paudwal honored with honorary degree of D.Lit., the second singer who receives this degree after the legendary Lata Mangeshkar. In 2017, the Government of India awarded her Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour, in recognition of her achievements.She is a four-time winner from 15 nominations of the Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer,a recipient of the National Film Award. She has sung 8996 songs in Hindi only and some songs of other languages including her marathi songs. she is also very popular in devotional songs. Kavita Paudwal is her daughter, she is also a popular bhajan as well as a bollywood singer. Kavita took training from her mother, Anuradha Paudwal with Suresh Wadkar. Anuradha Paudwal is also best known for crooning devotional songs (bhajans) and is a known face in Devotional field. She has sung numerous bhajans in hindi and many other languages. She has sung many bhajans. Some of her albums are Aaja Maa, Durga Amritwani, Mahakali Amritwani, Shri Saraswati Chalisa, Jai Triveni Sangam Har Har, Mahamrutunjya Mantra Jaap Mala, Gayatri Mantra, Durga Saptshati, Navdurga Vandana, Mahakali Chalisa, Jai Kali Kali Kali and many more. She has sung more than 1,500 bhajans. She has an foundation named Suryauday. Most of the bhajans by her were released under the label T-Series. She has sung in several languages including Hindi, Kannada, Rajasthani, Pahari, Marathi, Sanskrit, Bengali, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Oriya, Assamese, Punjabi, Bhojpuri, Nepali and Maithili.[citation needed]   Anuradha was born in Karwar, Uttara Kannada, Karnataka as ' Alka Nadakarni ' in a Konkani family and was brought up in Mumbai. Her singing career started in 1973 with the movie, Abhimaan, (starring Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan) in which she sang a Shloka (a Sanskrit verse). In the same year she also made her Marathi film debut with \"Yashoda\" (music by Datta Davjekar). In 1974, she brought out a record of Non-film Marathi songs or \"bhav geeten\" which became very popular.[citation needed] She also came into focus when she challenged Lata Mangeshkar's claim to having recorded the maximum number of songs in a single day. She also accused the Mangeshkar sisters for indulging in monopoly. This outspoken nature at times landed her in trouble as the music directors of the industry feared to face the wrath of Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhonsle and they often avoided Anuradha Paudwal.Many a times Anuradha's songs were dubbed by Lata such as Main Teri Dushman (Nagina) and many such songs. Paudwal continued to conquer new horizons and winning accolades (Anuradha has won three Filmfare awards in a row for Aashiqui, Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahin and Beta). She was on the verge of being the next Lata Mangeshkar. Even the legendary composer O P Nayyar commented, \"Lata is finished, Anuradha has replaced her.\" During this period, everything seemed to be working for the singer who left her contemporaries far behind. Kavita Krishnamurthy has always stated that, \"Among my counterparts (Alka Yagnik, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Sadhana Sargam, etc.) Anuradha is the best singer.\"[citation needed] At her peak Anuradha Paudwal announced that she would exclusively sing for T-Series only. This stand benefited Alka Yagnik who just zoomed to the top with her newfound association with Nadeem-Shravan and Anu Malik, who had stopped composing for Gulshan Kumar due to some differences. As she stopped singing songs for films and concentrated more on devotional and cover-version albums, she harmed her immensely successful career. For almost five years, Anuradha Paudwal did not sing for many films and for any other music company.[citation needed] In 1976, she got her break as a playback singer in Hindi films with Kalicharan (starring Shatrughan Sinha and Reena Roy). Her first solo was in the movie, Aap Beati, (starring Hema Malini and Shashi Kapoor). Laxmikant-Pyarelal were the music-composer duo for that movie. She also occasionally sang songs for composers Rajesh Roshan (Udhar Ka Sindoor), Jaidev (Dooriyan, Laila Majnu), Kalyanji Anandji (Kalaakar, Vidhaata), and Usha Khanna (Souten, Saajan Bina Suhagan).[citation needed] Anuradha apparently never received any formal training in classical music, stating in an interview, \"I have not received any formal training in classical music. I have tried many times, but it has never worked out. I learnt a little here and a little there, but ultimately, I just practiced for many hours listening to Lataji\". Anuradha gained recognition with her popular numbers for the movie, Hero, for composers Laxmikant-Pyarelal. Her collaboration with Laxmikant-Pyarelal produced more success with songs for Meri Jung (\"O Mere Kwabon Ke\"), Batwara (\"Thaare Vaaste Re Dola-Tu Maaro Kaun Lage\"), Nagina and many more. Ram Lakhan saw Laxmikant-Pyarelal giving three major hit songs to Anuradha. Their association ended with Tezaab where she sang two good numbers for them \u2013 \"Kehdo Ki Tum\" and \"Hum Tumko Dilbar Kyon Maane\". Following this she collaborated with movie producer, Gulshan Kumar, and began a success streak with the movies, Lal Dupatta Malmal Ka, Tezaab, Aashiqui and Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin. She along with Gulshan Kumar were instrumental in getting many unknown playback singers to the fore, including Kumar Sanu, Udit Narayan, Abhijeet, Sonu Nigam. New Music directors, including her husband Arun Paudwal, were introduced to the music world. Nadeem-Shravan, Anu Malik, Anand-Milind, Nikhil Vinay and Amar Utpal all collaborated with T-Series (Gulshan Kumar's music label) and started a new era of melody in Bollywood.

Her other notable songs were also for the famous duo Shiv-Hari, for the movie \"Sahebaan\". She has also sung for R.D. Burman in her initial days and actually convinced him to make songs for Gulshan Kumar's label in his last days and the song \"Aja Meri Jaan\" set to one of the background score of R.D.Burman from Saagar is still popular.

Most of these movies had music by the duo of Anil-Arun, Arun being her husband, who collaborated with Anil Mohile to form a pair.

In an Interview given to Mid-day in the December 2016, Arijit said \"Independent Music in India needs to be redefined\" and he is working on some \"Independent Music Projects\" but he believes that Bollywood Music Overpowers Independent Music, and there is lack of infrastructure and platform for the Independent Music in India, and it is difficult to produce Independent(Non-Film) Music in India In an interview with The Times of India, Singh mentioned that he has a \"natural voice\" and when his voice breaks, it recovers automatically; \"I don't do anything special to maintain my voice\". Shekhar Ravjiani from the music director duo Vishal\u2013Shekhar wrote that Singh's \"vocal texture is brilliant. The way he emotes and the soul he puts into each song is exemplary\".Vishal Dadlani from the music director duo Vishal-Shekhar said Arijit Singh is a phenomenal singer,one can see that in any songs which he sings.India Today identifies his voice as \"raw and grainy\", while International Business Times consider his voice \"soothing\". Koimoi, in a review, remarked: \"Arijit has the quality of getting into the zone and the mood of the song which he sings. Be it a romantic, sad or a peppy number, he voices his best to any\". Singh describes his voice as \"nasal\" and he believed that his voice matches with all the actors. Bollywood Hungama, in a review of Aashiqui 2, described Singh as a singer with a \"rich texture and depth in his voice\". However they advised Singh to \"sing smoothly\", without heavy breaths in between. In an interview, Singh mentioned that he would like to explore classical music style the most. He also stated that he loves singing folk music, and likes all genres except for heavy metal music\u2014since it is too loud for him. Singh is most common known for his romantic songs and was associated with the tag \"romantic singer\". Regarding that,Singh said the 'tag' of romantic singer is unintentional,as he haven't planned his carrier, he is happy with the songs that comes in his way and tries to do level best. Singh believed that he does not care about the fact that doing just one type of song is \"hampering\" his growth. However, through his career, he explores different musical style, including; a club party song \"Raat Bhar\", an electronic \"Blame The Night\", a Punjabi Folk \"Samjhawan\", a Sufi or Qawwali song \"Mast Magan\" and a ghazal titled \"Gulon Mein Rang Bhare\". Regarding the variety, Hindustan Times stated; \"Singh is very versatile as a singer and has a great cinematic voice, One can fall in love with his romantic voice. Plus, he can sing nice fun songs as well\". According to Krsna, in today's times, \"A vocalist needs to have all genres of music at his fingertips and Arijit has that\". While reviewing the soundtrack of Main Tera Hero, Bollywood Hungama perceived that he \"shines\" in the form, which is a \"totally different setup\" from what we have heard him in before. Reviewing the emotional song \"Chunar\" dedicated to mother from \"Any Body Can Dance 2\" Movie, Komoi wrote Singh\u2019s voice truly converse the pain and the Indian musical arrangements work their magic along with the emotionally rich lyrics. The song finds an instant connect with the listener and in moments of solace this one would be a gem to listen to. Singh's \"mispronunciation\" of the phonetic 'ta' syllable was criticised by India West, while reviewing the song \"Chunar\". Similarly, Bollywood Hungama considered his pronunciation \"flawed\" in the title track of Khamoshiyan. However the Producer of the film Khamoshiyan, Mahesh Bhatt said It is a sensational song. One of the best songs that I have heard in my lifetime and its poetry is simply brilliant. Very few songs will ever match the intensity of the Khamoshiyan song and we have used it in the trailer. While reviewing the rest of his tracks in the film, The Indian Express, felt that Singh's rendition in the song sounds as \"he's on autopilot\", though Rajiv Vijayakar from Bollywood Hungama felt his rendition is \"emotional\". While Reviewing the song \"Soch Na Sake\" with the music composed by Amaal Mallik from the movie Airlift Bollywood hungama wrote \" Love songs and Arijit goes hand by hand , the song is like honey to the ears and the Punjabi lyrics are heart-wrenching. Arijit Insists the presence of lyricists in recording Sessions for better understanding the relevance of the words and feelings behind it. Arijit remarked his favourite lyricists to be Irshad Kamil, Sayeed Quadri and Amitabh Bhattacharya. While Interacting with Subhash Ghai at a Question and answers session in Whistling Woods International Campus on Arts and technique of singing at the 5th Veda Cultural Hub, Arijit said \"Singing is like talking. It is an art of expression. There are other factors too but they all follow on once you understand your lyrics and rhythm well. There are no rules. You just have to practice well.\" Sharing his childhood memories he said, \"I mostly practiced modern Bengali and Indian classical music. My Guru Rajendra Prasad Hazari inspired me to practice more of modern singing as according to him Indian classical was dying.\" Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt Spoked about Arijit to Forbes in 2014 ,He said- Arijit is an expression of the 21st century. The youth sighs at his voice,\u201d.\u201cHis next song for us is the title track of Khamoshiyaan. When Alia Bhatt my daughter heard the song, she said it took her breath away. These emotions demonstrate the singer\u2019s contemporariness. He will be a major creative force to reckon with in the years to come. Prominent Music Director Indradeep Dasgupta said about Arijit - Arijit haven't changed even after being the toast of the nation, he still prefers the streetside tea. Bollywood Hungama wrote about Arijit in the end of 2016: \"With Arijit we can say all what this singer touches turns Gold\". \"Arijit Singh has once again made us wonder how this singer can do justice with his each and every song. Arijit who was once a reality show contestant who had failed to emerge a winner then, but now he literally owns the music industry. Every music composer wants to works with him and every director wishes to have at least one Arijit number in their movie. And we totally understand this need now. The singer literally mesmerizes everyone when he take the mic and lends his soothing voice to a track. He has nailed all and that is the reason why all his tracks rank at the top of the music charts. Arijit Singh was one of the 3 Indian Artists, The other being Armaan Malik, Kapil Sharma who were featured in the top 10 at The SSE Arena, Wembley in the SSE Live Awards 2016. Arijit Singh has played a great role in the Bollywood Singing career of one of his contemporaries today Ash King. Regarding Arijit's help Ash king told to Times of India, \"When I met Arijit in London through a mutual friend, he wasn't a star singer yet. I knew he'd be big some day. When I came back (to Kolkata) in 2010, Arijit invited me to Mumbai and recommended me to Pritam for the song I Love You and Te Amo. He has been a great motivating force.\" Media agencies wrote about Arijit - \"Ask the shy singer about his dream project and his smile broadens. The man who has taken the industry by storm is a humble being and so are his dreams. Blessed with the most mesmerizing voice of the decade, Arijit would love to serve people through his NGO - Let There Be Light which works for the Below Poverty Line (BPL) community. Further he said, I want to build up that NGO. I have thought of 3-4 songs for that project. I will make a video and a documentary film too for it. Generally NGOs have got a bad reputation, because people think its meant to siphon off money. I want to get out of that zone. The NGO aims to comprise activities like bloodbank camp (with proof and records and photographs of all the blood being delivered properly), distribution of clothes, books, stationary, etc to bpl children on a huge scale and seasonal human ground activities. In an Interview he spoked about his desire to work for people - \"I try and help people in whichever way I can. I owned an NGO long time ago which is now turned into something which helps the people in whichever way they can. For example we collected a lot of things for victims of the Nepal earthquake. The biggest problem is that we are not ready for anything bad that happens, be it during disasters or helping people post one. For example the first earthquake in Nepal happened on 25 April and it took me a while to collect something as basic as matchboxes, candles and so on. People basically are not ready to help others. I firmly feel that we over here need a lot of awareness when it comes to population and at times I even feel bad for the Government.\" During the early 2013, Singh appeared sporting a \"long-haired and bearded look\". He reasoned that he did not get time to \"cut his hair or shave\" when he is in Mumbai. In an interview with The Times of India, Singh described himself as \"horrible looking\" and that he does not \"care about it\". I haven't cared about my image till date and I don't want to do anything about it. If you are doing shows you have to look good, not jazzy. It's just that I want to look as fresh as I can. I like jeans and shirts. I want to look like a musician more than a pop star. Singh felt that his passion for singing is the biggest influence in the music career; \"It's not like that I was influenced by anyone to enter the industry. I always dreamt of becoming a singer\". Though he is being inspired by many artists, Singh named KK as his favorite singer along with Ayushmann Khurrana. He named Pritam Chakraborty, Vishal\u2013Shekhar, Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy, Amit Trivedi, Mithoon and A. R. Rahman as his favorite music directors. Singh has idolized Ghulam Ali, Jagjit Singh and Mehdi Hassan. He stated that they are the ones who actually inspired him to sing ghazals and semi-classical songs. He also had shared his fondness for Kishore Kumar and Mohit Chauhan, for whom he is often compared to; \"Chauhan is a great singer, a great musician and a big icon in India. Being compared to him makes me tremendously happy\". In an interview to \"Filmbeat\" in the April of 2013 he declared that he is the biggest fan of Singer Krishna Kumar Kunnath (KK),he further said \"KK\" has great voice.

Arijit hails from a family of music lovers from Murshidabad with his mother Aditi Singh and grandmother Bharti Devi both being trained singers. He started training under the Harjari brothers at the age of three. He was trained in Indian classical music by Guru Rajendra Prasad Harjari, Guru Dhirendra Prasad Harjari taught him tabla and Guru Virendra Prasad Harjari taught him Rabindra sangeet, a bit of pop and folk music. In an Interview he said- \u201cWhen I was four I sang a bhajan on stage. It was my first performance and that was when I realised I could sing. I was nervous but I sang well and was appreciated.\u201d In school, i sang famous songs of renowned Bengali singers like Hemant Kumar and Shyamal Mitra and recite Gurbaani too. At the age of nine, i got a scholarship from the Indian government in Indian classical music (vocals). \u201cThis gave me confidence that the path that I had chosen was right. I started singing Hindi film songs at the age of 17 and tried out other genres too.\u201d 'In an Interview in 2014 Arijit revealed that his dream always had been to sing like his idol Ustad Rashid Ali Khan. He says he owes all his skills to his guru. \u201cI used to spend seven to eight hours practising with Guru Rajendra Prasad Harjariji. He\u2019d experiment on me. I was like a guinea pig. I lost my voice almost 50 times because he would test my voice so much. But I\u2019d do it wholeheartedly.\u201d Then one fine day, his guru asked him to break free. \u201cGuruji said if need be unlearn whatever I have taught you but get out of this city. I couldn\u2019t understand what he meant. But like an obedient disciple I did what he asked me to. That\u2019s when Fame Gurukul (2005), the reality singing show, came my way . \u201cGuruji had mixed emotions. He was happy that I was getting good opportunities but at the same time he was sad that there would be a distance between us now. I was three when I had joined him. During his last days he felt hopeless since I was no longer in his class. He passed away two years ago at the age of 77.\u201d ,Arijit insists he\u2019s still learning from his late guru in teared eyes. \u201cWe have our little conversations. He still teaches me stuff. Back then there were so many things he\u2019d tell me, which I couldn\u2019t understand. But now I can connect with them\". It is to be noted that he said fond words on his guru like a tribute. According to Singh, apart from being a singer he is a badminton player, a writer, a movie freak and a documentary maker. He also likes cricket, football and his favourite sportmens are Sachin Tendulkar, Lance Klusener and Jonty Rhodes.He is an ardent football fan ,his favourite teams are Brazil and Argentina and favourite footballers are Lionel Messi, Thomas Muller.

Regarding the Forbes 2014 report, Arijit told the Information given by Forbes 2014 Celebrities 100 list seemed little weird, i would like to clarify it's a fake one. Arijit enjoys listening to retro songs by Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammed Rafi.and the classical and ghazal songs alongwith the music of coldplay. He expressed his desire to work with artist Norah Jones someday as he loves her music. On being asked, How he manages to keep himself low profile despite the fame and popularity he has ,he said- I come from a village, and to me this is something that I am not used to. I am a very simple man and I am not very comfortable with the limelight. I cannot really give interviews because showing my face everywhere is not me. In a concert at Emaar Boulder Hills, he stated; \"If I want to eat fish, I want to be free to go and buy it myself in the market. I don't like these interviews and photos\". On the personal front, he rediscovered harmony When he married his childhood friend Koel Roy in the early 2014, but is fiercely guarded about the relationship. In an Interview to Zoom4India he said- \u201cWe got married a long time ago. But we\u2019ve made it official now with a ceremony. I had a lot of complications in my life. I was going through a separation I\u2019ve gone through much. I don\u2019t want to go through it again. So let\u2019s not talk about it. Accordingly, it was his second marriage since he was reportedly, previously married to one of his co-contestants from a reality show. Roy was also previously married and has a four-year-old daughter, when they got married. In August 2015, Singh claimed that he received an extortion call from gangster Ravi Pujari, who demanded to give \u20b95 crore (US$770,000). Ravi Pujari, complimented Arijit for having a \"Good voice\" and asked whether he is interested to do business with him, as per police, Ravi Pujari called Arijit on behalf of an organiser who wanted to do show with Arijit at lower rate,he asked Arijit to do some shows for free or either pay 5 crore rupees. and it came to know that Ravi Pujari didnt threatened him,although Arijit got feared.

In an interview given to Hindustan Times in the December 2016, Arijit said I have always aspired to become a Musician and singer, I had gone through lot of hardwork,but i am satisfied,the little share that I have got is because of hardwork I had always liked living my life in a quiet and peaceful manner,the more i will give interviews the more my fans would understand this fact. But with the rise of social media it too had become difficult,Now I am always noticed and people try to reach out to me which is a different feeling,overall the change is positive. All of my fans are very supportive,which is very helpful for a singer.He remarked Papon, Shalmali Kholgade, Shefali Alvares, and almost all of his contemporaries as his favourite During Arijit's initial carrier beginnings Senior Singer KK said in an interview to GulfNews -I had known Arijit since his days at \"Fame Gurukul\" where he was one of the contestants, I always felt he was sharp and focused guy, I am very happy to see him where he is today. Indian singer Armaan Malik wrote a heartfelt letter to his contemporary idol Arijit Singh on the occasion of his 30th Birthday on Facebook - You made us all first shocked .. because we were NOT READY for you or for the talent you possessed. When I first heard \"Tum Hi Ho\" play on YouTube, I understood this is something which is not earthly, it's heavenly. With your newer songs you showed your different colours.. but along with that we also realised that you had already sung songs like \"Raabta\" & \"Phir Mohabbat\" before Aashiqui 2 had even happened.

        "biography": " Allah-Rakha Rahman (\u00a0pronunciation\u00a0(help\u00b7info), born A. S. Dileep Kumar), is an Indian composer, singer-songwriter, music producer, musician and philanthropist. A. R. Rahman's works are noted for integrating Indian classical music with electronic music, world music and traditional orchestral arrangements. Among his awards are two Academy Awards, two Grammy Awards, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe, four National Film Awards, fifteen Filmfare Awards and fifteen Filmfare Awards South. He has been awarded the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian award, in 2010 by the Government of India. In 2009, Rahman was included on the Time 100 list of the world's most influential people. The UK-based world-music magazine Songlines named him one of \"Tomorrow's World Music Icons\" in August 2011. With an in-house studio (Panchathan Record Inn in Chennai), Rahman's film-scoring career began during the early 1990s with the Tamil film Roja. Working in India's film industries, international cinema and theatre, Rahman is one of the world's all-time best-selling recording artists. In a notable two-decade career, he has been acclaimed for redefining contemporary Indian film music and contributing to the success of several films. Rahman has become a notable humanitarian and philanthropist, donating and raising money for a number of causes and charities. Rahman's body of work for film and stage has given him the nickname of \"the Mozart of Madras\", and Tamil commentators and fans call him Isai Puyal (English: the Musical Storm).   Rahman was born in Madras, India. His father, R. K. Shekhar, was a film-score composer and conductor for Tamil and Malayalam films; Rahman assisted his father in the studio, playing the keyboard. After his father's death when Rahman was nine years old, the rental of his father's musical equipment provided his family's income. Raised by his mother, Kareema (born Kashturi), Rahman was a keyboard player and arranger for bands such as Roots (with childhood friend and percussionist Sivamani, John Anthony, Suresh Peters, JoJo and Raja) and founded the Chennai-based rock group Nemesis Avenue. He mastered the keyboard, piano, synthesizer, harmonium and guitar, and was particularly interested in the synthesizer because it was the \"ideal combination of music and technology\". Rahman began his early musical training under Master Dhanraj, and at age 11 began playing in the orchestra of Malayalam composer (and close friend of his father) M. K. Arjunan. He soon began working with other composers, such as M. S. Viswanathan, Ilaiyaraaja, Ramesh Naidu and Raj-Koti, accompanied Zakir Hussain, Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan and L. Shankar on world tours and obtained a scholarship from Trinity College London to the Trinity College of Music. Studying in Madras, Rahman graduated with a diploma in Western classical music from the school. Rahman was introduced to Qadiri Islam when his younger sister was seriously ill in 1984. His mother was a practicing Hindu. He converted to Islam with other members of his family in 1989 at age 23, changing his name from R. S. Dileep Kumar to Allah Rakha Rahman (A. R. Rahman). Rahman initially composed scores for documentaries and jingles for advertisements and Indian television channels. In 1987 Rahman, then still known as Dileep, composed jingles for a line of watches introduced by Allwyn. He also arranged the jingles for some advertisements that went on to become very popular, including the popular jingle for Titan Watches, in which he used the theme from Mozart's Symphony no.25. In 1992, he was approached by director Mani Ratnam to compose the score and soundtrack for his Tamil film, Roja. Rahman's film career began in 1992 when he started Panchathan Record Inn, a recording and mixing studio in his backyard. It would become the most-advanced recording studio in India, and arguably one of Asia's most sophisticated and high-tech studios. Cinematographer Santosh Sivan signed Rahman for the Malayalam film Yodha, a Mohanlal starrer directed by Sivan's brother Sangeeth Sivan that released in September 1992. The following year, Rahman received the Rajat Kamal (Silver Lotus) award for best music director at the National Film Awards for Roja. The films' score was critically and commercially successful in its original and dubbed versions, led by the innovative theme \"Chinna Chinna Aasai\". Rahman followed this with successful scores and songs for Tamil\u2013language films for the Chennai film industry, including Ratnam's politically-charged Bombay, the urban Kadhalan, Thiruda Thiruda and S. Shankar's debut film Gentleman (with its popular dance song, \"Chikku Bukku Rayile\"). Rahman collaborated with director Bharathiraaja on Kizhakku Cheemayile and Karuththamma, producing successful Tamil rural folk-inspired film songs; he also composed for K. Balachander's Duet, which had some memorable Saxophone themes. The 1995 film Indira and romantic comedies Mr. Romeo and Love Birds also drew attention. Rahman attracted a Japanese audience with Muthu's success there. His soundtracks are known in the Tamil Nadu film industry and abroad for his versatility in combining Western classical music, Carnatic and Tamil traditional and folk-music traditions, jazz, reggae and rock music. The soundtrack for Bombay sold 12\u00a0million copies worldwide, and \"Bombay Theme\" would later reappear in his soundtrack for Deepa Mehta's Fire and a number of compilations and other media. It was featured in the 2002 Palestinian film Divine Intervention and the 2005 Nicolas Cage film, Lord of War. Rangeela, directed by Ram Gopal Varma, was Rahman's Bollywood debut. Successful scores and songs for Dil Se.. and the percussive Taal followed. Sufi mysticism inspired \"Chaiyya Chaiyya\" from the former film and \"Zikr\" from his soundtrack album for Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero (which featured elaborate orchestral and choral arrangements). Rahman's soundtrack album for the Chennai production Minsaara Kanavu won him his second National Film Award for Best Music Direction and a South FilmFare Award for Best Music Direction in a Tamil film in 1997, the latter setting a record of six consecutive wins; he later went on to win the award three consecutive additional times. The musical cues in the soundtrack albums for Sangamam and Iruvar used Carnatic vocals, the veena, rock guitar and jazz. During the 2000s, Rahman composed scores and popular songs for Rajiv Menon's Kandukondain Kandukondain, Alaipayuthey, Ashutosh Gowariker's Swades, Rang De Basanti and songs with Hindustani motifs for 2005's Water. Rahman has worked with Indian poets and lyricists such as Javed Akhtar, Gulzar, Vairamuthu and Vaali, and has produced commercially successful soundtracks with directors Mani Ratnam and S. Shankar (Gentleman, Kadhalan, Indian, Jeans, Mudhalvan, Nayak, Boys, Sivaji and Enthiran). In 2005 Rahman expanded his Panchathan Record Inn studio by establishing AM Studios in Kodambakkam, Chennai, creating the most cutting-edge studio in Asia. The following year he launched his own music label, KM Music, with his score for Sillunu Oru Kaadhal. Rahman scored the Mandarin-language film Warriors of Heaven and Earth in 2003 after researching and using Chinese and Japanese classical music, and won the Just Plain Folks Music Award For Best Music Album for his score for 2006's Varalaru (God Father). He co-scored Shekhar Kapur's first British film, Elizabeth: The Golden Age, in 2007 and received a Best Composer Asian Film Award nomination at the Hong Kong International Film Festival for his Jodhaa Akbar score. Rahman's music has been sampled for other scores in India, appearing in Inside Man, Lord of War, Divine Intervention and The Accidental Husband. His score for his first Hollywood film, the 2009 comedy Couples Retreat, won the BMI London Award for Best Score. Rahman's music for 2008's Slumdog Millionaire won a Golden Globe and two Academy Awards (a first for an Asian), and the songs \"Jai Ho\" and \"O... Saya\" from its soundtrack were internationally successful. His music on 2008's Bollywood Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na was popular with Indian youth; that year, his score and songs for Jodhaa Akbar won critical acclaim, a Best Composer Asian Film Award nomination and IIFA awards for best music direction and score. In 2010, Rahman composed the original score and songs for the romantic Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, the sci-fi romance Enthiran and Danny Boyle's 127 Hours, composing for the Imtiaz Ali musical Rockstar; the latter's soundtrack was a critical and commercial success. In 2012 Rahman composed for Ekk Deewana Tha and the American drama People Like Us, and collaborated with director Yash Chopra on Jab Tak Hai Jaan. all were positively received. By the end of the year his music for Mani Ratnam's Kadal was critically acclaimed, and the album topped the iTunes India chart for December. In 2013, Rahman had two releases: Raanjhanaa and Maryan. Both were successful, with the former nominated for a number of awards and the latter the iTunes India Tamil Album of 2013. The year 2014 was one of the busiest years for Rahman, with him claiming to have worked in 12 films in various languages. While his first release for the year was the Imtiaz Ali's road movie Highway which garnered positive reviews, his very next release was the performance captured animation film Kochadaiiyaan, a Rajinikanth starrer directed by Soundarya Rajinikanth. The film's score and soundtrack garnered huge critical appraise with its score being long-listed at the forthcoming Academy Awards. His next were the scores for the two back to back Hollywood films, Million Dollar Arm and The Hundred Foot Journey, both of which got into the contended list for the original score category nomination at the Oscars. This was followed by the highly successful soundtrack album for the period drama Kaaviya Thalaivan teaming up with director Vasanthabalan for the first time. His next release was Shankar's supernatural thriller I and K. S. Ravikumar's period action film Lingaa, both of which were highly acclaimed and appreciated upon release. Apart from successful soundtracks, he is also known for highly acclaimed background scores and is considered, one of the finest background-score composers in India. His background scores are often characterised by the usage of subtle orchestration and ambient sounds. Trained in western classical music, he often employs contemporary instruments such as Guitars, Cello, Flute, Strings, Keyboard, Finger board, Harpejji, Santoor and traditional Indian instruments such as Shehnai, Sitar, Mrudangam, Veenai & Tabla to create scores. Apart from getting high critical appreciations, several of Rahman's background scores have earned him many prestigious awards ranging from Academy awards to Filmfare awards. Some of the films which fetched him appreciations for background scores include Roja, Bombay, Iruvar, Minsara Kanavu, Dil Se.., Taal, Lagaan, The Legend of Bhagat Singh, Swades, Rang De Basanti, Bose: The Forgotten Hero, Guru, Jodhaa Akbar, Raavanan, Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, Rockstar, Enthiran ,Kadal , Kochadaiiyaan and I. Among his Hollywood scores, Warriors of Heaven and Earth, Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours, Million Dollar Arm and The Hundred-Foot Journey received rave reviews. A. R. Rahman received two Academy Awards for Slumdog Millionaire and two Academy Award nominations for 127 Hours. Recently, his scores for Kochadaiiyaan, Million Dollar Arm and The Hundred-Foot Journey have been nominated in the long list released by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Rahman has also been involved in non-film projects. Vande Mataram, an album of original compositions released for India's 50th anniversary of its independence in 1997, is one of India's bestselling non-film albums. He followed it with an album for the Bharat Bala\u2013directed video Jana Gana Mana, a collection of performances by leading exponents and artists of Indian classical music. Rahman has written advertising jingles and orchestrations for athletic events, television and Internet media, documentaries and short films, frequently using the Czech Film Orchestra and the Chennai Strings Orchestra. In 1999, Rahman partnered with choreographers Shobana and Prabhu Deva and a Tamil film-dancing troupe to perform with Michael Jackson in Munich, Germany at his Michael Jackson and Friends concert. In 2002 he composed the music for his first stage production, Bombay Dreams, which was commissioned by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The Finnish folk-music band V\u00e4rttin\u00e4 collaborated with Rahman on the Toronto production of The Lord of the Rings, and in 2004 he composed \"Raga's Dance\" for Vanessa-Mae's album Choreography (performed by Mae and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra). Since 2004 Rahman has performed three successful world tours before audiences in Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, Dubai, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and India, and has been collaborating with Karen David on her upcoming studio album. A two-disc CD, Introducing A. R. Rahman (featuring 25 of his Tamil film-score pieces), was released in May 2006 and his non-film album Connections was released on 12 December 2008. Rahman performed at a White House state dinner arranged by US President Barack Obama during an official visit by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 24 November 2009. He is one of over 70 artists on \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti\", a charity single to raise relief funds in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In 2010, Rahman composed \"Jai Jai Garvi Gujarat\" in honour of the 50th anniversary of the formation of Gujarat State, \"Semmozhiyaana Thamizh Mozhiyaam\" as part of the World Classical Tamil Conference 2010, and the theme song for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, \"Jiyo Utho Bado Jeeto\". Rahman began his first world tour, (A. R. Rahman Jai Ho Concert: The Journey Home World Tour) on 11 June 2010 at Nassau Coliseum in New York; 16 cities worldwide were scheduled. Some of Rahman's notable compositions were performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra in April 2010. In February 2011 Rahman collaborated with Michael Bolton on Bolton's album, Gems \u2013 The Duets Collection, reworking his \"Sajna\" from Couples Retreat. On 20 May 2011 Mick Jagger announced the formation of a supergroup, SuperHeavy, with Dave Stewart, Joss Stone, Damian Marley and Rahman; its self-titled album was scheduled for release in September 2011. The album would have Jagger singing on Rahman's composition, \"Satyameva Jayate\" (\"The Truth Alone Triumphs\"). In January 2012 the Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg announced that it would join KM Music Conservatory musicians for a 100-member concert tour of five Indian cities (Germany and India 2011\u20132012: Infinite Opportunities), performing Rahman's songs. The marked the centennial of Indian cinema and Babelsberg Studio, the world's oldest film studio. In Summer 2012 Rahman composed a Punjabi song for the London Olympics opening ceremony, directed by Danny Boyle, part of a medley showcasing Indian influence in the UK. Indian musician Ilaiyaraja's song from the 1981 Tamil-language film Ram Lakshman was also chosen for the medley. In December 2012 Rahman and Shekhar Kapoor launched Qyuki, a networking site which is a platform for story writers to exchange their thoughts. Cisco invested \u20b9270\u00a0million in the startup, giving it a 17-percent share. Qyuki uses Cisco's cloud infrastructure for the site. On 20 December he released the single \"Infinite Love\" in English and Hindi, commemorating the last day of the Mayan calendar to spread hope, peace and love. Rahman's 2013 tour, Rahmanishq, was announced on 29 July 2013 in Mumbai. Beginning in Sydney on 24 August, the tour moved to a number of cities in India. In January 2016, after a long break A. R. Rahman performed live in Chennai and for the first time in Coimbatore & Madurai, with a complete Tamil playlist. As the name suggests, Nenje Yezhu (which means rise up) began 2016 with a positive note and with music from the heart. The proceeds of this concert will be used for flood relief in Tamil Nadu and also for creating awareness against cancer, supporting VS Medical Trust outside Chennai. Skilled in Carnatic music, Western and Hindustani classical music and the Qawwali style of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Rahman is noted for film songs amalgamating elements of these and other genres, layering instruments from different musical idioms in an improvisational style. Symphonic orchestral themes accompany his scores, occasionally using a leitmotif. During the 1980s Rahman recorded monaural arrangements in common with his musical predecessors, K. V. Mahadevan and Vishwanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy. In later years his methodology changed, as he experimented with the fusion of traditional instruments with new electronic sounds and technology. Rahman's musical interests and outlook originate in his love of experimentation. His compositions have an auteuristic use of counterpoint, orchestration and the human voice, melding Indian pop music with a unique timbre, form and instrumentation. With this syncretic style and wide-ranging lyrics, the appeal of Rahman's music crosses classes and cultures in Indian society. His first soundtrack, for Roja, was listed on Time's all-time \"10 Best Soundtracks\" in 2005. Film critic Richard Corliss said that the composer's \"astonishing debut work parades Rahman's gift for alchemizing outside influences until they are totally Tamil, totally Rahman\", and his initial global success is attributed to the South Asian diaspora. Music producer Ron Fair considers Rahman \"one of the world's great living composers in any medium\". Director Baz Luhrmann said: I had come to the music of A. R. Rahman through the emotional and haunting score of Bombay and the wit and celebration of Lagaan. But the more of AR's music I encountered the more I was to be amazed at the sheer diversity of styles: from swinging brass bands to triumphant anthems; from joyous pop to West-End musicals. Whatever the style, A. R. Rahman's music always possesses a profound sense of humanity and spirit, qualities that inspire me the most. Rahman introduced 7.1 surround sound technology to South Indian films. On 21 May 2014 Rahman announced that he has partnered with former Black Eyed Peas\u2019 Will.i.am to recreate an early popular track 'Urvashi Urvashi'. Track is 'Birthday'. Rahman was the 1995 recipient of the Mauritius National Award and the Malaysian Award for his contributions to music, and was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for his first West End production. A four-time National Film Award winner and recipient of six Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, he has fifteen Filmfare Awards and thirteen Filmfare Awards South for his music. Rahman has received a Kalaimamani from the Government of Tamil Nadu for excellence in the field of music, musical-achievement awards from the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh and a Padma Shri from the Government of India. In 2006, he received an award from Stanford University for his contributions to global music. The following year, Rahman entered the Limca Book of Records as \"Indian of the Year for Contribution to Popular Music\". He received the 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rotary Club of Madras. In 2009, for his Slumdog Millionaire score, Rahman won the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music and two Academy Awards (Best Original Score and Best Original Song, the latter shared with Gulzar) at the 81st Academy Awards. He has received honorary doctorates from Middlesex University, Aligarh Muslim University, Anna University in Chennai and Miami University in Ohio. The composer has won two Grammy Awards: Best Compilation Soundtrack Album and Best Song Written for Visual Media. Rahman received the Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian honour, in 2010. His work in 127 Hours won him Golden Globe, BAFTA, and two Academy Award nominations (Best Original Music Score and Best Original Song) in 2011. Rahman is an Honorary Fellow of the Trinity College of Music. On 24 October 2014 Rahman was awarded an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music during a concert paying tribute to his music featuring an international cast of students. Upon receiving his award he commented that being honored by Berklee illustrates how his life has come full circle, as at the start of his career, he had planned to study at Berklee before being offered the opportunity to score Roja. During his 7 May 2012 acceptance speech of his honorary doctorate from Miami University in Ohio, Rahman mentioned that he received a Christmas card from the family of the President of the United States and an invitation to dinner at the White House. A street was named in his honour in Markham, Ontario, Canada in November 2013. On 4 October 2015, the government of Seychelles named A. R. Rahman Cultural Ambassador for Seychelles in appreciation of the \"invaluable services contributed to enhance Seychelles' Arts and Culture development.\" Rahman is married to Saira Banu and has three children: Khatija, Rahima and Ameen. Ameen has sung \"NaNa\" from Couples Retreat, and Khatija has sung \"Pudhiya Manidha\" from Enthiran. Rahman is the uncle of composer G. V. Prakash Kumar, the son of his older sister A. R. Reihana. Kumar's first film work was singing on Rahman's \"Chikku Bukku Rayile\", from his score for 1993's Gentleman. Reihana's film debut was singing on \"Vidai Kodu Engal Naadae\" from Kannathil Muthamittal, and she is a music director. Rahman's younger sister, Fathima, heads his music conservatory in Chennai. The youngest, Ishrath, has a music studio. A.R.Rahman is the co-brother of film actor Rahman. Born Hindu in a Tamil Mudaliar family, Dileep Kumar converted to Islam in 1989 and assumed his present name, Rahman. After the early death of his father, his family experienced difficult times; Sufism influenced his mother who was a practicing Hindu and, eventually, his family. During the 81st Academy Awards ceremony Rahman paid tribute to his mother: \"There is a Hindi dialogue, mere pass ma hai, which means 'even if I have got nothing I have my mother here'.\" He said, \"Ella pughazhum iraivanukke\" (\"All praise to God\" in Tamil, a translation from the Quran) before his speech. Rahman is involved with a number of charitable causes. In 2004 he was appointed global ambassador of the Stop TB Partnership, a WHO project. Rahman has supported Save the Children India and worked with Yusuf Islam on \"Indian Ocean\", a song featuring a-ha keyboard player Magne Furuholmen and Travis drummer Neil Primrose. Proceeds from the song went to help orphans in Banda Aceh who were affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. He produced the single \"We Can Make It Better\" by Don Asian with Mukhtar Sahota. In 2008 Rahman opened the KM Music Conservatory with an audio-media education facility to train aspiring musicians in vocals, instruments, music technology and sound design. The conservatory (with prominent musicians on staff and a symphony orchestra) is located near his studio in Kodambakkam, Chennai and offers courses at several levels. Violinist L. Subramaniam is on its advisory board. Several of Rahman's proteges from the studio have scored feature films. He composed the theme music for a 2006 short film for The Banyan to aid poor women in Chennai. In 2008 Rahman and noted percussionist Sivamani created a song, \"Jiya Se Jiya\", inspired by the Free Hugs Campaign and promoted it with a video filmed in a number of Indian cities."

        "artist_name": "Asha_Bhosle", 
        "biography": " Asha Bhosle (born 8 September 1933), is an Indian singer. She is best known as a playback singer in Hindi cinema, although she has a wider repertoire. Bhosle's career started in 1943 and has spanned over six decades. She has done playback singing for over a thousand Bollywood movies. In addition, she has recorded several private albums and participated in numerous solo concerts in India and abroad. Bhosle is the sister of playback singer Lata Mangeshkar. Renowned for her voice range and often credited for her versatility, Bhosle's work includes film music, pop, ghazals, bhajans, traditional Indian classical music, folk songs, qawwalis, and Rabindra Sangeets. Apart from Hindi, she has sung in over 20 Indian and foreign languages. In 2006, Asha Bhosle stated that she had sung over 12,000 songs, a figure repeated by several other sources. In 2011, she was officially acknowledged by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most recorded artist in music history. The Government of India honoured her with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008. In 2013, she made her debut as an actress in the film Mai, and received critical acclaim for her performance.   Asha Bhosle was born in the small hamlet of Goar in Sangli, then in the salute princely state of Sangli. (now in Maharashtra), into the musical family of Master Deenanath Mangeshkar, who belongs to Marathi-speaking Gomantak Maratha Samaj. Her father was an actor and classical singer on Marathi Musical stage. When she was nine years old, her father died. The family moved from Pune to Kolhapur and then to Mumbai. She and her elder sister Lata Mangeshkar began singing and acting in films to support their family. She sang her first film song '\"Chala Chala Nav Bala\" for the Marathi film Majha Bal (1943). The music for the film was composed by Datta Davjekar. She made her Hindi film debut when she sang the song \"Saawan Aaya\" for Hansraj Behl's Chunariya (1948). Her first solo Hindi film song was for the movie Raat Ki Raani (1949). At the age of 16, she eloped with 31-year-old Ganpatrao Bhosle, marrying him against her family's wishes. In the early 1960s, prominent playback singers like Geeta Dutt, Shamshad Begum, and Lata Mangeshkar dominated the singing for the female lead and the big films. Asha used to get the assignments they refused: singing for the bad girls and vamps, or songs in the second-grade movies. In the 1950s, she sang more songs than most playback singers in Bollywood. Most of these were in low budget B or C-grade films. Her earliest songs were composed by A R Qureshi, Sajjad Hussain, and Ghulam Mohammed, and most of these songs failed to do well. Singing in Sangdil (1952), composed by Sajjad Hussain, she got reasonable recognition. Consequently, film director Bimal Roy gave her a chance to sing in Parineeta (1953). Raj Kapoor signed her to sing \"Nanhe Munne Bachche\" with Mohammed Rafi in Boot Polish (1954), which gained popularity.[citation needed] O. P. Nayyar gave Asha a break in C.I.D. (1956). She first achieved success in B. R. Chopra's Naya Daur (1957), composed by him. Her duets with Rafi like \"Maang Ke Saath Tumhara\", \"Saathi Haath Badhana\" and \"Uden Jab Jab Zulfein Teri\", penned by Sahir Ludhianvi, earned her recognition. It was the first time she sang all the songs for a film's leading actress. Chopra approached her for several of his later productions, including Gumrah (1963), Waqt (1965), Hamraaz (1965), Aadmi Aur Insaan (1966) and Dhund (1973). Nayyar's future collaboration with Bhosle also resulted in success. Gradually, she established her status and received the patronage of such composers as Sachin Dev Burman and Ravi. Bhosle and Nayyar had a professional and personal parting of ways in the 1970s.[citation needed] In 1966, Bhosle's performances in the duets from one of music director R.D. Burman's first soundtracks, for the movie Teesri Manzil, won popular acclaim. Reportedly, when she first heard the dance number \"Aaja Aaja\", she felt she would not be able to sing this westernised tune. While Burman offered to change the music, she refused, taking it as a challenge. She completed the song after ten days of rehearsals, and \"Aaja Aaja\", along with such other songs as \"O Haseena Zulfonwali\" and \"O Mere Sona Re\" (all three duets with Rafi), became successful. Shammi Kapoor, the film's leading actor, was once quoted as saying\u2013 \"If I did not have Mohammad Rafi to sing for me, I would have got Asha Bhosle to do the job\". Bhosle's collaboration with Burman resulted in numerous hits and a marriage. During the 1960-70s, she was the voice of Bollywood's actress and dancer, Helen, on whom \"O Haseena Zulfon Wali\" was picturised. It is said that Helen would attend her recording sessions so that she could understand the song better and plan dance steps accordingly. Some of their other popular numbers include \"Piya Tu Ab To Aaja\" (Caravan) and \"Yeh Mera Dil\" (Don), among others. By the 1980s, Bhosle, although highly regarded[by whom?] for her abilities and versatility, had sometimes been stereotyped[by whom?] as a \"cabaret singer\" and a \"pop crooner\". In 1981 she attempted a different genre by singing several ghazals for the Rekha-starrer Umrao Jaan, including \"Dil Cheez Kya Hai\", \"In Aankhon Ki Masti Ke\", \"Yeh Kya Jagah Hai Doston\" and \"Justaju Jiski Thi\". The film's music director Khayyam, had lowered her pitch by half a note. Bhosle herself expressed surprise that she could sing so differently. The ghazals won her the first National Film Award of her career. A few years later, she won another National Award for the song \"Mera Kuchh Saamaan\" from Ijaazat (1987). In 1995, 62-year-old Bhosle sang for actress Urmila Matondkar in the movie Rangeela. The soundtrack featured songs like \"Tanha Tanha\" and \"Rangeela Re\" sung by her, and composed by music director A. R. Rahman, who would go on to record several songs with her. During the 2000s, several of Bhosle's numbers became chartbusters, including \"Radha Kaise Na Jale\" from Lagaan (2001), \"Kambakht Ishq\" from Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya (2001), \"Yeh Lamha\" from Filhaal (2002), \"Lucky Lips\" from Lucky (2005). In October 2004, The Very Best of Asha Bhosle, The Queen of Bollywood, a compilation album of songs recorded by Bhosle for albums and Bollywood films that were released between 1966 and 2003, was released. In 2012 she judged Sur Kshetra. In 2013, Bhosle debuted in the film Mai in the title role, at the age of 79. Bhosle played the role of a 65-year-old mother who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and is abandoned by her children. She received positive reviews for her acting as well from critics. Music director O. P. Nayyar's association with Asha is part of Bollywood lore. He was the composer who first gave Asha her own identity. Many people have speculated about a romantic relationship between the two. Nayyar first met Asha in 1952, at the music recording of Chham Chhama Chham. He first called her for a film called Mangu (1954), and gave her a big break in CID (1956). However, it was the success of Naya Daur (1957), that made the duo very popular. After 1959, she was emotionally and professionally involved with Nayyar. The team of O.P. Nayyar and Asha Bhosle is best remembered for their breezy and sometimes sirenish songs. Some good examples of their sensuous numbers are \"Aaiye Meherbaan\" picturised on Madhubala (Howrah Bridge, 1958) and \"Yeh Hai Reshmi Zulfon Ka Andhera\" picturised on Mumtaz (Mere Sanam, 1965). \"Aao Huzoor Tumko\" (Kismat) and \"Jaaiye Aap Kahan\" (Mere Sanam) were also popular. They also recorded songs for many hit movies like Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957), Ek Musafir Ek Hasina (1962), Kashmir Ki Kali (1964). O.P. Nayyar used the Asha Bhosle-Mohammad Rafi duo for his most popular duets such as \"Ude Jab Jab Zulfein Teri\" (Naya Daur), \"Main Pyaar Ka Rahi Hoon\" (Ek Musafir Ek Haseena), \"Deewana Hua Baadal\" and '\"Ishaaron Ishaaron Mein\" (Kashmir Ki Kali).[citation needed] Asha recorded her last song for O.P. Nayyar in the movie Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye (1974). The solo number \"Chain Se\" got many awards, but it was not included in the movie. They split on 5 August 1972. It is not clear what made them part their ways. On being asked the reason for their parting, O P Nayyar once said, \"I know astrology very well. I knew that one day I had to part with her. Something also happened, that upset me, so I left her.\" Nevertheless, he also said \"...now that I am seventy-six, I can say that the most important person in my life was Asha Bhosle. She was the best person I ever met.\" The parting of Asha Bhosle and O.P. Nayyar was bitter, and probably therefore she has hesitated to give Nayyar his due. While talking about O.P. Nayyar in an interview with The Times of India, she once remarked\u00a0\u2013 \"Whichever composer gave me work, it was because my voice was suited to his music at that point. No one musician did me any favor by asking me to sing for him.\" She gives the credit for her first big break to B. R. Chopra, the producer of Naya Daur. Another music director who recognized Asha's talent early was Khayyam. Their partnership dates back to his first movie Biwi (1948). Khayyam gave her some good assignments in the 1950s, including Dard and Phir Subah Hogi. But the team is chiefly remembered for the songs of Umrao Jaan. Music composer Ravi considered Asha one of his favorite singers. She sang for his first movie Vachan (1955). The melodious lullaby from the movie, \"Chandamama Door Ke!\" became an overnight hit among young mothers in India. Ravi got her to sing bhajans for the movies Gharana, Grihasti, Kajal and Phool Aur Patthar, at a time when most of the composers remembered her only when they needed to record B-grade songs picturized on the vamps or the side-heroines. Ravi and Asha recorded a variety of songs, including the popular funny duet with Kishore Kumar\u00a0\u2013 \"C A T...Cat. Cat Maane Billi\" (Dilli Ka Thug). The bhajan \"Tora Maan Darpan\" (Kajal) is considered one of Asha's best songs.[citation needed] They also recorded songs for many popular movies like Waqt, Chaudhvin Ka Chand, Gumrah, Bahu Beti, China Town, Aadmi Aur Insaan, Dhund and Humraaz. For Chaudhvin Ka Chand, Ravi wanted Geeta Dutt (the wife of actor and producer Guru Dutt) to sing the songs. But when she backed out, Guru Dutt insisted that Asha sing the songs. One of Bollywood's most famous composers, Sachin Dev Burman and his favorite singer, Lata Mangeshkar, were not on good terms from 1957 to 1962. During this period, S D Burman used Asha as his lead female voice. She and Burman gave many hit songs in movies such as Kaala Pani, Kaala Bazaar, Insaan Jaag Utha, Lajwanti, Sujata and Teen Deviyaan (1965). They recorded many songs together after 1962 as well. Most famous of these songs were Asha's duets with Mohammed Rafi and Kishore Kumar. The song \"Ab Ke Baras\" in Bimal Roy's Bandini (1963) consolidated her position as a lead singer. The seductive song \"Raat Akeli Hai\" from Jewel Thief (1967), picturised on Tanuja, became very popular.[citation needed] Asha first met Rahul Dev Burman (also known as \"Pancham\") when she was the mother of two and he was in 10th grade having dropped out to pursue music. Their partnership was first noticed in Teesri Manzil (1966). She went on to record a variety of songs with him\u00a0\u2013 cabarets, rock, disco, ghazals and classical. In the 1970s, Asha and Pancham's youthful Western songs took Bollywood music by storm\u00a0\u2013 the raunchy cabaret \"Piya Tu Ab To Aaja\" (Caravan, picturized on Helen), the rebellious \"Dum Maro Dum\" (Hare Rama Hare Krishna, 1971), the sexy \"Duniya Mein\" (Apna Desh, 1972) and the romantic \"Chura Liyaa Hai Tumne\" (Yaadon Ki Baaraat, 1973). Pancham also recorded many hit duets with Asha and Kishore Kumar such as \"Jaane Jaan\" (Jawani Diwani) and \"Bhali Bhali Si Ek Soorat\" (Buddha Mil Gaya). In 1980s, Pancham and Asha recorded subtle numbers for films like Ijaazat (1987)- \"Mera Kuch Saaman\", \"Khaali Haath Shaam Aayi Hai\" and \"Katra Katra\". They also recorded the popular duet \"O Maria!\" (Saagar). Asha used to call R D Burman \"Bubs\". She married him in 1980. Their partnership lasted until his death. R D Burman made her sing some of the most legendary songs in Bengali language as well, namely \"Mohuyae Jomechhe Aaj Mou Go\", \"Chokhe Chokhe Kotha Bolo\", \"Chokhhe Naame Brishti\"(Bengali version of \"Jaane Kya Baat Hai\"), \"Baanshi Sune Ki Ghore Thaka Jaye\", \"Sondhya Belae Tumi Aami\" and \"Aaj Gungun Gun Gunje Amar\" (Bengali version of \"Pyaar Deewana Hota Hai\"). Prolific Indian film composer Ilaiyaraaja began employing Asha's vocals in the early 1980s, their earliest collaboration being for the film Moondram Pirai (1982) (remade in Hindi as Sadma in 1983). Their association continued, mostly through the latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s. Another notable song from this period is \"Shenbagamae\" (Enga Ooru Paattukkaaran, 1987, Tamil). In 2000, Asha sung the theme song for Kamal Haasan's political film Hey Ram. The song, \"Nee Partha Parvai\" (Janmon Ki Jwala in Hindi) (or Aparna's Theme), was a duet with singer Hariharan. A. R. Rahman is credited with Asha's 'comeback' with Rangeela (1994). Songs like \"Tanha Tanha\" and \"Rangeela Re\" were chartbusters. She and Rahman went on to record more hits like \"Mujhe Rang De\" (Thakshak), \"Radha Kaise Na Jale\" (Lagaan, duet with Udit Narayan), \"Kahin Aag Lage\" (Taal), \"O Bhanware\" (Daud, duet with K. J. Yesudas), \"Venilla Venilla\" (Iruvar,1999) and \"Dhuan Dhuan\" (Meenaxi,2004). When S D Burman's assistant Jaidev started giving music independently, he got Asha to sing some of his songs as well. They worked in Hum Dono (1961), Mujhe Jeene Do (1963), Do Boond Pani (1971) and other movies. In 1971, the pair released an LP of eight non-film devotional songs and ghazals called An Unforgettable Treat. Asha considered Jaidev a close friend who stood by her when she was struggling personally and professionally. Upon his death in 1987, she released a compilation album of lesser-known songs he had composed for her, called Suranjali.[citation needed] Shankar-Jaikishan worked relatively little with Asha. However, the trio produced quite a few hits including the seductive \"Parde Mein Rehne Do\" (Shikar, 1968). Asha got her second Filmfare Award for the song. She also sang \"Zindagi Ek Safar Hai Suhana\" (Andaz, 1971) for Shankar-Jaikishan, in which she tried to yodel like Kishore Kumar, whose version of the song is more better known. When Raj Kapoor was not on speaking terms with Lata Mangeshkar, Asha got to sing the songs of Mera Naam Joker (1970), composed by Shankar-Jaikishan. Composer Anu Malik and Asha have recorded many hit songs together, including songs for his first movie Sohni Mahiwal (1984). Their most popular songs include \"Ye Lamhaa Filhaal\" (Filhaal) and \"Kitabein Bahut Si\" (Baazigar) among others. The four lines sung by Asha in Malik's \"Jab Dil Mile\" (Yaadein) stood out among voices of Sukhwinder Singh, Udit Narayan and Sunidhi Chauhan. Asha had also sung for Anu's father Sardar Malik in the 1950s and 1960s, most notably in Saranga (1960). Madan Mohan recorded a number of songs with Asha, including the popular folk number \"Jhumka Gira Re\" from Mera Saaya (1966). In Chhoti Si Baat (1975), Asha sang the \"Jaaneman Jaaneman\" number with K. J. Yesudas for Salil Chowdhury. Salil's 1956 movie Jagte Raho also had a number recorded by Asha, \"Thandi Thandi Saawan Ki Phuhaar\". Another Asha patron is the young composer Sandeep Chowta, who got her to sing \"Kambakht Ishq\", a duet with Sonu Nigam for the movie Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya(2001). The song gained major popularity among the Indian youth. Asha has worked with Lata-patrons like Laxmikant-Pyarelal, Naushad Ali, Ravindra Jain, N Dutta and Hemant Kumar. When Naushad was asked to sum up the essential difference between Lata and Asha, he said that Asha \"lacks certain something which Lata, and Lata alone has\". Later he accepted in an interview, \"May be I said it because I then had a closed ear on Asha\". Naushad, later in his life, also admitted that he has been unfair to Asha. Asha has also worked with other noted Bollywood composers like Jatin-Lalit, Bappi Lahiri, Kalyanji-Anandji, Usha Khanna, Chitragupt, and Roshan. In a rare feat, noted lyricist Gulzar, music director R.D. Burman and Asha Bhosle came together in 1987 to create a double album, titled Dil Padosi Hai, which was released on 8 September 1987. In 1995, Asha underwent the gatha bandan (thread-tying) ceremony with Hindustani classical music maestro Ali Akbar Khan to learn a classical repertoire held within the Maihar gharana (stylistic school of Indian classical music), as handed down to Khan by his father Allauddin Khan (the guru of Ravi Shankar). Later, Asha and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan recorded eleven fixed compositions (or bandishes) in California for Legacy, a private album that earned them a Grammy Award nomination. In 1990s, Asha experimented with remixed R.D. Burman songs. She was criticized by many, including Khayyam for tampering with old melodies. Nevertheless, albums like Rahul And I became quite popular. In 1997, Asha did a private Indipop album Janam Samjha Karo with Lesle Lewis. The album was hugely popular and won her many awards including the 1997 MTV Award. Asha had been once asked by director B R Ishaara to compose music for one of his films, but she had politely declined. In 2002, she turned music composer with the album Aap Ki Asha, an eight-song music and video album. The lyrics were written by Majrooh Sultanpuri (his last lyrics). The album was released by Sachin Tendulkar on 21 May 2001 at a lavish party in Mumbai. The album received mixed reviews. Asha had spotted Pakistani singer Adnan Sami's talent when he was about 10 years old. At that time, she was performing in London, with R D Burman. It was she who had asked him to pursue his interests in music seriously. When Adnan grew up and became a professional musician, Asha sang the title duet with him for his best-selling album Kabhi to nazar milao. The two came together again in the album Barse Badal. The album comprises eight songs, based on Indian Classical music. She contributed the song Yun Na Thi to the recording Womad Talking Book Volume Four: An Introduction to Asia 1 on Womad Records. Asha has sung ghazals for many albums like Meraj-E-Ghazal, Aabshar-E-Ghazal and Kashish. In 2005, Asha released a self-titled album as a tribute to the four ghazal maestros\u00a0\u2013 Mehdi Hassan, Ghulam Ali, Farida Khanum and Jagjit Singh. The album features eight of her favorite ghazals like Farida Khanum\u2019s Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo, Ghulam Ali\u2019s Chupke Chupke, Aawargi and Dil Mein Ek Lahar, Jagjit Singh\u2019s Ahista Ahista and Mehdi Hassan\u2019s Ranjish Hi Sahi, Rafta Rafta and Mujhe Tum Nazar Se. These classic ghazals were recreated with modern sounds by musician Pandit Somesh Mathur. The album was aimed at the younger generation, who, according to Asha, are \"turned off\" by the traditional sounds of tabla and sarangi. Numerous compilations of Asha's songs have been released as well. To commemorate her 60th birthday, EMI India released three cassettes: Bala Main Bairagan Hoongi (devotional songs), The Golden Collection: Memorable Ghazals (non-film ghazals by composers such as Ghulam Ali, R.D. Burman and Nazar Hussain), and The Golden Collection: The Ever Versatile Asha Bhosle (44 popular film songs). In 1996, Asha Bhosle sang Channeache Rati among several other songs in Rajendra Talak's Konkani album Daryachya Deger with Suresh Wadkar. In 2006, she recorded an album Asha and Friends, singing duets, with film actors Sanjay Dutt and Urmila Matondkar and famous cricket player Brett Lee, with whom she sang, You're the One for Me (Haan Main Tumhara Hoon). All these songs composed by Shamir Tandon were shot on video by journalist turned director S Ramachandran. In 2014, she sang a song titled \"Dil Lagane Ko Dil Jab\" for the International Women's Day special album, Women's Day Special: Spreading Melodies Everywhere. It was composed by Shamir Tandon and penned by Saajan Agarwal. In 2016, she recorded an album \"82\" with music director Mandar Agashe who decorated six of Suresh Bhat's ghazals with his musical touch of pop, reggae, blues, and rock. The album was named after her age at the time of recording. About the album '82', Bhosle said, \"I had a long association with Suresh Bhat and have a lot of memories about him. With this album, I will relive those memories. I don't need to tell you how powerful his words were and, with the album, that power can be experienced again. Mr. Bhat always wanted to record these ghazals in the pop and rock genres and it is good to see Mandar fulfilling that wish. I just wish Mr. Bhat was among us today.\" In 1980s and 1990s, Asha went globe-trotting, staging concerts in Canada, Dubai, UK, U.S. and many other countries. In 1989, during a world tour, she performed in 13 US cities in 20 days. Immediately after this, she had an already sold-out concert scheduled in Stockholm, Sweden. Due to the stressful schedule, Asha suffered a massive attack of colitis, together with fever, cough and weakness. In Stockholm, a pre-concert crisis meeting was called, attended by Asha's son (and manager) Anand and the sponsors. It was decided that the orchestra will play many instrumental tracks, the accompanying singers like Suresh Wadkar would shoulder the load, and Asha will make a small appearance. But Asha rejected all such proposals and sang at the concert with great difficulty, in a not-so-good voice. Her first set of six Bollywood songs did not receive any response from the audience, which consisted mostly of Indian and Pakistani expats. Before the start of the second set of songs, a fan in the crowd requested her to sing a Marathi song. Asha obliged and sang \"Naach-naachuni ati mi damale\" (\"I'm very tired of this endless dancing\"). When the song ended, the auditorium erupted with claps and the encores started. After the concert, Asha was in bed for a month, recuperating from overexertion. In October 2002, she did a concert with Sudesh Bhosle and others, in London, for \"Help the Aged\" to help raise funds for the elderly in India. In 2007 she toured the US, Canada, and West Indies in a tour called \"The Incredibles\". In this tour, she was accompanied by singers Sonu Nigam, Kunal Ganjawala and Kailash Kher. This tour, originally scheduled for only 12 concerts, went on to hold more than 20. In the mid-1980s, Asha sang with Boy George (\"Bow down mister\") and Stephen Lauscombe. In 1997, she sang a love song with the boy band Code Red, at the age of 64. She also recorded the song \"The Way you Dream\" (One Giant Leap,) with Michael Stipe that was used in the English movie, Bulletproof Monk. The song was also released on the album 1 Giant Leap for 2002. In 1997, the British band Cornershop paid tribute to Asha with their song \"Brimful of Asha,\" an international hit which was later remixed by Fatboy Slim. In 2001, the CD single of Nelly Furtado's \"I'm Like a Bird\" included a \"Nellie vs. Asha Remix\" created by Digital Cutup Lounge. In 2003, British opera pop singer Sarah Brightman sampled her song \"Dil Cheez Kya Hai\" on her album Harem. It was used as the intro for her song \"You Take My Breath Away\". In 2005, American string quartet Kronos Quartet re-recorded R D Burman compositions like \"Chura Liya\", \"Piya Tu\", \"Mera Kuchh Saaman\" among others and got Asha to sing them. Despite her age, she recorded three to four songs in a day, leaving the quartet members stupefied. On 23 August 2005, You've Stolen My Heart: Songs from R.D. Burman's Bollywood was released in US. The album was nominated for Grammy Awards 2006 in the category of \"Best Contemporary World Music Album\". In the 1990s, a friend had introduced David Harrington of Kronos Quartet to the song \"Aaj ki raat.\" Harrington was mesmerised, and the song ended up on the album Kronos Caravan. Also in 2005, The Black Eyed Peas sampled her songs \"Ae Naujawan Sab Kuchh Yahan\" (Apradh, 1972) and \"Yeh Mera Dil Pyaar Ka Diwana\" (Don, 1978) in their hit single \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\". In late 2006, Asha collaborated with Australian test cricket star, Brett Lee. The single, You're the One for Me, debuted at number 4 on the charts and reached a peak position of number 2. In 2006 Asha recorded one song for the soundtrack of Pakistani movie Mein Ek Din Laut Kay Aaaonga. She sang the song, titled \"Dil Key Taar Bajey\", with famous Pakistani pop singer Jawad Ahmed. It was aired as part of the film's promotional campaign and became very popular, featuring on top music charts. Asha Bhosle sang her first Bengali song in 1958 under the banner of HMV. The songs were duets with Binod Chattopadhyay and composed by Manna Dey. The following year, she recorded her very first \"Pooja Songs\" from HMV with music arranged by Dey again. She sang a lot of pooja songs in Bengali. Rahul converted some Hindi tracks to Bengali such as \"Gunjone Dole Je Bhramar\" (made from Gunguna Rahe Hain Bawre in Aradhana), \"Chokhe Name Bristi\" (from Jane Kya Baat Hai), \"Gungun Gunje\" (from Pyaar Deewana Hota Hain). In the mid 1970s, she would frequently sing for Bengali songs tuned by Sudhin Dasgupta, Nachiketa Ghosh rtc. In 1975, she sang the duet \"Sara Pyaar Tumhara\" with Kishore Kumar in Anand Ashram and \"Amar Swapno Tumi\" in its Bengali version with the same title. In the 1970s, she sang a lot of songs in the films like Chhadmabeshi, Bandi, Mouchak, Anand Ashram etc. In 1980, she sang Bhajan \"Kunjo Bihari He Giridhari\" in Mayer Ashirbad film.

In 2014, She has brought an album calles \"Pancham Tumi Kothay\" in the memory of her husband Rahul Dev Burman's 75th birth anniversary. In this album she has sung 8 songs previously composed by Burman. She has also sung in a 2014 film Parapar at the age of 81. Asha's house is situated in Prabhukunj Apt on the Peddar Road area of South Mumbai. Asha, at the age of 16, had eloped with 31-year-old Ganpatrao Bhosle. They separated in 1960. They have three children and five grandchildren. The eldest of her three children, Hemant Bhosle (named after Hemant Kumar), spent most of his early years as a pilot and quit to have a brief career as a music director. Bhosle's daughter Varsha committed suicide on 8 October 2012; she was 56 years old and worked as a columnist for The Sunday Observer and Rediff. Asha's youngest child, Anand Bhosle, has studied business and film direction. He manages Asha's career. Her grandson, Chaitanya (Chintu) Bhosle (Hemant's son) is a part of the world of music. He is a member of India's first & only boy band, \"A Band of Boys\". Her sisters Lata and Usha Mangeshkar are playback singers. Her other, sister Meena Mangeshkar and brother Hridaynath Mangeshkar are music directors. Hemant Bhosle 's best known composed duets were the Kishore Asha duets like Aji Kaho Kya Haal Hai from An padh picturised on Vijendra Ghatke and Sarika and Salamat Raho Tum from same film Anpadh picturised on Ashok Kumar and Sarika. Her son Hemant died of cancer in 2015. Asha's first husband Ganpatrao was her personal secretary. Their marriage failed miserably in 1960. Her husband and in-laws mistreated her. After a few years of marriage, Asha was turned out by a suspicious Ganpatrao and she went to her maternal home with two children and pregnant with her third child. She continued to sing in films to earn money. Asha married Rahul Dev Burman in 1980. This was second marriage for both Rahul and Asha. Rahul, 6 years younger than her, earlier got divorced from Rita Patel in 1971. Asha is an excellent cook and cooking is her favorite hobby. She often gets flooded with requests by Bollywood celebrities for kadai ghosht and biryani dishes and has rarely turned down a request. In fact, her paya curry, Goan fish curry and dal are very popular with the Kapoor family of Bollywood. Once, when asked in a Times of India interview, what if her singing career had not taken off, she said \"I would have become a cook. I'd have cooked in four houses and made money.\" The love of cooking got Asha into the a successful restaurant business. She runs restaurants in Dubai and Kuwait, called Asha's. Asha's offers traditional north-western Indian cuisine. It has a presence in the Wafi City development in Dubai, as well as three restaurants in Kuwait, at The Avenues Mall, the Marina Mall and a brand new third outlet at the Spoons Complex. Other restaurants can be found in Abu Dhabi's Khaldiya Mall, Doha's Villagio and Bahrain's City Center Mall, with future outposts planned for Dubai's Mall of the Emirates and Cairo, Egypt. Asha Bhosle has a 20% stake in the business. Asha is not involved in day-to-day running of the restaurant which is looked after by the Wafi Group. She takes care of the kitchen and the d\u00e9cor. She personally trained the chefs for almost six months. According to a December 2004 report in the Menu Magazine, Russell Scott, a former head of Harry Ramsden's (the fish and chips chain), secured the UK rights to the Asha's brand and planned to open up to 40 restaurants over the next five years. As part of her chain of restaurants, Asha has recently opened a new restaurant in Birmingham, UK. Asha's sibling rivalry with Lata Mangeshkar is often talked about, in spite of their insistence that these are just tales. As young children, they were very close. As a child, Lata used to carry Asha all the time. They were so inseparable that when Lata went to school she would take Asha with her. One day the teacher protested and said that they cannot have two students on one fee. Lata refused to return to school without Asha and quit her studies. Lata considered Asha's act of eloping with her lover as irresponsible, leaving her alone to sing and earn for the family. This led to tensions between them. Asha herself accepted in an interview\u00a0\u2014 \"It was a love marriage and Lata didi did not speak to me for a long time. She disapproved of the alliance.\" At one time, their relationship was very adversarial and there have been periods of non-communication. In her initial days in the industry, Asha always played second fiddle to her elder sister. Some say that Lata had once criticised Asha's relationship with O. P. Nayyar. This widened the rift between the two sisters and O P Nayyar also decided that he would never work with Lata. O.P. Nayyar had once revealed \"Asha and Lata, staying in opposite flats at Bombay's Peddar Road, shared a maid. Said maid's, responsibility was to come and tell the younger sister that Lata had just recorded something wonderful for Asha to lose her vocal poise. Such was her Lata phobia that it took me some months to convince Asha that she had a voice individualistic enough to evolve a singing style all of her own.\" Asha once said that she has worked for years to create a voice and a style that was different from Lata, so that she could carve her own niche and not be banished to live in her sister's shadow. Asha and Lata have also sung together. Their first duet was for the film Daman (1951). Some of their songs include Man Bhawan Ke Ghar aye (Chori Chori, 1956), Sakhi ri sun bole papihaa us paar (Miss Mary, 1957), O chaand jahaan woh jaaye (Sharada, 1957), Mere Mehboob Mein Kya Nahi (Mere Mehboob, 1963), Ai kash kisi deewane ko (Aaye Din Bahar Ke, 1966), Jabse Laagi Toose Najariya (Shikar, 1968), Main Haseena Nazneena Koi Mujhsa Nahi (Baazi, 1968), Main Chali Main Chali (Padosan, 1968), Chhap tilak sab (Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki, 1978), and Man kyun behka (Utsav, 1984). While singing, Lata used to hold her notebook in her right hand, while Asha held hers in the left hand. This meant Lata had her face away from Asha, making it difficult for them to \"anticipate\" each other. The movie Saaz, was supposedly based on Lata and Asha's rivalry. Asha said about the movie\u00a0\u2014 \"To have two women in long plaits, take a couple of incidents and exaggerate them into a 3-hour film is such a waste of time.\" In the last few years, Asha and Lata have often been seen in public, enjoying each other's company. In an interview with The Times of India, Asha once said\u00a0\u2013 \"I remember, sometimes both of us would be at a function and some industry types would ignore me and interact only with her, as if to prove their loyalty. Later, didi and I would have a good laugh!\" British alternative rock band Cornershop released \"Brimful of Asha\" in 1997. The song dedicated to Asha Bhosle became an international hit single for the band and topping the UK Singles Chart in February 1998. A number of remixes have been released as well, notably by Norman Cook, also known as Fatboy Slim. Asha Bhosle has won seven Filmfare Best Female Playback Awards of 18 nominations. She won her first two awards in 1967 and 1968. (Mangeshkar asked not to be considered for the award nominations after 1969 to promote new talent). After receiving the award in 1979, Bhosle emulated her elder sister and requested that her name not be considered for the nominations hereafter. Despite this, Bhosle is the most frequent winner of this award to date, tying with Alka Yagnik. She was later given a Special Award for Rangeela in 1996, and the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001. Following is the list of her Filmfare Awards: Asha has won the National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer twice: IIFA Award for Best Female Playback Asha has won numerous other awards, including:"

His songs, written and sung mainly in the Assamese language by himself, are marked by humanity and universal brotherhood and have been translated and sung in many languages, most notably in Bengali and Hindi. His songs, based on the themes of communal amity, universal justice and empathy, have become popular among the people of Assam, besides West Bengal and Bangladesh. He is also acknowledged to have introduced the culture and folk music of Assam and Northeast India to Hindi cinema at the national level. He received the National Film Award for Best Music Direction in 1975. Recipient of Sangeet Natak Akademi Award (1987), Padmashri (1997), and Padmabhushan (2001), Hazarika was awarded with Dada Saheb Phalke Award (1992), India's highest award in cinema, by the Government of India and Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship (2008), the highest award of the Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's The National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama. He was posthumously awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India's second-highest civilian award, in 2012. Hazarika also held the position of the Chairman of the Sangeet Natak Akademi from December 1998 to December 2003.   Hazarika, who made fame as a musician, was born on 8 September 1926 to Nilakanta and Shantipriya Hazarika in Sadiya ( \u09b6\u09a6\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09be ), Assam. His father was originally from Nazira, a town located in Sivasagar district. The eldest of ten children, Bhupen Hazarika (as also his siblings) was exposed to the musical influence of his mother, who exposed him to lullabies and traditional Music of Assam. His father moved to the Bharalumukh region of Guwahati in 1929, in search of better prospects, where Bhupen Hazarika spent his early childhood. In 1932 his father further moved to Dhubri, and in 1935 to Tezpur. It was in Tezpur that Bhupen Hazarika, then 10 years of age, was discovered by Jyotiprasad Agarwala, the noted Assamese lyricist, playwright and the first Assames Filmmaker and Bishnu Prasad Rabha, renowned Assamese artist and revolutionary poet, where he sang a Borgeet (the traditional classical Assamese devotional songs written by Srimanta Sankardeva and Sri Sri Madhabdeva), taught by his mother at a public function. In 1936, Bhupen Hazarika accompanied them to Kolkata where he recorded his first song at the Aurora Studio for the Selona Company. His association with the icons of Assamese Culture at Tezpur was the beginning of his artistic growth and credentials. Subsequently, Hazarika sang two songs in Agarwala's film Indramalati (1939): Kaxote Kolosi Loi and Biswo Bijoyi Naujawan at the age of 12. He wrote his first song, Agnijugor Firingoti Moi at the age of 13 and he was well on his way to becoming a lyricist, composer and singer. He studied at Sonaram High School at Guwahati, Dhubri Government High School and matriculated from Tezpur High School in 1940. He completed his Intermediate Arts from Cotton College in 1942, and his BA (1944) and MA (1946) in Political Science from Banaras Hindu University. For a brief period he worked at All India Radio, Guwahati when he won a scholarship from Columbia University and set sail for New York in 1949. There he earned a PhD (1952) on his thesis \"Proposals for Preparing India's Basic Education to use Audio-Visual Techniques in Adult Education\". In New York Bhupen Hazarika befriended Paul Robeson, a prominent civil rights activist, who influenced him in his song Bistirno parore which is based on the imagery and theme of Robeson's Ol' Man River. This song is translated in various Indian languages, including Bengali and Hindi and sung by the artist himself, and is still popular. Being inspired from some other foreign ones, he also composed several other songs in Indian languages. He was exposed to the Spiritual, and the multi-lingual version of We are in the Same Boat Brother became a regular feature in his stage performance. At Columbia University, he met Priyamvada Patel, whom he married in 1950. Tez Hazarika, their only child, was born in 1952, and he returned to India in 1953. His famous songs include (in Assamese): Hazarika began close association with the leftist Indian People's Theatre Association soon after returning from the USA in 1953 and became the Secretary of the Reception Committee of the Third All Assam Conference of IPTA, held in Guwahati in 1955.

BHUPEN HAZARIKA: envisioning education for India\", edited by Tej Hazarika and published by Cool Grove Press will be available in the US in days. Soon after completing his education, he became a teacher at the Gauhati University. But after a few years, he left the job and went to Kolkata where he established himself as a successful music director and singer. During that period, Hazarika made several award-winning Assamese films such as Shakuntala, Pratidhwani, etc. and composed evergreen music for many Assamese films. He was also considered as a new trend setter in Bengali music. The famous musical genre of West Bengal, the Jivanmukhi geet started by Kabir Suman in 1990's is thought to be influenced by Hazarika. Bhupen Hazarika composed music for films from Bangladesh too which got international acclaim. He was elected the President of the Asam Sahitya Sabha in 1993. In 1967, Hazarika got elected as a member of Assam Assembly from Nauboicha constituency.

Her first feature film Ek Pal with music score by Dr Bhupen Hazarika was produced by Dr Hazarika's childhood friend and India's top tea planter Hemendra Prasad Barooah, (' at the Internet Movie Database) (1986). Subsequently, Lajmi began assisting him professionally and personally till the end of his life. In the period after the release of Ek Pal (1986) until his death, Bhupen Hazarika mainly concentrated on Hindi films, most of which were directed by Kalpana Lajmi. Ek Pal (1986), Rudaali (1993) and Daman: A Victim of Marital Violence (2001) are major films this period. Many of his earlier songs were re-written in Hindi and used as played-back songs in these films. These songs tried to cater to the Hindi film milieu and their social activist lyrics were browbeaten into the lowest common denominator. He served as an MLA (Independent) during 1967-72 in the Assam Legislative Assembly from Nauboicha Constituency. He contested as a Bharatiya Janata Party candidate in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections from the Guwahati constituency, persuaded by Chandan Mitra via Kalpana Lajmi which he lost to the Indian National Congress candidate Kirip Chaliha.

His body lay in state at Judges Field in Guwahati and cremated on 9 November 2011 near the Brahmaputra river in a plot of land donated by Gauhati University. His funeral was attended by an estimated half a million people. As a singer, Hazarika was known for his baritone voice and diction; as a lyricist, he was known for poetic compositions and parables which touched on themes ranging from romance to social and political commentary; and as a composer, for his use of folk music. In a poll conducted in Bangladesh, his song, Manush Manusher Jonno (Humans are for humanity)' was chosen to be the second most favourite number after the National anthem of Bangladesh. Some of his most famous compositions were adaptations of American Black Spiritual that he had learned from Paul Robeson, whom he had befriended during his years in New York City in the early 1950s. His famous song \"Bistirno Parore\" is heavily influenced by Ol' Man River sung by Paul Robeson. During his lifetime, a full length docu-feature biopic film on his life titled Moi Eti Zazabor('I am a Wanderer') jointly directed by Late Waesqurni Bora and Arnab Jan Deka was launched in 1986 at his Nizarapar residence in Guwahati city. Music for this biopic film has been scored by 5-time International Best Music Awards winner only Assamese musician, songwriter, composer and singer Jim Ankan Deka, who also worked as Chief Assistant Director of this film. During the next two decades, the joint directors Late Bora and Deka shot him live for the film during his various public performances all over India, as well as many private moments in his domestic and social life. Arnab Jan Deka also extensively interviewed him regarding his life and its creative aspects for the film, which had been recorded during their joint travel to different metropolises and remote corners of Assam and rest of India. The film has been under production since 1986 with film negative footage of more than 16 hours currently preserved in different film laboratories in Bombay(Mumbai), Calcutta(Kolkata) and Madras(Chennai). The film was targeted for public release during the lifetime of Dr Bhupen Hazarika in 2008. But, the production was halted after sudden demise of one of the Co-Directors Waesqurni Bora in November 2008. Eventually, after the death of Dr Hazarika, the film's subject, the surviving Co-Director Arnab Jan Deka is currently carrying out necessary works to finish the film at the earliest and release for public consumption in several language versions including English, Assamese, Bengali and Hindi, with support from Late Waesqurni Bora's widowed wife Nazma Begum and Dr Hazarika's bereaved family members including his wife Priyam Hazarika and Tej Hazarika. Meanwhile, two books describing the unforgettable experiences of the making of this milestone biopic film had been authored by its co-director Arnab Jan Deka titled Anya Ek Zazabor and Mor Sinaki Bhupenda, first of which had been officially released in February 1993 by Late G P Sippy, then President of Film Federation of India and producer of world-record holder Hindi film Sholay at a public function organised by Dr Bhupen Hazarika himself."

        "biography": " Geeta Dutt (born Geet\u0101 Ghosh Roy Chowdhuri; 23 November 1930 \u2013 20 July 1972) was a prominent Indian singer, born in Faridpur before the Partition of India. She found particular prominence as a playback singer in Hindi cinema. She also sang many modern Bengali songs, both in film and non-film genre.   Geeta Ghosh Roy Chowdhuri was one of 10 children born to a wealthy Zamindar family in a village named Idilpur, presently under Gosairhat Upzilla of Shariatpur District, Bangladesh, formerly under Faridpur district in Bengal, British India. Her family moved to Calcutta and Assam in the early forties, leaving behind their land and properties. In 1942, her parents moved to an apartment in Bombay. Geeta was twelve and continued her schooling at the Bengali High School. K. Hanuman Prasad took Geeta under his patronage, trained and groomed her in singing and later launched her into singing for movies. In 1946, she got the first break with an opportunity to sing in the mythological film Bhakta Prahlad for which Prasad was the music director. She was given only two lines to sing for a few songs. In 1947, she got her break with Do Bhai. The music of Do Bhai became a hit with \"Mera sundar sapna beet gaya\" topping the charts. Geeta Roy's fresh and melodious voice combined vivacity and pathos in such a way that, despite a pronounced \"Bengali lilt,\" the song touched the pulse of thousands of music lovers. She was popularly nick-named \"Bangal ka jadu\" (the magic from Bengal). In the same film she sang the evocative \"Yaad karoge, yaad karoge, ik din humko yaad karoge.\" It was remarkable for a teenager to sing with such maturity. In the same year, she sang for Hunuman Prasad's other releases. The uncanny ability of Geeta Dutt that made her race past her contemporaries was her unique versatility to sing any kind of song with the authentic tone, feeling, passion and emotion as demanded by the composition and the situation it was being picturised in. From a bhajan to a club song, from a haunting melancholic song to a peppy romantic number, she could traverse the range of music, seemingly effortlessly. This unique versatility helped Geeta (Roy) Dutt carve out a niche and cement her place even when the Lata Mangeshkar phenomenon was sweeping through the world of Hindi playback, following the runaway success of Aayega Aanewala in Mahal (1949). Geeta Dutt's chart-busting \"Tadbeer se bigdi hui taqdeer bana le\" in Guru Dutt's directorial debut Baazi (1951) was the turning point where \"Geeta Roy's vivacity was matched every inch by Geeta Bali on-screen\". S. D. Burman had turned a ghazal by Sahir Ludhianvi into a sensual club song much to the chagrin of the famed lyricist-poet: The ploy worked as Baazi proved a hit on the strength of that song alone. S D Burman fully exploited Geeta's potential across the spectrum. \"Aan milo shyam saanware\" (Devdas, 1955), the duet with Manna Dey, has the unmistakable touch of the Baul folk music of Bengal. \"Nanhi kali sone chali\" (Sujata, 1959) is one of the most popular and heart-touching lullaby ever where Geeta Dutt's voice rings maternal love in every note. The bubbly exuberance of \"Aye dil mujhe bata de\" (Bhai Bhai, 1956) is in sharp contrast to the pathos of \"Waqt ne kiya\" in (Kaagaz Ke Phool, 1959). During Geeta's recording of songs for the movie Baazi, she met its young up-and-coming director, Guru Dutt. Their romance culminated in marriage on 26 May 1953. Geeta and Guru Dutt had three children: Tarun (1954-1985), Arun (1956-2014) and Nin\u0101 (b. 1962).[citation needed] With music directors Hemant Mukherjee (better known as Hemant Kumar in Bombay film industry) (Harano Sur, Sonar Harin) and Nachiketa Ghosh (Prithibi Amare Chaaye, 1957 and Indrani, 1958), Geeta Dutt came up with songs that were hauntingly melodious, youthful and heartwarming. At a time when Sandhya Mukherjee's voice was synonymous with Suchitra Sen, Hemant Mukherjee and Nachiketa Ghosh picked Geeta Dutt. She also cut a number Non-film discs, singing to the tune of notable music directors like Sudhin Dasgupta and Anal Chatterjee. In 1958, S.D. Burman had developed discord with Lata Mangeshkar as a playback singer and he attempted to work with Geeta as the main singer of his compositions rather than the upcoming Asha Bhosle who, he felt, was relatively raw. However, out of her personal problems, Geeta would not practice her art sufficiently and failed to meet Burman's demanding standards. (He and O.P. Nayyar then started to work with Asha and helped her blossom as a singer.) Guru Dutt's magnum opus Kaagaz Ke Phool came in 1959 in which Guru Dutt himself starred in the lead role with Waheeda Rehman. The film was in a way reflective of his own views on life and the transitory nature of fame and success in the film world. Geeta Dutt came up with one of her best renditions in the heart-rending \"Waqt ne kiya kya haseen sitam,\" composed by S. D. Burman and penned by Kaifi Azmi where she poured out her pain, anguish and pathos in every word. However, the box-office disaster of Kaagaz Ke Phool (which is now considered a classic) left them shattered, financially and emotionally. In 1964, Guru Dutt died from a combination of alcohol and an overdose of sleeping pills. (His death was widely perceived as a suicide following two earlier attempts.) Geeta then suffered a serious nervous breakdown and ran into financial problems. She tried to resume her singing career, cutting discs at Durg\u0101 Puj\u0101 and giving stage shows. She performed in a leading role in a Bengali movie, Badhu Baran (1967), and sang admirably Anubhav (1971), which was her final performance to the music of Kanu Roy as she died of liver cirrhosis in 1972, at the age of 41. Geeta died of cirrhosis of the liver on 20 July 1972 in Mumbai. Further information: List of songs recorded by Geeta Dutt She is supposed to have sung over 1200 songs in Hindi films. In addition, she has sung songs in many Indian regional languages including Marathi, Bengali, Maithili, Bhojpuri and Punjabi. She has sung in Nepali evergreen movie Maitighar. Some of the songs sung under S. D. Burman's direction: Some of the songs she sang under O. P.

Gulzar was born in a Kalra Sikh family, to Makhan Singh Kalra and Sujan Kaur, in Dina, Jhelum District, British India (now in Pakistan). Before becoming a writer, Sampooran took up lot of small jobs in Mumbai one of them was in a garage where he used to touch up accident cars by creating shades of paint, in his own words \"I had a knack for colors\". His father rebuked him for being writer initially. He took the pen name Gulzar Deenvi and later simply Gulzar.  Gulzar began his career under the film directors Bimal Roy and Hrishikesh Mukherjee. His book Ravi Paar has a narrative of Bimal Roy and the agony of creation. He started his career as a songwriter with the music director Sachin Dev Burman for the movie Bandini (1963). Shailendra who has penned rest of the songs of the movie requested Gulzar to write the song \"Mora Gora Ang Layle\", sung by Lata Mangeshkar. Directed and produced by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, the 1968 film Aashirwad had dialogues and lyrics written by Gulzar. Song lyrics and poems written by Gulzar gave the poetic attribute and the \"much-needed additional dimension\" to Ashok Kumar's role in the film. Ashok Kumar received the Best Actor at the Filmfare and at the National Film Awards for this role. Gulzar's lyrics however did not gain much attention until the 1969's Khamoshi, where his song \"Humne Dekhi Hai Un Aankhon Ki Mehekti Khushboo\" (lit., \"I have seen the fragrance of those eyes\") became popular. Ganesh Anantharaman in his book Bollywood Melodies describes Gulzar's lyrics, with the purposeful mixing of the senses, to be \"daringly defiant\".[a] For the 1971 film Guddi, he penned two songs of which \"Humko Man Ki Shakti Dena\" was a prayer which is still sung in many schools in India. As a lyricist, Gulzar had close association with the music director Rahul Dev Burman. He has also worked with Sachin Dev Burman, Shankar Jaikishan, Hemant Kumar, Laxmikant-Pyarelal, Madan Mohan, Rajesh Roshan, and Anu Malik. Gulzar worked with Salil Chowdhury (Anand (1971), Mere Apne (1971)), Madan Mohan (Mausam (1975)) and more recently with Vishal Bhardwaj (Maachis (1996), Omkara (2006), Kaminey (2009)), A. R.

Another Ratnam-Rahman hit, \"Chaiyya Chaiyya\" from Dil Se.. also had lyrics written by Gulzar, based on the Sufi folk song \"Thaiyya Thaiyya\" with lyrics by poet Bulleh Shah. For another collaboration with Rahman for Danny Boyle's 2007 Hollywood film Slumdog Millionaire, Rahman and Gulzar won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Jai Ho\" at the 81st Academy Awards.

His next film Khushboo was based on Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay's Pandit Mashay. His Mausam which won National Award for 2nd Best Feature Film, Filmfare Best Movie and Filmfare Best Director awards, along with other six Filmfare nominations, was loosely based on the story \"Weather\", from the novel, The Judas Tree, by A.J. Cronin. His 1982's film Angoor was based on Shakespeare's play The Comedy of Errors. In 1988, Gulzar directed an eponymous television serial Mirza Ghalib starring Naseeruddin Shah and broadcast on Doordarshan. Later he also directed Tahreer Munshi Premchand Ki about the novels of Premchand. None of the Gulzar's film were very commercially successful. His films told stories of human relationships entangled in social issues. Libaas was a story of extra-marital affair of an urban couple. Due to its objectionable subject the film never got released in India. Mausam pictured a story of a father who tries to improve the life of his prostitute-daughter.

He was also a renowned film lyricist in Hindi films, where he won the Filmfare Awards for Best Lyricist twice.   Jaipuri was born Iqbal Husain in Jaipur, where he studied English till medium level, and then acquired his taalim in Urdu and Persian from his paternal grandfather, Fida Husain. He began writing verse, when he was around twenty years old. Around same time, he fell in love with a Hindu girl named Radha. In 1940, Jaipuri came to Bombay (now Mumbai), and started working as a bus conductor, earning a monthly salary of eleven rupees. He used to participate in mushairas. At a mushaira, Prithviraj Kapoor noticed Jaipuri and recommended him to his son, Raj Kapoor. Raj Kapoor was planning a musical love story, Barsaat (1949) with Shankar-Jaikishan. Jaipuri wrote his first recorded song, Jiya Beqaraar Hai for the film. His second song (and first duet) was Chhor Gaye Baalam. Along with Shailendra, Jaipuri wrote lyrics for all Raj Kapoor films till 1971. After the death of Jaikishan and failures of Mera Naam Joker and Kal Aaj Aur Kal, however, Raj Kapoor turned to other lyricists and music directors. Kapoor initially wanted to call him back for Prem Rog, but later settled for another lyricist, Amir Qazalbash. Kapoor finally asked him to write lyrics for the film, Ram Teri Ganga Maili. Later, he also invited him to write three songs for the movie Henna. Jaipuri alleges that after Raj Kapoor's death, the music composer Ravindra Jain \"conspired\" to \"scrap\" his lyrics and replace them with his own lyrics. When fellow lyricist Shailendra turned producer with Teesri Kasam, he invited Jaipuri to write lyrics for the movie. He also wrote screenplay for the movie Hulchul (1951). His last film as a lyricist was Hatya: The Murder (2004). Jaipuri has written several books of poetry, in Hindi and Urdu. He once said, \"Hindi and Urdu are like two great and inseparable sisters\". Jaipuri invested his earnings in property, on his wife's advice. Thanks to earnings from these properties, his financial condition was sound, and therefore he was not much active as a lyricist. He was survived by two sons and a daughter live in Mumbai"

        "biography": " Hemanta Mukherjee, often credited as Hemant Kumar (16 June 1920 \u2013 26 September 1989), was an Indian playback singer, music director and film producer, who sang in Bengali, Hindi and other Indian languages. He is also the greatest artiste of Rabindra Sangeet. He won two National awards for the category best male playback singer. He is often credited as one of the greatest Indian singers of all time for his unparalleled manly voice.   Hemanta was born in the city of Varanasi, India. His family originated from Baharu village in West Bengal. They migrated to Kolkata in the early 1900s. Hemanta grew up there and attended Nasiruddin School and later Mitra Institution school of Bhawanipore area. There he met his longtime friend Subhas Mukhopadhyay who later became a Bengali poet. During this time, he developed a friendship with the noted writer Santosh Kumar Ghosh. At that time, Hemanta wrote short stories, Santosh Kumar wrote poems and Subhash Mukhopadhyay sang songs.[citation needed] After passing the intermediate examinations (12th grade), Hemanta joined Bengal Technical Institute at Jadavpur to pursue Engineering. However, he quit academics to pursue a career in music, despite parental objection. He briefly tried literature and published a short story in a prestigious Bengali magazine called Desh, but by the late-1930s he was committed entirely to music.[citation needed] Under the influence of his friend Subhas Mukhopadhyay, Hemanta recorded his first song for All India Radio in 1935. The first line of the song was \"Amar Ganete Ele Nabarupi Chirantanii.\" Hemanta's music career was primarily mentored by the Bengali musician, Sailesh Duttagupta. In his early life Hemanta used to follow the famous Bengali singer Pankaj Mullick. For this he was nicknamed as \"Chhoto Pankaj\".In an interview on television in the early 1980s, Hemanta had mentioned that he had also received classical music training from Ustad Faiyaz Khan's student Phanibhusan Banerjee, but his tutelage was cut short by Ustad's untimely death. In 1937, Hemanta cut his first gramophone disc under the Columbia label. The songs (non-film) on this disc were \"Janite Jadi Go Tumi\" and \"Balo Go Balo More\" whose lyrics were by Naresh Bhattacharya and music was composed by Sailesh Duttagupta. Thereafter, every year Hemanta continued to record non-film discs for the Gramophone Company of India (GCI) till 1984. His first Hindi songs were \"Kitana Dukh Bhulaya Tumne\" and \"O Preet Nibhanewali\", released in 1940 under GCI's Columbia label. Music for these songs were composed by Kamal Dasgupta; lyrics were by Faiyaz Hashmi. Hemanta's first film song was in the Bengali film Nimai Sanyas released in 1941. Music was scored by Hariprasanna Das. Hemanta's first compositions for himself were the Bengali non-film songs \"Katha Kayonako Shudhu Shono\" and \"Amar Biraha Akashe Priya\" in 1944. Lyrics were by Amiya Bagchi. His first Hindi film songs were in Irada (1944 film) in 1944 under Pt. Amarnath's music direction. Hemanta is considered a foremost exponent of Rabindra Sangeet. His first recorded Rabindra Sangeet was in the Bengali film Priya Bandhabi (1944). The song was \"Pather Sesh Kothaye\". He recorded his first non-film Rabindra Sangeet disc in 1944 under the Columbia label. The songs were \"Aamar Aar Habe Na Deri\" and \"Keno Pantha E Chanchalata\". His first movie as a music director was the Bengali film Abhiyatri in 1947. Although many of the songs Hemanta recorded during this time received critical acclaim, major commercial success eluded him until 1947. Some contemporary male singers of Hemanta in Bengali were Jaganmay Mitra, Robin Majumdar, Satya Chowdhury, Dhananjay Bhattacharya, Sudhirlal Chakraborty, Bechu Dutta and Talat Mahmood. Hemanta had three brothers and a sister, Nilima. His elder brother, Tarajyoti, was a short-story writer in Bengali. The youngest brother, Amal Mukherjee, composed music for some Bengali movies, most notably Hospital and Abak Prithibi. He recorded a few Bengali songs in the 1960s. In 1945, Hemanta married Bela Mukherjee (died 25 June 2009), a singer from Bengal. Although Bela had sung some popular songs in a TV =newsfeed&oq newsfeed&oq newsfeed&oq newsfeed&oq movie, Kashinath (1943), with music by Pankaj Mullick, she did not actively pursue her musical career after marriage. They had two children: a son, Jayant, and a daughter, Ranu. Ranu as Ranu Mukhopadhyay pursued a music career in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with somewhat limited success. Jayant is married to Moushumi Chatterjee, an Indian film actress who was popular in the 1970s. In the mid-1940s, Hemanta became an active member of the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA) and started an association with another active IPTA member \u2014 songwriter and composer Salil Chowdhury. One of the main driving forces behind the establishment of IPTA was the Bengal famine of 1943 and the inaction of the British administration and wealthy Indians to prevent it. In 1947, Hemanta recorded a non-film song called \"Ganyer badhu\" (\"The rural bride\") that had music and lyrics by Salil Chowdhury. The six-minute song recorded on two sides of a 78 rpm disc was sung at a varying pace and lacked the conventional structure and romantic theme of a Bengali song. It depicted an idyllic, prosperous and caring rural woman's life and family and how it gets ravaged by the demons of famine and ensuing poverty. This song generated an unforeseen popularity for Hemanta and Salil in eastern India and, in a way, established Hemanta ahead of his male contemporaries. Hemanta and Salil paired again in several songs over the next few years. Almost all these songs proved to be very popular. Around the same period, Hemanta started receiving more assignments for music composition for Bengali films. Some were for directorHemen Gupta. When Hemen moved to Mumbai a few years later, he called upon Hemanta to compose music for his first directorial venture in Hindi titled Anandmath under the Filmistan banner. Responding to this call, Hemanta migrated to Mumbai in 1951 and joined Filmistan Studios. The music of Anand Math (1952) was a moderate success. Perhaps, the most notable songs from this movie is 'Vande mataram' sung by Lata Mangeshkar, which Hemanta set to a marching tune. Following Anandamath, Hemanta scored music for a few Filmistan movies like Shart in subsequent years, the songs of which received moderate popularity. Simultaneously, Hemanta gained popularity in Mumbai as a playback singer. His songs playbacked for actor Dev Anand under music director Sachin Dev Burman in movies like Jaal, House No. 44, Solva Saal and Baat ek raat ki became quite popular. By the mid-1950s, Hemanta had consolidated his position as a prominent singer and composer. In Bengal, he was one of the foremost exponents of Rabindra Sangeet and perhaps the most sought-after male singer. In a ceremony organised by Hemanta Mukherjee to honour Debabrata Biswas (1911\u20131980), the legendary Rabindra Sangeet exponent, in Calcutta in March 1980, Debabrata Biswas unhesitatingly mentioned Hemanta as \"the second hero\" to popularise Rabindra Sangeet, the first being the legendary Pankaj Kumar Mallick. In Mumbai, along with playback singing, Hemanta carved a niche as a composer. He composed music for a Hindi film called Nagin (1954) which became a major success owing largely to its music. Songs of Nagin remained chart-toppers continuously for two years and culminated in Hemant receiving the prestigious Filmfare Best Music Director Award in 1955. The very same year, he scored music for a Bengali movie called Shapmochan in which he played back four songs for the Bengali actor Uttam Kumar. This started a long partnership between Hemant and Uttam as a playback singer-actor pair. They were the most popular singer-actor duo in Bengali cinema over the next decade. In the latter part of the 1950s, Hemanta composed music and sang for several Bengali and Hindi films, recorded several Rabindra Sangeets and Bengali non-film songs. Almost all of these, especially his Bengali songs, became very popular. This period can be seen as the zenith of his career and lasted for almost a decade. He sang songs composed by the major music directors in Bengal such as Nachiketa Ghosh, Robin Chatterjee and Salil Chowdhury. Some of the notable films Hemanta himself composed music for during this period include Harano Sur, Marutirtha Hinglaj, Neel Akasher Neechey, Lukochuri, Swaralipi, Deep Jwele Jaai, Shesh Parjanta, Kuhak, Dui Bhai, and Saptapadi in Bengali, and, Jagriti and Ek Hi Raasta in Hindi. In the late 1950s, Hemanta ventured into movie production under his own banner: Hemanta-Bela productions. The first movie under this banner was a Bengali film directed by Mrinal Sen, titled Neel Akasher Neechey (1959). The story was based on the travails of a Chinese street hawker in Calcutta in the backdrop of India's freedom struggle. The movie went on to win the President's Gold Medal \u2014 the highest honour for a movie from Government of India. In the next decade, Hemanta's production company was renamed Geetanjali productions and it produced several Hindi movies such as Bees Saal Baad, Kohraa, Biwi Aur Makaan, Faraar, Rahgir and Khamoshi \u2014 all of which had music by Hemanta. Only Bees Saal Baad and Khamoshi were major commercial successes. Back in Bengal, Hemanta scored music for a movie titled Palatak in 1963 where he experimented with merging Bengal folk music and light music. This proved to be a major success and Hemanta's composition style changed noticeably for many of his future films in Bengal such as Baghini, and Balika Badhu. In Bengali films Manihar and Adwitiya, both of which were major musical as well as commercial successes, his compositions had a light classical tinge. In 1961, for commemorating Rabindranath Tagore's birth centenary, Gramophone company of India featured Rabindrasangeet by Hemanta in a large portion of its commemorative output. This too proved to be a major commercial success. Hemanta went on several overseas concert tours including his trip to the West Indies. Overall, in the 1960s decade he retained his position as the major male singer in Bengal and as a composer and singer to be reckoned with in Hindi films. In the 1960s he was the predominant and lead male voice in many of Tagore's musical dramas like Valmiki Pratibha, Shyama, Sapmochan, Chitrangada and Chandalika. With Kanika Bandopadhyay (1924\u20132000) and Suchitra Mitra (1924\u20132010), who were the lead female voices in these, he was part of the Rabindra Sangeet triumvirate that was popular and respected. It was referred as 'Hemanta-Kanika-Suchitra' and, with Debabrata Biswas, this quartet was and continues to be most heard exponents of Tagore compositions.Along with Hemanta Mukhopadhyay, Debabrata Biswas, Kanika Bandopadhyay and Suchitra Mitra, Chinmoy Chattopadhyay, Sagar Sen and Sumitra Sen were the other leading exponents of Rabindra Sangeet at that time. In the 1970s, Hemanta's contribution in Hindi films was nominal. He scored music for a handful of his home productions, but none of these movies were successful nor their music. In Bengal, however, he remained the foremost exponent of Rabindra Sangeet, film and non-film songs. His output continued to be popular for most of the decade. Some of them are Jodi jante chao tumi (1972), Sedin tomay dekhechilam (1974), Khirki theke singho duar (stree 1971), Ke jane ko ghonta (1974)and popularise Rabindra sangeet using beautifully in films as per situations. A classic example is the song 'Chorono dhorite diyogo amare ' in 'Dadar Kirti'(1980). In 1971, Hemanta debuted as a film director in for his self-produced Bengali movie Anindita. It didn't fare exceedingly well at the box office. However, his rendition 'Diner seshe ghumer deshe' was one of his best Rabindra Sangeet. In the same year Hemanta went to Hollywood by responding famous film director Conrad Rooks and score the music of Conrad's Siddhartha and played back in that film. He was the first Indian singer to play back in Hollywood. The US government honoured Hemanta by giving him citizenship of Baltimore, Maryland. Hemanta is also the first ever singer of India to get USA citizenship. In the early to mid-1970s, two major music composers in Bengal, Nachiketa Ghosh and Robin Chatterjee, who had worked closely with Hemanta since the early 1950s, died. Simultaneously, music composed by Hemanta for Bengali films like Fuleswari, Raag Anurag, \" Ganadebata \" and Dadar Kirti established Hemanta as the major film music composer in the Bengal movie scene. In 1979, Hemanta re-recorded some of his earlier works with composer Salil Chowdhury from the 1940s and 1950s. This album, titled Legend of Glory, vol. 2 was a major commercial success, despite Hemanta's aged and slightly tired voice. In 1980, Hemanta had a heart attack that severely affected his vocal capabilities, especially his breath control. He continued to record songs in the early eighties, but his voice was a shade of its rich baritone past. In 1984, Hemanta was felicitated by different organizations, most notably by the Gramophone Company of India, for completing 50 years in music. That very year Hemanta released his last album with Gramophone Company of India \u2014 a 45 rpm extended play disc with four non-film songs. Over the next few years, Hemanta released non-film songs under small-time labels that had cropped up in the nascent cassette-based music industry. Only a few of these were commercially successful. He composed music for a handful of Bengali movies and one Bengali and one Hindi tele-series. However, by this time he had become an institution, a beloved personality, and a courteous and friendly gentleman. His philanthropic activities included running a homeopathic hospital in memory of his late father in their native village in Baharu, in the South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. In a television interview to noted elocutionist Gauri Ghosh, his wife Bela Mukherjee recalled that she never knew during his lifetime the number of families and persons he helped to put up financially or otherwise; only after he died that this truth gradually unveiled. He continued to feature regularly on All India Radio, Doordarshan (TV) and live programmes/concerts during this period. In 1987, he was nominated for Padmabhushan which he refused politely, having already turned down the offer to receive Padmashree in the 1970s. In this year, he was publicly felicitated in Netaji Indoor Stadium in Calcutta for completing 50 years in musical journey, where, Lata Mangeshkar presented him with the memento on behalf of his fans and admirers.Despite his ageing voice, he became the Best Male Singer in 1988 for his rendition in the film \"Lalan Fakir\". In September 1989 he travelled to Dhaka, Bangladesh to receive the Michael Madhusudan Award, as well as to perform a concert. Immediately after returning from this trip he suffered another heart attack on 26 September and died at 11:15 pm in a nursing home in South Calcutta. Nearly two decades after his death the Gramophone Company of India releases at least one album by Hemanta Mukhopadhyay every year, repackaging his older songs, because of the commercial viability of his songs. His legacy still lives on through the songs he has recorded, music he has composed, and through many male singers in Bengal and the rest of India who continue to imitate his singing style. Total number of films: 138 Hemant Kumar also sang several Marathi songs, notably \"Mee Dolkara, Dolkara, Dolakra dariyacha raaja....\" (\u092e\u0940 \u0921\u094b\u0932\u0915\u0930, \u0921\u094b\u0932\u0915\u0930 \u0926\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u091a\u093e \u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e) with Lata Mangeshkar. This song became immensely popular. Another popular Marathi song by Hemant Kumar, \"Gomu sangatina mazya tu yeshil kay\" (\u0917\u094b\u092e\u0942 \u0938\u0902\u0917\u0924\u0940\u0928\u0902 \u092e\u093e\u091d\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0924\u0942 \u092f\u0947\u0936\u0940\u0932 \u0915\u093e\u092f), is filmed on the famous actor Kashinath Ghanekar in the film Ha Khel Saavalyancha (\u0939\u093e \u0916\u0947\u0933 \u0938\u093e\u0935\u0932\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0902\u091a\u093e). One Marathi song sung by Hemant Da is \"Preetichya Chandraati\". One more Koli Geet is \"Daryawari re tarali hori re\" with singer Shyama chittar. He composed music for a Marathi film Naikinicha Sajja (1957). Apart from Marathi songs, Hemant Kumar sang in several other languages like Gujarati, Assamese, Oriya, Konkani and Bhojpuri."

        "artist_name": "Jagjit_Singh", 
        "biography": " Jagjit Singh, born Jagmohan Singh Dhiman (8 February 1941\u00a0\u2013 10 October 2011), was an iconic Indian Ghazal singer, composer and musician. Known as the \"Ghazal King\", he gained acclaim together with his wife, another renowned Indian ghazal singer Chitra Singh in the 1970s and 1980s. Their combination album comprising music from the films, Arth and Saath Saath is the HMV's largest selling combination album of all time.[citation needed] Sajda (An Offering, 1991), Jagjit Singh's magnum opus double album with Lata Mangeshkar holds the same record in non-film category.[citation needed] He sang in numerous languages. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the government of India in 2003. In February 2014, Government of India released a postal stamp in his honour. Singh is credited for the revival and popularity of ghazal, an Indian classical art form, by choosing poetry that was relevant to the masses and composing them in a way that laid more emphasis on the meaning of words and melody evoked by them. In terms of Indian Classical music, his style of composing and Gayaki (singing) is considered as Bol-pradhan, one that lays emphasis on words. He highlighted this in his music for films such as Prem Geet (1981), Arth and Saath Saath (1982), and TV serials Mirza Ghalib (1988) and Kahkashan (1991). Jagjit Singh is considered to be the most successful ghazal singer and composer of all time in terms of critical acclaim and commercial success. With a career spanning five decades and a repertoire comprising over 90 albums, the range and breadth of his work has been regarded as genre-defining. He is the only composer and singer to have composed and recorded songs written by former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u00a0\u2013 also a poet\u00a0\u2013 in two albums, Nayi Disha (1999) and Samvedna (2002).[citation needed] Singh's 1987 album, Beyond Time, was the first digitally recorded release in India. He was regarded as one of India's most influential artists. With sitar legend Ravi Shankar and other leading figures of Indian classical music and literature, Singh voiced his concerns over politicisation of arts and culture in India and lack of support experienced by the practitioners of India's traditional art forms, particularly folk artists and musicians. He lent active support to several philanthropic endeavours such as the library at St. Mary's School, Mumbai, Bombay Hospital, CRY, Save the Children and ALMA.   Jagjit Singh was born in Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan, India (then Bikaner State) in a Punjabi Sikh family. His father was Amar Singh and his mother was Bachan Kaur. Educated initially at Khalsa High School and Government College in Sri Ganganagar, Singh obtained an arts degree from DAV College in Jalandhar. There he began his professional career in 1961 by undertaking singing and composing assignments at All India Radio's (AIR) Jalandhar station. Later, he studied to obtain a post-graduate degree in history from Kurukshetra University in Haryana. Throughout this time, and as a consequence of a natural talent that was spotted by his father, Singh learned music initially from a visually impaired master of Indian classical music, Pandit Chaganlal Sharma and later from Ustad Jamaal Khan of Senia Gharana, who taught and trained him in all the prominent styles of Hindustani Classical vocal tradition such as Khayal, Dhrupad, Thumri and others. Throughout his teenage years, he performed on stage and composed music. Although his father, who was a government employee, had hoped that he would become an engineer, Singh pursued his passion for music relentlessly. Like all parents in Indian middle-class families, his father aspired for him to become a bureaucrat. However, he also encouraged Singh and his siblings to learn music. In March 1965, and without the knowledge of his family, Singh moved to Bombay, where there were many opportunities for music artists because of the Bollywood film industry. He obtained work initially as a singer of advertising jingles and later progressed to playback singing. Singh was still struggling to make a living in 1967 when he met the Bengali-born Chitra Dutta. She divorced her husband and married Singh in December 1969. Following the birth of their son, Vivek, the couple performed as a singing duo but it was not until the 1976[clarification needed] release of the album The Unforgettable that they found significant, and surprising, success. In the interval, the primary difficulty for them had been that the ghazal music genre was dominated by Muslim artists and especially those from Pakistan. The Unforgettable, which was the couple's first LP, was an unconventional recording and it turned them into stars. The song \"Baat Niklegi\" from the album achieved great popularity for the Singhs. The Independent described it in 2011 as \"ground-breaking\u00a0... it became a transformative, before-and-after milestone in the history of Indian popular and ghazals music. It remains that.\" Using modern arrangements, it consists of ten tracks that include two on which they sang as a duo and the remainder equally split between Jagjit and Chitra singing the lead. The Independent further noted that \"This format of solo and duet performances from the first commercially successful husband-and-wife team in Indian popular music proved astonishingly successful.\" Jagjit explained that \"I was determined to polish up the genre and make it more acceptable to modern tastes, so chose simple poems and set them to simple tunes. I also introduced western instrumentation to make them livelier.\" Thereafter, the couple worked both on solo and joint musical projects and performed concerts worldwide. There was success from involvement with the film industry and they amassed considerable wealth, while Jagjit became known as \"the Ghazal king\". Among their subsequent duo recordings of the 1970s were Shiv Kumar Batalvi\u00a0\u2013 Birha da Sultan (1978), Live in Concert at Wembley (1979) and Come Alive (1979). Of those released in the 1980s, \"The Latest\" by Sudarshan Faakir was the best selling album with his life time hit \"Woh Kagaz ki Kashti...Woh Baarish ka Paani\". It was the first album by the duo with poetry of only one Poet. Ecstasies (1984) has also been described as \"one of their finest\". The joint projects ceased in 1990 when their 18-year-old son, Vivek, was killed in a road accident. Chitra felt unable to sing following these events. Monica, Chitra's daughter from her first marriage, committed suicide in 2009. Although Jagjit continued to work and to have success after Chitra withdrew from public life he, too, was affected by the death of Vivek. The Guardian notes that he \"suffered from deep depression and his anguish was often evident in his live performances.\" Aside from occupying himself with solo projects, which he performed in several languages, he collaborated with Lata Mangeshkar on an album titled Sajda, an Urdu word meaning \"prostration\". Singh's work in film encompassed playback singing for productions such as Arth, Saath Saath and Premgeet. He composed all of the songs for the latter, as well as for the TV serial Mirza Ghalib that was based on the life of the eponymous poet, Mirza Ghalib.[citation needed] On 10 May 2007, in the presence of numerous political and diplomatic luminaries at an event held in the Central Hall of the Parliament of India, Jagjit Singh rendered Bahadur Shah Zafar's famous ghazal Lagta nahin hai dil mera to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. In 1990, Vivek (Jagjit Singh and Chitra's son) died in a road accident at the age of 20. This came as a profound shock to Jagjit and Chitra Singh. They gave up music for a full year after the death. At the end of that period, Jagjit returned slowly to music, but Chitra announced her retirement and declared that she would not sing or record any more songs. Singh toured the UK in 2011 and was due to perform with Ghulam Ali in Mumbai but suffered a brain haemorrhage on 23 September 2011. He was in a coma for over two weeks and died on 10 October at Lilavati Hospital, in Mumbai. He was cremated the following day at Chandanwadi Crematorium near Marine Lines in Mumbai. A number of tributes have been paid to Singh after his death, and some tried to cash in on his popularity, which was criticised by his wife. A biography of Singh, entitled Beyond Time based on about 40 hours of interviews with him, was released in 2012. It was transcribed and edited by Ashrani Mathur. A biopic documentary by the name of Kaagaz Ki Kashti has been made on the life journey of Jagjit Singh, who broke through the norms and revolutionised the Ghazal scenario. The film traces the struggle and stardom in his musical career, the love & loss in his personal life and the scope and limitations in the music scenario of the times. The film directed by Brahmanand S Singh will be released soon."

        "artist_name": "Jatin\u2013Lalit", 
        "biography": " Jatin\u2013Lalit are a Bollywood film composer duo consisting of Jatin Pandit and his younger brother Lalit. They have written the scores for films such as Khiladi, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, Khamoshi: The Musical, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Yes Boss, Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Mohabbatein, Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham and Fanaa . Jatin\u2013Lalit is their professional name and appears on the covers of their music CDs and DVDs. In 2006, the brothers ended their professional relationship, citing personal problems. Jatin holds the record for most nominations at the Filmfare Awards without ever winning, with eleven. They all came in the Best Music Director category, in which the duo has received 11 nominations. Lalit has won the award for Dabangg(2010), along with Sajid-Wajid.   Jatin and Lalit are born into the Mewati gharana of Jodhpur in Rajasthan and are nephews of classical exponent Pandit Jasraj. They received their musical education primarily from their father, Pandit Pratap Narayan. They were taught guitar and piano by Pyarelal Ramprasad Sharma, of the Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo. Hindi film actresses Sulakshana Pandit and Vijeta Pandit are their sisters, and music director Aadesh Shrivastava was their brother-in-law, being married to the younger of the sisters, Vijeta. They began their career in 1991, composing music for the Hindi movie Yaara Dildara. Although the film was a flop, its music was a big hit. The evergeen famous song of the movie was \"Bin Tere Sanam\", which topped the charts. They were first noticed for their work on the soundtrack of the movie Khiladi and for \"Pehla Nasha\", a romantic song from Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander, the film which earned then their first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director. Their compositions are strongly influenced by R. D. Burman's style of music making. In 1994, they composed the successful soundtrack to the Shahrukh Khan starrer Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa. Jatin\u2013Lalit's score for the cult classic Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was a massive success, and is remembered as one of the all-time best Bollywood soundtracks, earning them another nomination at the Filmfares. Following this, their successful scores for Khamoshi: The Musical (1996) and Yes Boss (1997), which earned them their third and fourth nominations at the Filmfare Awards cemented their place as Bollywood's top music directors. Jatin\u2013Lalit's next big success came with Karan Johar's debut directorial, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, which sold 8.5 million copies and won a nomination for best music at the Filmfare Awards. Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha, in the same year, and Sarfarosh, in 1999 were also appreciated, earning them their fifth and sixth nominations at the Filmfare Awards. Mohabbatein, (2000) directed by Aditya Chopra won acclaim, and the song \"Humko Humise Chura Lo\" became a classic. This soundtrack was also nominated at the Filmfare Awards, as was Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001), another famous soundtrack which included songs like \"Bolein Chudiyan\". Before their split in 2006, some of their successful soundtracks include Hum Tum (2004), Chalte Chalte (2003) and Fanaa (2006), their final collaboration. The latter two movies won them their tenth and eleventh nominations at the Filmfare Awards. Despite being nominated eleven times, Jatin\u2013Lalit never won a Filmfare Award, and hold the record for the most nominations without ever winning. They have composed a total of 473 songs in 72 films.

Veteran singers Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhonsle & Jagjit Singh has also sung in few movies for the duo. Abhijeet credits Jatin\u2013Lalit with the success of his career, due to songs like \"Yeh Teri Aankhen Jhunki Jhunki\", \"Main Koi Aisa Geet Gaon\", \"Chaand Taare\", and \"Tauba Tumhare Yeh Ishare\". During the last few years of their joint career, their music albums contained several songs composed by other musicians. This practice was not liked by Jatin\u2013Lalit; however, the producer and director insisted on it.[citation needed] In Karan Johar's Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham two of the tracks were composed by Sandesh Shandilya. In Chalte Chalte, Aadesh Shrivastava composed several songs while in Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya, one song was composed by Himesh Reshammiya and Sajid-Wajid. They were among the first composers to write songs performed by Bollywood film stars rather than playback singers. They specially composed \"Aati Kya Khandala\" in the film Ghulam for the lead actor Aamir Khan. Later, They also composed a song for Sanjay Dutt to sing in the movie Khoobsurat. Jatin\u2013Lalit have composed the highest selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year on four occasions - Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge in 1995, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in 1998, Mohabbatein in 2000, and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham in 2001. Jatin and Lalit appeared in the movie Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar during the song \"Humse Hai Saara Jahaan\". Jatin is the guy singing the song with the girl whereas Lalit can be seen playing the guitar (the very first shot of the song). Jatin performed the song \"Rooth ke Humse\" in the film. Jatin\u2013Lalit are generally reclusive: they rarely attend industry parties or conduct interviews with the media.[citation needed] Jatin\u2013Lalit were appointed as judges in the Zee Television musical show Sa Re Ga Ma Pa. They were judges on another musical show, Star Voice of India. Jatin has appeared as a mentor in a popular TV show Jhoom India. He was judge and mentor in the popular reality show on Sony, Waar Pariwaar. This show was hosted by Urmila Matondkar and was appreciated by the Indian community all over the world especially in the USA. After working for almost 16 years together, they announced that they would be parting ways due to personal problems. Reasons for the separation are unknown, but entertainment writers have speculated that the split is because of financial matters and Lalit wanted to create original tracks than copying others. Lalit and Jatin have continued to compose separately. Lalit scored the 2007 film, Life Mein Kabhie Kabhiee, Showbiz, Horn Ok Pleassss and Dulha Mil Gaya. Jatin composed the score for Saurav Shukla's upcoming film, I am 24, starring Neha Dhupia and Rajat Kapoor. It is a Planman Motion Films Presentation.

        "artist_name": "Kalyanji\u2013Anandji", 
        "biography": " Kalyanji\u2013Anandji are an Indian composer duo from Gujarat: Kalyanji Virji Shah (30 June 1928-03 November 2000) and his brother Anandji Virji Shah (born 02 March 1933). The duo are known for their work on Hindi film soundtracks, particularly action potboilers in the 1970s. Some of their best-known works are Don, Bairaag, Saraswatichandra, Qurbani, Tridev and Safar. They won the 1975 Filmfare Award for Best Music Director for Kora Kagaz.   Kalyanji and Anandji were children of a businessman who migrated from Kutch to Bombay (now Mumbai) to start a grocery and provision store. The brothers began to learn music from a music teacher, who taught them in lieu of paying his bills to their father. One of their great-grandparents was a folk musician of some eminence. They spent most of their formative years in the Mumbai locality of Girgaum amidst Marathi and Gujarati environs and among some eminent musical talent that resided in the vicinity. Kalyanji started his career as a musician, with a new electronic instrument called the clavioline. which was used for the famous \"Nagin Been,\" used in the film Nagin (1954) which had the music of Hemant Kumar. Kalyanji then, with his brother Anandji, started an orchestral group called Kalyanji Virji and Party which organised musical shows in Mumbai and outside. This was the first attempt made for holding live musical shows in India. Kalyanji Anandji's arrival in the Bombay film industry as music composers was a turning point. When big music directors like S.D. Burman, Hemant Kumar, Madan Mohan, Naushad, Shankar Jaikishan and Ravi were ruling the Hindi film music world \u2013 and it was a golden period of film music \u2013 it was very tough to make a place amongst them. Still they came and won the hearts and minds of Indian people. The Bharat Bhushan\u2013Nirupa Roy hit Samrat Chandragupta (1959) was his first film as Kalyanji Virji Shah. Songs like \"Chahe Paas Ho\" (Lata\u2013Rafi) that are remembered to this day were what made the movie a commercial success. This was followed by his composing music scores for more films like Post Box 999 before Anandji who was assisting him, joined him officially to form the Kalyanji Anandji duo in Satta Bazar and Madari (1959). Chalia (1961) was their earliest major hit. In 1965, two decisive scores, Himalay Ki God Mein and Jab Jab Phool Khile, established them as composers to reckon with. Kalyanji\u2013Anandji's variety-studded music is complete with some of the topmost songs of all singers and genres. Both Kalyanji and Anandji worked as music composers for over 250 films, 17 of which were golden jubilees and 39 silver. The factor behind their success is hard work, apart from their talent. They were never self-centered or egoistic. The spiritually inclined brothers opened up a new horizon in Bollywood. They used to put society in front of them and, as a thankful gesture, organised many charitable concerts for NGOs and several charitable institutions in India and abroad with some of the biggest names in Bollywood, like Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Anil Kapoor, Vinod Khanna, Rekha and Sridevi. They were tireless in discovering new talents and grooming them, as well. Manhar Udhas, Kumar Sanu, Alka Yagnik, Sadhana Sargam, Sapna Mukherjee, Udit Narayan, Sunidhi Chauhan, now very popular names, were nurtured as singers and got their first breaks from Kalyanji Anandji.Laxmikant Pyarelal worked as music assistants to Kalyanji Anandji before composing Music independently for Hindi films . They helped introduce or gave career defining breaks to lyricists like Qamar Jalalabadi, Anand Bakshi, Gulshan Bawra, Anjaan, Verma Malik and M G Hashmat. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, their work was introduced to a young Western audience by three albums. Bombay the Hard Way: Guns, Cars and Sitars was a mix album put together by US DJ Dan The Automator; Bollywood Funk was an Outcaste compilation album put together by Sutrasonic DJs Harv and Sunni; while The Beginners Guide To Bollywood was compiled by John Lewis from Time Out magazine. All three of these records concentrated on Kalyanji Anandji tracks from 1970s films that featured funk breakbeats, wah-wah guitars and Motown-style orchestrations. In 2005, The Black Eyed Peas's \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\" used music pieces from two of their songs: \"Ae Naujawan\" from the 1972 film Apradh and \"Yeh Mera Dil\" from the 1978 film Don, which won the American hip-hop group a Grammy Award. On 24 August 2000, Kalyanji breathed his last. His era with Anandji will always be remembered for their great contributions. Kalyanji's dream for training new and young talents and promoting them is carried on today by Anandji in the name of Little Stars. The composers composed some outstanding songs rendered by the legend Kishore Kumar such as \"Jeevan se bhari teri aankhe\", \"Zindagi ka safar hai ye kaisa Safar\", \"Pal pal dilke paas\", \"Neele Neele Ambar Par\". Their composition called \"Pal bharke liye\" was used in an episode of The Simpsons. Remixed version of the song \"Apni Toh Jaise Taise,\" originally from the 1981 film Laawaris was used in 2010 Bollywood film Housefull. The Calcutta High Court restrained producer Sajid Nadiadwala from the cinematic use of the song. The duo composed 297 songs for Lata in their career, the 3rd highest songs composed by any composer for Lata's career. The superhit song include \"Jiska Mujhe Tha Intezaar\" from Don (1978), \"Kabhi Raat Din Hum Door The\" from Aamne Saamne (1967), \"Yeh Saman\" from Jab Jab Phool Khile (1965), \"Humare Siva Tumhare Aur Kitne deewane\" from Apradh (1978]], \"Main Pyaasa Tum saawan' from Faraar (1975) etc. The duo composed 297 songs for Asha, the same number they composed for Lata, indicating that they emphasized Asha and Lata almost equally. Their superhit songs with Asha is led by all time hit \"Yeh Mera Dil\" from Don (1978). It earned Asha's 7th and last Filmfare Award as best singer. It was copied by world's leading band Black Eyed Peas in 1990 and their song earned Grammy Award. BEP's song included another K-A Bhosle number, \"Aye Naujawan\". Their other hits with Asha includes \"Kya Dekhte Ho\" from Qurbani (1978), \"O Saathi Re\" from Muqaddar Ka Siqandar (1978) Their songs repeatedly entered the top popularity ratings of Binaca Geetmala and topped the list many times. Some of their notable compositions, by song title, are as follows: Prakash Mehra Manoj Kumar Feroz Khan Manmohan Desai Sultan Ahmed Rajiv Rai Gulshan Rai Subhash Ghai"

        "artist_name": "Kavita_Krishnamurthy", 
        "biography": " Kavita Krishnamurthy is an Indian film playback singer. Trained in classical music, she has sung a wide range of classical-based songs. In her career, she has worked with a variety of music composers, including Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal, R. D. Burman, Hamsalekha and A. R. Rahman. She is also the recipient of four Filmfare Best Female Playback Singer Awards, including three consecutive awards in the period 1994\u20131996, and the Padmashri which she received in 2005. In 1999, she married violinist L. Subramaniam.   Kavita was born Sharada Krishnamurthy in a Tamil Iyer family in New Delhi, India to T.S. Krishnamurthy, an employee of Education Ministry. She began her music training upon insistence of her aunt, Ms. Protimma Bhattacharya who enrolled her to Ms. Suruma Basu, who taught her Rabindra Sangeet. She began her formal training in Hindustani classical music under Balram Puri, a classical singer. At the young age of eight, Kavita won a gold medal at a music competition. She won many medals participating in the Inter-Ministry Classical Competition in New Delhi in the mid 1960s. During her College days at St. Xavier College, Mumbai, she got an opportunity to record a Tagore song in Bengali with Lata Mangeshkar under the auspices of the music composer and singer Hemant Kumar. Although the young Sharada aspired to work with Indian Foreign Services, she moved to Bombay when she was 14 to try her luck as a playback singer in the Hindi film industry. She is an alumnus of St. Xavier's College, Bombay from where she did her BA Honors Economics. She was very active in the St. Xavier's Music Group during her college days. During the annual college festival (Malhar), she met Ranu Mukherjee, the daughter of Hemant Kumar. Ranu took the initiative of reintroducing Kavita to her father. He was impressed by her grounding in music, so he began using her as a singer during his live performances. In one such performance, playback singer Manna Dey spotted her and employed her to sing advertisement jingles. Through her aunt's strong contacts, she met Jaya Chakravarthy, the mother of actress Hema Malini, who later took the initiative of introducing Kavita to the music director Laxmikant (one of the composer duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal) in late 1976. Laxmikant gave her an option to work as a dubbing artiste or a career in playback singing. Kavita chose the latter and impressed Laxmikant with her extremely strong grasp of Hindustani classical music. Initially, she recorded songs and cut demos of songs intended for singers like Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle. In her struggling phase, she received the patronage of music composers Laxmikant\u2014Pyarelal, who backed her so strongly that she was labelled as a singer exclusively working with them. This gave many music directors an excuse to avoid working with her. In 1978, she first sang the Kannada song \"Ondanondu kaaladalli\" in the film Ondanondu kaaladalli where Shankar nag acted. Then she sang so many Kannada songs in 1990-2000s. In 1980, she sang the song, \"Kaahe Ko Byaahi\" in the film Maang Bharo Sajana, which featured her singing in her own voice. Unfortunately, the song was dropped from the final cut of the film. In 1985, her career took off with her first major hit, \"Tumse Milkar Na Jaane Kyon\" from the Hindi film Pyaar Jhukta Nahin. Post the success of the song, it opened up opportunities beyond the Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal camp. However, \"Hawa Hawaii\" and \"Karte Hain Hum Pyaar Mr. India Se\", two popular songs from the equally popular movie Mr. India (1987), proved to be a turning point in her career. (The songs were composed by music composers Laxmikant-Pyarelal, the latter being a duet with Kishore Kumar and lip-synced on screen by actress Sridevi.) Her collaboration with Laxmikant-Pyarelal produced several hits. The 1990s thrust Kavita into being known as one of the leading female playback singers. Her performance as a singer in the film 1942: A Love Story, composed by R.D. Burman won her much popular acclaim. With a string of hits from 1942: A Love Story, Yaraana, Agni Sakshi, Bhairavi, and Khamoshi, Kavita established herself as a leading singer. She went on to work with several music directors of Hindi films of the 1990s, such as Bappi Lahiri, Anand-Milind, A. R. Rahman, Rajesh Roshan, Raamlaxman, Ismail Darbar, Nadeem-Shravan, Jatin Lalit, Viju Shah and Anu Malik. During her stint as a playback singer, she sang duets with the leading male singers of her times, from Kishore Kumar and Suresh Wadkar to Mohammed Aziz, Amit Kumar, Manhar Udhas, Kumar Sanu, Abhijeet Bhattacharya, Udit Narayan, Sudesh Bhonsle, Babul Supriyo, Vinod Rathod, S.P. Balasubrahmaniam and Sonu Nigam. Her female duets mostly have been with Alka Yagnik, Anuradha Paudwal and Sadhana Sargam. After her marriage to violinist Dr. L. Subramaniam in Bangalore on 11 November 1999, Kavita got extremely selective and cut down on her film singing. She started expanding her artistic range to areas which were never explored. She was the main featured soloist in the Global Fusion album released by Warner Bros., featuring musicians from five continents. As she actively started exploring fusion music, Kavita traveled around the world including to the US, UK, Europe, Africa, Australia, East Asia, the Middle East, and South America. She performed in concert halls including Royal Albert Hall in London, The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Madison Square Garden, The Lincoln Center in New York City, the Zhongshan Music Hall in Beijing, The Esplanade in Singapore, The Putra Jaya World Trade Centre in Kuala Lumpur, and Gewandhaus Leipzigm. Although primarily a playback singer, Kavita has sung with orchestras as a soloist; she collaborated with Western artists from jazz, pop and classical fields. She has lent her voice for many ghazal and devotional music albums. Both as a fusion music singer and as a playback singer, Kavita has performed throughout India. In 2014, she also sang a song titled \"Koi Chahat Koi Hasrat\" for the album Women's Day Special: Spreading Melodies Everywhere. It was composed by Nayab Raja and penned by Dipti Mishra. Their son Ambi and daughter Bindu are well trained in Indian music as well as in Western music. They give performances in India and the world over. Kavita's playback singing career in south India started with Kannada films. Her first film song was in the Kannada film Ondanondu kaladalli (1978) with the same title. She has sung many hit songs in Kannada since then. Songs like \"Bareyada mounada Kavithe\"(Sparsha), \"Hoove Hoove\"(H2O), \"Endo Kanda kanasu\"(Lankesh Patrike), \"O malle o dumbi\"('Naga Devate'), \"Kaveri Kaveri\"(Raja Huli) and many more superhit songs made her name house hold in Karnataka. Due to her participation in fusion and pop music, Kavita has lent her voice for several pop and devotional albums. The most prominent ones being: Kavita Subramaniam has been making appearances in various music reality shows as a guest judge owing to her popularity as a playback singer. She recently was a judge for Bharat Ki Shaan: Singing Star (Season 1), which aired on DD National at prime time. She also appeared in Vijay TV Airtel Super Singer and Colors Bangla Great Music Gurukul. She has also sung for serials like Mahabharat, Ramayan (1986), Shri Krishna, and Ramayan (2008). Kavita Krishnamurthy married Dr. L. Subramaniam in Bengaluru, Karnataka on 11 November 1999. They have no children. Subramaniam has four children from his previous marriage. His eldest daughter Gingger Shankar is a singer, composer and multi-instrumentalist while Bindu Subramaniam is a law graduate and singer/songwriter. Narayana is a qualified doctor while the youngest, Ambi Subramaniam, is an accomplished violinist. Kavita and her family have settled in Bengaluru since Kavita's marriage. Kavita and her husband have started music institute, called the Subramaniam Academy of Performing Arts, in Bengaluru in 2007. In March 2013, she launched her own app which is available for free download in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store."

        "artist_name": "Kishore_Kumar", 
        "biography": " Kishore Kumar (4 August 1929 \u2013 13 October 1987) was an Indian film playback singer, actor, lyricist, composer, producer, director, and screenwriter. He is considered one of the most successful playback singers of the Hindi film industry. Apart from Hindi, he sang in many Indian languages including Bengali, Marathi, Assamese, Gujarati, Kannada, Bhojpuri, Malayalam, Odia, and Urdu. He has also sung in private albums in several languages especially in Bengali which are noted as all time classics. He won 8 Filmfare Awards for Best Male Playback Singer and holds the record for winning the most Filmfare Awards in that category. He was awarded the \"Lata Mangeshkar Award\" by the Madhya Pradesh government and from that year onwards, the Madhya Pradesh Government initiated a new award called the \"Kishore Kumar Award\" for contributions to Hindi cinema.   Kishore Kumar was born in a Bengali family in Khandwa, Central Provinces (now in Madhya Pradesh) as Abhas Kumar Ganguly. His father Kunjalal Ganguly (Gangopadhyay) was a lawyer and his mother Gouri Devi came from a wealthy Bengali family. Kunjalal Gangopadhyaya was invited by the Kamavisadar Gokhale family of Khandwa to be their personal lawyer. Kishore was the youngest of four siblings, the other three were Ashok (the eldest), Sati Devi, and Anoop. While Kishore was still a child, his brother Ashok became a Bollywood actor. Later, Anoop also ventured into cinema with Ashok's help. Spending time with his brothers, Kishore became interested in films and music. He became a fan of singer-actor K. L. Saigal\u2014whom he considered his guru, and tried to emulate his singing style. He graduated from Christian College, Indore. After Ashok Kumar became a star of Hindi films, the Ganguly family visited Mumbai regularly. Abhas Kumar changed his name to Kishore and started his cinema career as a chorus singer at Bombay Talkies, where his brother worked. Kumar's first film appearance was in Shikari (1946), in which his brother Ashok played the lead role. Music director Khemchand Prakash gave Kumar a chance to sing \"Marne ki duayen kyon mangu\" for the film Ziddi (1948). After this, Kumar was offered many other assignments, but he was not very serious about a film career. In 1949, he settled in Mumbai.[citation needed] Kumar played the hero in the Bombay Talkies film Andolan (1951), directed by Phani Majumdar. Although he got some acting assignments with the help of his brother, he was more interested in becoming a singer. Ashok wanted Kumar to be an actor like him. Kumar next starred in Bimal Roy's Naukri (1954) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's directorial debut Musafir (1957). Salil Chowdhury, the music director for Naukri, was initially dismissive of Kumar as a singer when he found that Kumar had no formal training in music. However, after hearing his voice, Chowdhury gave him the song Chhota sa ghar hoga, which was supposed to be sung by Hemant Kumar.[citation needed] Kumar starred in films New Delhi (1957), Aasha (1957), Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958), Half Ticket (1962), Ganga Ki Lehren, Padosan (1968). Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958), his home production, starred the three Ganguly brothers and Madhubala. Kumar played a car mechanic who has a romance with a city girl (Madhubala) with a subplot involving the brothers.:29 In the movie Half Ticket, for one of the songs - Aake Seedhi Lagi Dil Pe - the music director Salil Chowdhary had a duet in mind and wanted Kishore Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar sing the song. However, since Lata Mangeshkar was not in town and Salil Chowdhury had to record that song before Lata Manageshkar could return Kishore Kumar solved the problem by singing for both the male and female versions of the song himself. The duet is actually for Pran and Kishore Kumar on the screen dressed as a woman. It just turned out to be fine as he did admirably well singing as both the male and female. Music director S. D. Burman is credited with spotting Kumar's talent for singing. During the making of Mashaal (1950), Burman visited Ashok's house, where he heard Kumar imitating K. L. Saigal. He complimented him and told him that he should develop a style of his own, instead of copying Saigal. Kumar eventually developed his own style of singing, which featured yodeling, which he had heard on the records of Tex Morton and Jimmie Rodgers.:60 Burman recorded in Kumar's voice for Dev Anand's Munimji (1954), Taxi Driver (1954), House No. 44 (1955), Funtoosh (1956), Nau Do Gyarah (1957), Paying Guest (1957), Guide (1965), Jewel Thief (1967), Prem Pujari (1970), and Tere Mere Sapne (1971). He also composed music for Kumar's home production Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958). Some of their songs were; \"Maana Janaab Ne Pukara Nahin\" from Paying Guest, \"Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke\" from Nau Do Gyarah (1957), \"Ai Meri Topi Palat Ke Aa\" from Funtoosh, and \"Ek Ladki Bheegi Bhaagi Si\" and \"Haal Kaisa Hai Janaab Ka\" from Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958). Asha Bhosle and Kumar performed duets composed by Burman including \"Chhod Do Aanchal\" from Paying Guest (1957), \"Ankhon Mein Kya Ji\" from Nau Do Gyarah (1957), \"Haal Kaisa Hai Janaab Ka\" and \"Paanch Rupaiya Baara Aana\" from Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958) and \"Arre Yaar Meri Tum Bhi Ho Gajab\" from Teen Deviyan (1965). Music director C. Ramchandra also recognized Kumar's talent as a singer. They collaborated on songs including \"Eena Meena Deeka\" from Aasha (1957). Kishore Kumar's work includes \"Nakhrewaali\" from New Delhi (1956) by Shankar Jaikishan, \"C.A.T. Cat Maane Billi\" and \"Hum To Mohabbat Karega\" from Dilli Ka Thug (1958) by Ravi, and \"Chhedo Na Meri Zulfein\" from Ganga Ki Lahren (1964) by Chitragupta.[citation needed] Kumar produced, directed, acted in composed the music for Jhumroo (1961), and wrote the lyrics for the film's title song, \"Main Hoon Jhumroo\". Later, he produced and directed Door Gagan Ki Chhaon Mein (1964). He wrote the script and composed music for the film, which is about the relationship between a father (Kishore Kumar) and his deaf and mute son (played by his real-life son (Amit Kumar).:52 In the 1960s, as an actor, Kishore Kumar built up a notoriety for coming late for the shootings or bunking them altogether. His films flopped frequently and he landed in income tax trouble. As a singer, his work in this period includes \"Zaroorat Hai Zaroorat Hai\" from Manmauji (1961), \"Gaata Rahe Mera Dil\" from Guide (1965), and \"Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara\" from Jewel Thief (1967). In the late 1960s, Rahul Dev Burman worked with Kishore Kumar on the soundtrack of the film Padosan (1968), in which Kumar sang \"Mere Saamne Wali Khidki Mein\" and \"Kehna Hai.\" Padosan was a comedy in which Kumar as a dramatist-musician, Mehmood as a Carnatic music and dance teacher, and Sunil Dutt as a simpleton named Bhola. Kumar's character was inspired by his uncle, Dhananjay Bannerjee, a classical singer. The highlight of the film was a musical, comical duel between Kishore Kumar-Sunil Dutt and Mehmood: \"Ek Chatur Nar Karke Singaar.\" In 1969, Shakti Samanta produced and directed Aradhana. He sang three songs in the film; \"Mere Sapnon Ki Rani\", \"Kora Kagaj Tha Ye Man Mera\" and \"Roop Tera Mastana\". Shakti Samanta suggested that Kumar sing the other songs. When the film was released, Kumar's two songs established him as a leading Bollywood playback singer. Kishore Kumar won his first Filmfare award for\"Roop Tera Mastana\".:54 In the 1970s and 1980s, Kumar sang for Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Jeetendra, Sanjeev Kumar, Dev Anand,Shammi Kapoor, Shashi Kapoor, Mithun Chakraborty, Vinod Khanna, Dilip Kumar,Raaj Kumar, Randhir Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor, Rajiv Kapoor, Aditya Pancholi, Naseeruddin Shah, Sanjay Dutt, Sunny Deol, Anil Kapoor, Rakesh Roshan, Pran, Sachin, Vinod Mehra, Rajini Kanth, Chunky Pandey, Kumar Gaurav, Govinda and Jackie Shroff.[citation needed] S.

Although he was not formally trained in the classical music, R.D. Burman often had Kumar sing semi-classical songs, such as \"Hamein Tum Se Pyaar Kitna\" from Kudrat and \"Mere Naina Saawan Bhadon\" from Mehbooba.[citation needed] R.D.

As a result, Information and broadcasting minister Vidya Charan Shukla (1975\u20131977) put an unofficial ban on playing Kishore Kumar songs on state broadcasters All India Radio and Doordarshan from 4 May 1976 till the end of Emergency. Kishore Kumar produced and directed some movies in the late 1970s and early 1980s, such as Badhti Ka Naam Daadhi (1978), Zindagi (1981) and Door Wadiyon Mein Kahin (1980)\u2014his last appearance as an actor.[citation needed] With patronage from R. D. Burman and Rajesh Roshan, Kumar's son Amit Kumar became a Bollywood singer in the 1980s. Kumar continued singing for several actors and performed in stage shows to earn money to pay his income tax arrears. Kumar stopped singing for Amitabh Bachchan in the mid-1980s after Bachchan refused to appear as a guest in the film Mamta Ki Chhaon Mein which Kumar produced, but called a truce with Amitabh by singing for him in Toofan. He also temporarily stopped singing for Mithun Chakraborty after Yogeeta Bali divorced him and married Chakraborty. However, Kumar sang for Chakraborty in Surakkhsha in the 1970s, and in the 1980s in many films, including Disco Dancer, Fareib and Waqt Ki Awaz.[citation needed] In the mid-1980s, Kumar sang for Anil Kapoor in Kapoor's debut film as a leading man, Woh Saat Din and also recorded Mr. India. He sang a duet with Alka Yagnik, \"Tumse Badhkar Duniya Mein Na Dekha\" for Kaamchor in 1982 and recorded some songs for the film Saagar with R. D. Burman. By this time, Kumar had decided to retire and was planning to return to his birthplace Khandwa. On 13 October 1987\u2014his brother Ashok's 76th birthday\u2014he died of a heart attack in Mumbai at 4:45 pm. His body was taken to Khandwa for cremation. Kumar had recorded his last song, Guru Guru\u2014a duet with Asha Bhosle for the film Waqt Ki Aawaz (1988) composed by Bappi Lahiri for Mithun Chakraborty and Sridevi\u2014the day before he died.[citation needed] His song Pal Bhar Ke Liye from the film Johny Mera Naam (1970) was used in an episode of The Simpsons titled \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore\". His songs have been featured in several films, including Such a Long Journey (1998) and Side Streets (1998). Sony TV organised the television singing contest K For Kishore to search for a singer like Kishore Kumar.[citation needed] Kishore Kumar married four times. His first wife was Bengali singer and actress Ruma Guha Thakurta aka Ruma Ghosh. Their marriage lasted from 1950 to 1958.:53 His second wife was actress Madhubala, who had worked with him in many films including his home production Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958) and Jhumroo (1961). When Kumar proposed to her, Madhubala was ill and was planning to go to London for treatment. She had a ventricular septal defect (hole in the heart), and he was still married to Ruma. After his divorce, the couple had a civil wedding in 1960 and Kishore Kumar converted to Islam and reportedly changed his name to Karim Abdul. His parents refused to attend. The couple also had a Hindu ceremony to please Kumar's parents, but Madhubala was never truly accepted as his wife. Within a month of her wedding she moved back to her bungalow in Bandra because of tension in the Kumar household. They remained married but under great strain for the remainder of Madhubala's life. Their marriage ended with Madhubala's death on 23 February 1969. Kumar's third marriage was to Yogeeta Bali, and lasted from 1976 to 4 August 1978. Kishore was married to Leena Chandavarkar from 1980 until his death. He had two sons, Amit Kumar with Ruma, and Sumit Kumar with Leena Chandavarkar. Kumar is said to have been paranoid about not being paid. During recordings, he would sing only after his secretary confirmed that the producer had made the payment. On one occasion, when he discovered that his dues had not been fully paid, he appeared on set with makeup on only one side of his face. When the director questioned him, he replied \"Aadha paisa to aadha make-up.\" (Half make-up for half payment). On the sets of Bhai Bhai, Kishore Kumar refused to act because the director M V Raman owed him \u20b9 5,000. Ashok Kumar persuaded him to do the scene but when the shooting started, Kumar walked across the floor, walked a few places and said, Paanch Hazzar Rupaiya (five thousand rupees) and did a somersault. After he reached the end of the floor, he left the studio. On another occasion, when producer R.C. Talwar did not pay his dues in spite of repeated reminders, Kumar arrived at Talwar's residence and shouting \"Hey Talwar, de de mere aath hazaar\" (\"Hey Talwar, give me my eight thousand\") every morning until Talwar paid him. The film Anand (1971) was originally supposed to star Kumar and Mehmood Ali in the lead. Hrishikesh Mukherjee, the director of the film, was asked to meet Kumar to discuss the project. However, when he went to Kumar's house he was driven away by the gatekeeper due to a misunderstanding. Kumar\u2014himself a Bengali\u2014had not been paid for a stage show organized by another Bengali man and had instructed his gatekeeper to drive away this \"Bengali\", if he ever visited the house. Consequently, Mehmood had to leave the film as well, and new actors (Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan) were signed up for the film. In spite of his \"no money, no work\" principle, sometimes Kumar recorded for free even when the producers were willing to pay. Such films include those produced by Rajesh Khanna and Danny Denzongpa. On one occasion, Kumar helped actor-turned-producer Bipin Gupta by giving him \u20b9 20,000 for the film Dal Mein Kala (1964). When actor Arun Kumar Mukherjee\u2014one of the first persons to appreciate Kishore's singing talent\u2014died, Kumar regularly sent money to Mukherjee's family in Bhagalpur. Many journalists and writers have written about Kishore Kumar's seemingly eccentric behavior. He placed a sign that said \"Beware of Kishore\" at the door of his Warden Road flat. Once, producer-director H. S. Rawail, who owed him some money, visited his flat to pay the dues. Kumar took the money and when Rawail offered to shake hands with him, Kumar reportedly put Rawail's hand in his mouth, bit it and asked \"Didn\u2019t you see the sign?\". Rawail laughed off the incident and left quickly. According to another reported incident, once Kumar was due to record a song for producer-director G. P. Sippy. As Sippy approached his bungalow, he saw Kumar going out in his car. Sippy asked Kumar to stop his car but Kumar increased his speed. Sippy chased him to Madh Island where Kumar finally stopped his car near the ruined Madh Fort. When Sippy questioned his strange behavior, Kumar refused to recognize or talk to him and threatened to call the police. The next morning, Kumar reported for the recording session. An angry Sippy questioned him about his behaviour the previous day but Kumar said that Sippy must have dreamt the incident and said that he was in Khandwa on the previous day. Once, a producer went to court to get a decree that Kumar must follow the director's orders. As a consequence, he obeyed the director to the letter. He refused to alight from his car until the director ordered him to do so. After filming a car scene in Mumbai, Kumar drove until he reached Khandala because the director forgot to say \"Cut\". In the 1960s, a financier named Kalidas Batvabbal, who was disgusted with Kumar's alleged lack of cooperation during the shooting of Half Ticket, reported to the income tax authorities, who raided his house. Later, Kumar invited Batvabbal to his home, asked him to enter a cupboard for a chat and locked him inside. He unlocked Batvabbal after two hours and told him, \"Don\u2019t ever come to my house again\". Kishore Kumar was a loner; in an interview with Pritish Nandy (1985) he said that he had no friends\u2014he preferred talking to his trees instead. Once, when a reporter made a comment about how lonely he must be, Kishore Kumar took her to his garden, named some of the trees there and introduced them to the reporter as his closest friends.

        "artist_name": "Lata_Mangeshkar", 
        "biography": " Lata Mangeshkar (\u00a0pronunciation\u00a0(help\u00b7info)) (born 28 September 1929) is an Indian playback singer, and occasional music-composer. She is one of the best-known and most respected playback singers in India. Mangeshkar's career started in 1942 and has spanned over seven decades. She has recorded songs for over a thousand Hindi films and has sung songs in over thirty-six regional Indian languages and foreign languages, though primarily in Marathi and Hindi. She is the elder sister of singers Asha Bhosle, Hridaynath Mangeshkar, Usha Mangeshkar and Meena Mangeshkar. India's highest award in cinema, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, was bestowed on her in 1989 by the Government of India. She is the second vocalist, after M. S. Subbulakshmi, to have ever been awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.   Lata Mangeshkar was born in a Marathi-speaking Gomantak Maratha family, in the princely state of Indore, part of the Central India Agency (now part of Madhya Pradesh). Her father, Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar, was a classical singer and theater actor. Her mother Shevanti (Shudhamati) who was from Thalner, Maharashtra, was Deenanath's second wife. The family's last name used to be Hardikar; Deenanath changed it to Mangeshkar in order to identify his family with his native town, Mangeshi in Goa. Lata was named \"Hema\" at her birth. Her parents later renamed her Lata after a female character, Latika, in one of her father's plays, BhaawBandhan. Lata is the eldest child of her parents. Meena, Asha, Usha and Hridaynath are her siblings in sequence. Mangeshkar took her first lessons from her father. At the age of five, she started to work as an actress in her father's musical plays (Sangeet Natak in Marathi). On the first day in the school, she started teaching songs to other children. When the teacher stopped her, she was so angry that she stopped going to the school. Other sources cite that she left school because they would not allow her to bring Asha with her, as she would often bring her younger sister with her. In 1942, when Mangeshkar was 13, her father died of heart disease. Master Vinayak (Vinayak Damodar Karnataki), the owner of Navyug Chitrapat movie company and a close friend of the Mangeshkar family, took care of them. He helped Lata get started in a career as a singer and actress. Mangeshkar sang the song \"Naachu Yaa Gade, Khelu Saari Mani Haus Bhaari\" which was composed by Sadashivrao Nevrekar for Vasant Joglekar's Marathi movie Kiti Hasaal (1942), but the song was dropped from the final cut. Vinayak gave her a small role in Navyug Chitrapat's Marathi movie Pahili Mangalaa-gaur (1942), in which she sang \"Natali Chaitraachi Navalaai\" which was composed by Dada Chandekar. Her first Hindi song was \"Mata Ek Sapoot Ki Duniya Badal De Tu\" for the Marathi film, Gajaabhaau (1943). Mangeshkar moved to Mumbai in 1945 when Master Vinayak's company moved its headquarters there. She started taking lessons in Hindustani classical music from Ustad Amanat Ali Khan. She sang \u201cPaa Lagoon Kar Jori\u201d for Vasant Joglekar's Hindi-language movie Aap Ki Seva Mein (1946), which was composed by Datta Davjekar. The dance in the film was performed by Rohini Bhate who later became a famous classical dancer. Mangeshkar and her sister Asha played minor roles in Vinayak's first Hindi-language movie, Badi Maa (1945). In that movie, Lata also sang a bhajan, \"Maata Tere Charnon Mein.\" She was introduced to music director Vasant Desai during the recording of Vinayak's second Hindi-language movie, Subhadra (1946). Following the partition of India in 1947, Ustad Amanat Ali Khan migrated to newly formed Pakistan, so Mangeshkar started to learn classical music under Amanat Khan Devaswale, the nephew of Rajab Ali Khan. Pandit Tulsidas Sharma, a pupil of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, also trained her. After Vinayak's death in 1948, music director Ghulam Haider mentored her as a singer. He introduced Mangeshkar to producer Sashadhar Mukherjee, who was working then on the movie Shaheed (1948), but Mukherjee dismissed Mangeshkar's voice as \"too thin\". An annoyed Haider responded that in coming years producers and directors would \"fall at Lata's feet\" and \"beg her\" to sing in their movies. Haider gave Lata her first major break with the song \"Dil Mera Toda, Mujhe Kahin Ka Na Chhora\"\u2014lyrics by Nazim Panipati\u2014from the movie Majboor (1948), which became her first big breakthrough film hit. In an interview on her 84th birthday, in September 2013, Lata herself declared, \"Ghulam Haider is truly my Godfather. He was the first music director who showed complete faith in my talent.\" Initially, Mangeshkar is said to have imitated the acclaimed singer Noor Jehan, but later she developed her own style of singing. Lyrics of songs in Hindi movies are primarily composed by Urdu poets and contain a higher proportion of Urdu words, including the dialogue. Actor Dilip Kumar once made a mildly disapproving remark about Mangeshkar's Maharashtrian accent while singing Hindi/Urdu songs; so for a period of time, Lata took lessons in Urdu from an Urdu teacher named Shafi. One of her first major hits was \"Aayega Aanewaala,\" a song in the movie Mahal (1949), composed by music director Khemchand Prakash and lip-synced on screen by actress Madhubala. In the 1950s, Mangeshkar sang songs composed by various music directors of the period, including Anil Biswas (in films such as Tarana and Heer), Shankar Jaikishan, Naushad Ali, S. D. Burman, Pandit Amarnath Husan Lal Bhagat Ram (in films like Bari Behan, Meena Bazaar, Afsana, Aadhi Raat, Ansoo, Chhoti Bhabi, Adal-e-Jehangir) C. Ramchandra, Hemant Kumar, Salil Chowdhury, Khayyam, Ravi, Sajjad Hussain, Roshan, Kalyanji-Anandji, Vasant Desai, Sudhir Phadke, Hansraj Behl, Madan Mohan, and Usha Khanna. She made her debut in Tamil playback singing with Vanaradham in 1956 (Uran Khotala dubbed in Tamil) with Tamil song Enthan Kannalan picturised on Nimmi in the dubbed version composed by Naushad. Mangeshkar sang many raga-based songs for Naushad in movies such as Deedar (1951), Baiju Bawra (1952), Amar (1954), Uran Khatola (1955) and Mother India (1957). Ae Chorre Ki Jaat Badi Bewafa, a duet with G. M. Durrani, was her first song for composer, Naushad. The duo, Shankar-Jaikishan, chose Mangeshkar for Barsaat (1949), Aah (1953), Shree 420 (1955), and Chori Chori (1956). Before 1957, composer S. D. Burman chose Mangeshkar as the leading female singer for his musical scores in Sazaa (1951), House No. 44 (1955), and Devdas (1955). However a rift developed between Lata and Burman in 1957, and Lata did not sing Burman's compositions again until 1962. Mangeshkar won a Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer for Salil Chowdhury's composition \"Aaja Re Pardesi,\" from Madhumati (1958). In the early fifties, Lata Mangeshkar's association with C. Ramchandra produced songs in movies such as Albela (1951), Shin Shinkai Bublaa Boo (1952), Anarkali (1953), Pehli Jhhalak (1954), Azad (1955), Asha (1957) and Amardeep (1958). For Madan Mohan, she performed for films like Baagi (1953) Railway Platform (1955), Pocketmar (1956), Mr. Lambu (1956), Dekh Kabira Roya (1957), Adalat (1958), Jailor (1958), Mohar (1959) and Chacha Zindabad (1959). Mangeshkar's song \"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya\" from Mughal-e-Azam (1960), composed by Naushad and picturized on Madhubala, still remains famous . The Hawaiian-themed number \"Ajeeb Dastaan Hai Yeh\" from Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai (1960) was composed by Shankar Jaikishan and picturized on Meena Kumari. In 1961, Mangeshkar recorded two popular bhajans, \"Allah Tero Naam\" and \"Prabhu Tero Naam\", for Burman's assistant, Jaidev. In 1962, she was awarded her second Filmfare Award for the song \"Kahin Deep Jale Kahin Dil\" from Bees Saal Baad, composed by Hemant Kumar. In the early 1962 she was given slow poison. The doctor was called. He came with an x-ray machine to check her, and gave her an injection to render her unconscious, because She was in pain. For three days, She had a close brush with death. After ten days, she began to recover. The doctor told her that somebody gave her slow poison. The slow poison incident rendered her very weak. She was bed-ridden for nearly 3 months. The most surprising thing was that soon after the incident, the cook who used to work at Lataji's home, suddenly vanished without taking his wages. The cook had earlier worked with some Bollywood people. Bollywood lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri used to regularly visit Lataji at her home daily at 6 pm. Majrooh used to first taste the food and then allow Lata to eat. He used to recite poems and stories to keep Lata in good humour. On 27 January 1963, against the backdrop of the Sino-Indian War, Mangeshkar sang the patriotic song \"Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo\" (literally, \"Oh, People of My Country\") in the presence of Jawaharlal Nehru, then the Prime Minister of India. The song, composed by C. Ramchandra and written by Kavi Pradeep, is said to have brought the Prime Minister to tears. In 1963, Mangeshkar returned to collaboration with S. D. Burman. She also sang for R. D. Burman's very first film Chhote Nawaab and later for his films such as Bhoot Bangla (1965), Pati Patni (1966), Baharon ke Sapne (1967) and Abhilasha (1969). She also recorded several popular songs for S. D. Burman, including \"Aaj Phir Jeene Ki Tamanna Hai\", \"Gata Rahe Mera Dil\" (duet with Kishore Kumar) and \"Piya Tose\" from Guide (1965), and \"Hothon Pe Aisi Baat\" from Jewel Thief (1967). During the 1960s, Lata Mangeshkar continued her association with Madan Mohan which included the songs \"Aap Ki Nazron Ne Samjha\" from Anpadh (1962), \"Lag Ja Gale\" and \"Naina Barse Rim Jhim\" from Woh Kaun Thi?

The 1960s also witnessed the beginning of Mangeshkar's association with Laxmikant-Pyarelal, the music directors for whom she sang the most popular songs in her career. Starting in 1963, Laxmikant-Pyarelal association with Lata Mangeshkar grew stronger over the years. Lata Mangeshkar sang over 700 songs for the composer duo over a period of 35 long years, most of which became huge hits. She sang for Parasmani (1963), Mr. X in Bombay (1964), Aaye Din Bahar Ke (1966), Milan (1967), Anita (1967) Shagird (1968), Mere Hamdam Mere Dost (1968), Intaquam (1969), Do Raaste (1969) and Jeene Ki Raah for which she got her 3rd Filmfare Award. She also sang several playback songs for Marathi films, composed by Marathi music directors including Hridaynath Mangeshkar, Vasant Prabhu, Srinivas Khale, Sudhir Phadke and herself (under the name Anandghan). During the 1960s and 1970s, she also sang several Bengali songs, composed by music directors like Salil Chowdhury and Hemant Kumar. She also made her Kannada debut in 1967 for the film Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna by recording two songs for the music director Lakshman Berlekar. The song \"Bellane Belagayithu\" was received well and appreciated.[citation needed] In this period Lata Mangeshkar has recorded duets with Mukesh, Manna Dey, Mahendra Kapoor, Mohammed Rafi, and Kishore Kumar. For a brief period during the 1960s, she was not on good terms with Mohammed Rafi over the issue of royalty payments to singers. Mangeshkar wanted Rafi to back her in demanding a half-share from the five percent song royalty that the film's producer conceded to select composers. But Rafi took a diametrically opposite view, and believed that a playback singer's claim on the filmmaker ended with the payment of the agreed fee for the song. This led to tensions between the two. After an argument during the recording of the song Tasveer Teri Dil Mein (Maya, 1961), the two refused to sing with each other. The music director Jaikishan later negotiated a reconciliation between the two. In 1972, Meena Kumari's last film, Pakeezah, was released. It featured popular songs including \"Chalte Chalte\" and \"Inhi Logon Ne\" sung by Lata Mangeshkar, and composed by Ghulam Mohammed. She recorded many popular songs for S. D.

Lata Mangeshkar's most notable songs in the 1970s were composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal (Laxmi-Pyare) and Rahul Dev Burman. She recorded several songs composed by Laxmi-Pyare in the 1960s and 1970s, many of them written by the lyricist Anand Bakshi. She also recorded many hit songs with Rahul Dev Burman in the films Amar Prem (1972), Caravan (1971), Kati Patang (1971), and Aandhi (1975).

She was later awarded Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993. In 1984, the State Government of Madhya Pradesh instituted the Lata Mangeshkar Award in honour of Lata Mangeshkar. The State Government of Maharashtra also instituted a Lata Mangeshkar Award in 1992. In 1974, The Guinness Book of Records listed Lata Mangeshkar as the most recorded artist in the history, stating that she had reportedly recorded \"not less than 25,000 solo, duet and chorus backed songs in 20 Indian languages\" between 1948 and 1974. Her record was contested by Mohammad Rafi, who was claimed to have sung around 28,000 songs. After Rafi's death, in its 1984 edition, the Guinness Book of World Records stated Lata Mangeshkar's name for the \"Most Recordings\", but also stated Rafi's claim. The later editions of Guinness Book stated that Lata Mangeshkar had sung no fewer than 30,000 songs between 1948 and 1987. The entry was discontinued by Guinness editions in 1991 without explanation, while several sources continued to claim that she recorded thousands of songs, with estimates ranging up to figures as large as 50,000. However, even the earliest Guinness claim of 25,000 songs (between 1948\u20131974) was disputed and claimed to have been exaggerated by several others, stating that the number of songs sung by Lata Mangeshkar in Hindi films till 1991 was found to be 5025. Mangeshkar herself has stated that she does not keep a record of the number of songs recorded by her, and that she did not know from where Guinness Book editors got their information. In 2011, the entry was revived by Guinness crediting the record to Asha Bhosle as the most recorded artist in music history, \"for recording up to 11,000 solo, duet and chorus-backed songs and in over 20 Indian languages since 1947\"."

        "artist_name": "Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal", 
        "biography": " Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal were a popular Indian composer duo, consisting of Laxmikant Shantaram Kudalkar (1937\u20131998) and Pyarelal Ramprasad Sharma (born 1940). They composed music for about 635 Hindi movies from 1963 to 1998, working for almost all notable filmmakers.   Laxmikant Shantaram Kudalkar, was born on the day of Laxmi Puja (Diwali), on 3 November 1937. Probably, because of the day of his birth, his parents named him as Laxmikant, after the goddess Laxmi and god Vishnu. He spent his childhood amidst dire poverty in the slums of Vile Parle (East) in Mumbai.[citation needed] His father died when he was a child. Because of the poor financial condition of the family he could not complete his academic education either.[citation needed] Laxmikant's father's friend, a musician himself, advised Laxmikant and his elder brother to learn music. Accordingly, Laxmikant learned to play the mandolin and his elder brother learned to play the tabla. He spent two years in the company of the well-known mandolin player Hussain Ali. He began organising and performing in Indian Classical Instrumental Music concerts to earn some money. Later, in the 1940s, he also learned mandolin from Bal Mukund Indorker and violin from Husnalal (of the Husanlal Bhagatram fame). Laxmikant began his film career as a child actor in the Hindi films Bhakt Pundalik (1949 film) and Aankhen (1950 film). He also acted in some Gujarati films. Pyarelal Ramprasad Sharma (born 3 September 1940) was the son of a renowned trumpeter Pandit Ramprasad Sharma (popularly known as Babaji), who taught him the basics of music. He started learning violin at the age of 8 and practised it 8 to 12 hours daily. He learnt to play violin from a Goan musician named Anthony Gonsalves. The song \"My Name Is Anthony Gonsalves\" from the movie Amar Akbar Anthony is regarded as a tribute to Mr. Gonsalves (the movie had music by Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelallal). By the age of 12, his family's financial condition had deteriorated, which in turn forced him to earn money by playing in studios. Pyarelal then used to frequent and play the violin in studios such as Ranjit Studios, to earn money for his family. When Laxmikant was about 10 years old, he once played mandolin in a Lata Mangeshkar concert in Radio Club, Colaba. Lata was so impressed that she talked to him after the concert. Laxmikant and Pyarelal met at Sureel Kala Kendra, a music academy for children, run by the Mangeshkar family. After she came to know about their financially poor backgrounds, Lata recommended their names to music directors like Naushad, Sachin Dev Burman and C. Ramchandra. Similar financial backgrounds and age made Laxmikant and Pyarelal very good friends. They used to spend long hours at the recording studios, sometimes getting work for each other and even playing together whenever they got the opportunity. Pyarelal often used to frequent the Bombay Chamber Orchestra and the Paranjoti Academy, where he would perfect his skills in the company of Goody Seervai, Coomi Wadia, Mehli Mehta and his son, Zubin Mehta. Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal were not content with the payments being made to them for their music, so they decided to go to Madras (now Chennai). But, it was the same story there. So, they returned. Once Pyarelal decided to leave India and go to Vienna to play for symphony orchestras, just like Zubin. However, he stayed back at Laxmikant's insistence. Some of Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal's colleagues at this time included Pandit Shivkumar Sharma (Santoor) and Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia (flute). Later, Shivkumar and Hariprasad also ventured in Hindi Cinema as Shiv-Hari. Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal worked with almost all reputed music directors (with the exception of O. P. Nayyar and Shankar-Jaikishan) of the 1950s. In 1953, they became assistants to Kalyanji-Anandji and worked with them as assistants till 1963. They worked as music arrangers for many music directors including Sachin Dev Burman (in Ziddi) and also for his son Rahul Dev Burman (in his first film Chhote Nawab). Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal and R D Burman remained very good friends, even when Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal started giving music independently. R D Burman played mouth organ for all songs of Dosti. Laxmikant once made a guest appearance playing role of himself as a Composer of Song \"Dil Ki Baat\" in Teri Kasam (1982), which had music by R D Burman. In their early days, Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal's music was very similar to Shankar-Jaikishan's music, as Laxmikant was a great fan of theirs. Once Shankar even changed his orchestration to make sure that his music did not sound like Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal's.[citation needed] Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal's first film as music directors was not released. The first released movie which featured them as music directors was Babubhai Mistry's Parasmani (1963), which was a costume drama. All the songs of the film became immensely popular esp. \"Hasata Hua Nurani Chehara\", \"Wo Jab Yaad Aaye\" and \"Mere Dil Main Halki Si\". Throughout their tenure as music directors, Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal only used A-grade singers. Their mentors, Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammad Rafi, agreed to sing for them in spite of low budgets, and Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal always remained indebted to them. In fact, all three, Mohammad Rafi, Asha Bhosle and Lata have sung the maximum number of songs in their career for Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal.They continued to give patronage to Mohammed Rafi, sometimes against filmmakers' wishes. They had a great rapport with Kishore Kumar as well. Kishore Kumar sang maximum songs (402) for LP among all male singers, followed by Rafi(about 365 songs).[citation needed] Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal hit the big time with Rajshri Productions' 1964 film Dosti. The film had two newcomer heroes who never became popular, and the film was a success due to its music. Songs like Chahoonga main tujhe shaam savere and Rahi manava became very popular. At that time, many used to think that there was a single person by the name of Laxmikant Pyarelal. Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal won their first Filmfare Best Music Director Award for the movie, ahead of stalwarts like Shankar-Jaikishan (for Sangam) and Madan Mohan (for Woh Kaun Thi?). Then came Lootera a super hit musical non-star cast film which is remembered only because of Lata Manageshkar's super hit songs with Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal In 1966 LP started cementing their place in Hindi Film Music. LP's first musical hit film, with big star cast, Aaye Din Bahar Ke was released, followed by Pyar Kiye Jaa. Even in films with lesser-known actors, LP scored hit music: Sati Sawitri (Songs:\"Tum Gagan Ke Chandram Ho\", \"Jeevan Dor Tumhi Sang Bandhi\", \"Kabhi To Miloge\"); Sant Gyaneshwar (Songs: \"Jyot Se Jyot Jagate Chalo\", \"Khabar More Na Line\"); Hum Sab Ustaad Hai (Songs: \"Pyar Batate Chalo\", \"Ajanabi Tum Jane Pehachane Se\"); Mr. X in Bombay (Songs: \"Mere Mehaboob Quayamat Hogi\", \"Chali Re Chali Re Gori\", \"Khoobsurat Haseena\"); Shriman Fantush..(Songs: \"Sultana Sultana Tu Na Ghabarana\", \"Yeh Dard Bhara Afasana\"). In 1967, LP consolidated their position in the Hindi film industry with a series of hits by one after another. Non star cast film Farz was LP's first golden jubilee musical hit followed by big star cast films like Anita, Shagird, yet another Golden Jubilee hit, Patthar Ke Sanam, Night in London, Jaal and another evergreen musical hit Milan. LP received their second Filmfare Trophy for Milan without any stiff competition. The rise of Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal, Rahul Dev Burman, and Kalyanji-Anandji marked the end of an old era of Bollywood music, which belonged to Shankar-Jaikishan, Sachin Dev Burman, Naushad (Mausicar-e-azam), C. Ramchandra, Khayyam, Madan Mohan, O. P. Nayyar, Roshan and others. Big film producing names, like Prasad Productions, Rajashri Productions, J. Om Prakash, Raj Khosla, Manoj Kumar, Ramanand Sagar, Madan Mohla, Mohan Sahagal, V.Shantaram, Raj Kapoor, Yash Chopra, Manmohan Desai, Subhash Ghai and many more, started replacing their regular music directors and preferred Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal on regular basis and in return LP have given an outstanding music to justify the replacement with big names. The team of Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal and lyricist Anand Bakshi churned out some of the most popular songs in Hindi Cinemas history. The combo composed songs for more than 304 movies. Anand Bakshi was the lyricist who wrote the maximum number of texts Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal gave music to. He was actually the lyricist for all the films for which Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal won Filmfare Awards, except their very first award. Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal composed Indian classical music as well as Western music. Due to his flaming style of music, he earned the nickname Laxmikant \"Pyromaniac\" Pyeralal. But they were most popular for their folk tunes and semi-classical music. In Shagird, they created Rock-n-Roll-style foot-tapping melodies. The film Karz is worth specially mentioning here where LP successfully, gave disco-like music, in this film they had experimented with a ghazal \"Dard-e-dil Dard-e- jigar\" by westernising it. The song is strongly remembered even now, and the duo received the Filmfare Best Music Director Award for the year. Although not as a rule, Laxmikant mostly looked after vocals and Pyarelal used to take care of orchestration. Both had vast knowledge of various music genres, musical instruments and orchestra management. LP dominated the Weekly Hindi Film songs Countdown programme Binaca Geet Mala, the most popular musical radio programme of its time. Its first broadcast was in 1953 by Radio Ceylon and its host was the Ameen Sayani. The Binaca Geet Mala ranked the most popular Bollywood film songs according to sales in select shops in select cities. In the third quarter of 1963, LP's first ever songs Hasta Hua Nurani Chehara form Parasmani hit the \"Binaca Geet Mala\". After that LP's songs were regularly and prominently aired on \"Binaca Geet Mala\". There used to be sixteen songs in each of the weekly \"Binaca Geet Mala\" countdown programme, more than half the numbers of the songs were of LP.[citation needed]There are certain weekly Binaca Geet Mala programmes in which more than 13 out of 16 songs of LP were broadcast when LP were right on top of their career.[citation needed] BGM used to broadcast annual (Vasrshik ) programme giving the orders of the top 32 songs of every year. In this programme also LP were having upper hand. Not only that, on an average, there used to be at least more than 15 songs used to be of LP, that too about 50% of the songs in between top to first ten positions. The Binaca Geet Mala records shows that Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal have completely dominated this musical programme.[citation needed] In all, 174 songs of LP appeared in Binaca Geetmala finals. Lata Mangeshkar played a major role in shaping up the careers of LP. She sang the maximum numbers of songs for them. She sounded extremely melodious under LP. Lata Mangeshkar and Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal shared a long, close and rewarding association. From 1963, to the next 35 years, Lata Mangeshkar and Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal were to chalk up around 712 songs together, which accounted for one in every 10 Hindi film songs recorded by the Melody Queen, and one of every four songs composed by the duo[citation needed]. Their work includes a variety and range; there were chart-slammers and classics, and chaalu numbers as well as connoisseur choices. Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal dominates LATA's voice in \"Sati Savitri\" 1964, \"Lootera\" 1965, \"Intequam\" 1968, \"Sharafat\" 1970, \"Abhinetri\" 1971, \"Mera Gaon Mera Desh\" 1971, \"Jal Bin Machhali Nritya Bin Bijle\" 1971, \"Raja Jani\" 1972, \"Bobby\" 1973,\"Satyam Shivam Sundaram\" and \"Ek Duje Ke Liye\", 1981... all have different variety. Singer Mohammad Rafi has sung as many as 388 songs under the LP. This is the highest number of the songs sung by Mohammad Rafi with any of the music directors in Hindi Film Music. Songs from \"Dosti\",\"Aaye Din Bahar Ke\", \"Aaya Sawan Jhum Ke\", \"Mere Humdam Mere Dost\", \"Jeene Ki Raah\", \"Dharm Veer\", \"Amar Akbar Anthony\" and \"Sargam\" etc. have the dominance from Rafi. Mohammad Rafi played a very important role in the Music Duo's career. Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal started their career with a song of Rafi in the film \"CHHAILA BABU IN 1967\" Rafi Sahab sang for LP for free and blessed them that- \" This music Duo may work together to their last breath\" Therefore, Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal always respected Rafi till the end and Rafi sang his last song-\"TERE AANE KI AAS HAI DOST...\" in music direction of LP which was recorded on 31 July 1980 in Mahboob studio at 10:00 PM. Shortly afterwards Mohd Rafi died. LP also produced some memorable songs rendered by Kishore Kumar, 402 songs, the second highest numbers of the songs sung by Kishore Kumar under any of the music directors in HFM, namely \"Mere Mehboob Quayamat hogi\", \"Pyar Batate Chalo\", Mere Naseeb Main\", \"Ye Dard Bhara Afsana\", Vaada Tera Vaada\", \"Ye Jeevan Hai\", \"Mere Dil Main Aaj Kya Hai\", \"mere Diwane Pan Ki\", \"My Name Is Anthony Gonsalvis\", \"Aap Ke Anurodh Pe\", \"Ik Ritu Aaye\", \"Gadi bula rahi hai\", \"Ruk jana Nahi\" and \"Om Shanti Om\" and many more hits. Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal kept the balancing act between Mohammad Rafi (388 songs) and Kishore Kumar (402 songs). During the peak wave of Kishore Kumar after Aaradhana, it is Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal who gave maximum numbers of the songs to Mohammad Rafi.. In 1977 LP brought back the glory of Mohammad Rafi through, \"Amar Akbar Anthony\" and \"Sargam\".. LP worked with also worked with Mukesh, Asha Bhosle, Manna Dey, Mahendra Kapoor, Amit Kumar, Alka Yagnik, Udit Narayan, Shailender Singh, S.P.Balasubrahmanyam, Anuradha Paudwal. However, they also gave big breaks to many newcomers like, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Mohammed Aziz, Suresh Wadkar, Shabbir Kumar, Sukhwinder Singh, Vinod Rathod, and Roop Kumar Rathod.LP always wanted to engage the voice of Talat Mahmood so they specially composed a very melodious song 'Mohabbat ki Kahaniyan' in 1971 for the film 'Wo Din Yaad Karo\" in which Lata accompanied Talat Sahab. On 7 May 2011, event house Kakas Entertainment arranged a show called Maestros, by Pyarelal where they relived old songs with singers like Sonu Nigam, Alka Yagnik, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Sudesh Bhosle and many other Bollywood singers. Laxmikant -Pyarelal are the only composer who assembled legendary singers Mohammad Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh & Lata Mangeshkar for the song \"Humko Tumse Ho Gaya Hai Pyar Kya Kare\" in Amar Akbar Anthony After Laxmikant's death, Pyarelal has done some work independently. When the playback singer Kumar Sanu turned music director, he approached Pyarelal to arrange music for him. Pyarelal was approached to assist in the music of Farah Khan's Om Shanti Om song \"Dhoom Tana\".In 2009 Pyarelal won the Sachin Dev Burman International Award for Creative Sound and Music at the Pune Film Festival. Pyarelal has done a show with Kakas Entertainment called Maestros A musical Journey of Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal After Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal made debut as a music director duo in 1963, they were nominated for the Filmfare Awards (Best Music Director) almost every year. Many times, they were nominated for three or more numbers of films in a particular year. At the same time LP narrowly missed the awards for musical hits like Aaye Din Bahar Ke, Intquam, Do Raste, Mera Gaon Mera Desh, Shor, Daag, Bobby, Ek Duje Ke Liye, Utsav, Sur Sangam, Farz, Shagird, Tezaab, Hero, and Mr. India.

        "artist_name": "Madan_Mohan_(composer)", 
        "biography": " Madan Mohan Kohli (25 June 1924\u00a0\u2013 14 July 1975), better known as Madan Mohan, was an Indian music director of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. He is particularly remembered for the ghazals he composed for the film industry. He often worked with Lata Mangeshkar, Talat Mahmood and Mohammed Rafi.   Born on 25 June 1924, at Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan, where his father Rai Bahadur Chunilal was working as an Accountant General with the Kurdistan Peshmerga forces, Madan Mohan spent the early years of his life in the Middle East. After 1932, his family returned to their home town of Chakwal, then in Jhelum district of Punjab, British India. He was left in the care of a grandparent while his father went to Bombay to seek business opportunities. He attended local school in Lahore for the next few years. During his stay at Lahore, he learnt the basics of classical music from one Kartar Singh for a very short period, however he never received any formal training in music. Some time later, his family moved to Bombay where he completed his Senior Cambridge from St. Mary's School in Byculla Mumbai. In Bombay, at the age of 11 years, he started performing in children's programmes broadcast by All India Radio. At age 17, he attended the Colonel Brown Cambridge School in Dehradun where he completed a year's training. He joined the Army as a Second Lieutenant in the year 1943. He served there for two years until end of World War II, when he left the Army and returned to Bombay to pursue his musical interests. In 1946, he joined the All India Radio, Lucknow as Programme Assistant, where he came in contact with various artists such as Ustad Faiyaz Khan, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, Begum Akhtar, and Talat Mahmood. During these days he would also compose music for programmes to be broadcast on All India Radio. In 1947, he was transferred to All India Radio, Delhi where he worked for a short period. He was very fond of singing, and so in 1947 he got his first chance to record two ghazals penned by Behzad Lucknawi, Aane Laga Hai Koi Nazar Jalwa Gar Mujhe and Is Raaz Ko Duniya Jaanti Hai. Soon after, in 1948 he recorded two more private ghazals penned by Deewan Sharar, Wo Aaye To Mahfil Mein Ithlaate Huye Aaye and Duniya Mujhe Kahti Hai Ke Main Tujhko Bhoolaa Doon. In 1948, he got his first opportunity to sing a film duet Pinjare Mein Bulbul Bole and Mera Chhotasa Dil Dole with Lata Mangeshkar under composer Ghulam Haider (composer) for the film Shaheed (1948 film), though these songs were never released or used in the film. Between 1948 and 1949, he assisted music composers S.D. Burman for Do Bhai, and Shyam Sundar in Actress and Nirdosh. He scored his first big break with the film Aankhen (1950 film) in 1950. His next film was \"Adaa\" which saw the beginning of a long lasting collaboration with Lata Mangeshkar; who would go on to sing for many of his films. Two of his composed songs from \"Sharabi\" \"Sawan ke maheeney mein\" and the classic song \"Kabhi na Kabhi koi na koi toh aayega\", both filmed for Dev Anand are among the most well known renditions of the renowned singer Mohammad Rafi. In addition, his other compositions like Wo Chup Rahen To from the film Jahan Ara (1964) and Maine Rang Li Aaj Chunariya from Dulhan Ek Raat Ki (1966) are two similar examples. Madan was also able to write songs for male singers such as Talat Mahmood (Phir wahi Sham, wahi dil, wahi tanhayee hai, Main Teri Nazar Ka Suroor Hoon and Teri Aankh Ke Aansoo from Jahan Ara, and Meri Yaad Mein Tum Na from Madhosh) and Mohammad Rafi (Ek Haseen Shaam Ko from Dulhan Ek Raat Ki, Kisi Ki Yaad Mein from Jahan Ara, Main Nigahen Tere Chehere Se from Aap Ki Parchaiyian, Aap Ke Pehlun Mein Aakar Ro Diye from Mera Saaya, the all-time haunting Meri Awaaz Suno and Tumhare Zulf Ke Sayen from Naunihal, Teri Aankhon Ke Siva Duniya Mein from Chiraag as well. Madan did not usually employ Kishore Kumar. Nonetheless their partnership created songs as well; in this category fall songs such as Simti Si, Sharmai Si from Parwana, Zaroorat Hai, Zaroorat Hai from Manmauji, the title song from Ek Muthi Aasman, Mera Naam Abdul Rehman from Bhai Bhai, and Aai Hasino, Naazanino from Chacha Zindabad. Madan often collaborated with lyricists Raja Mehdi Ali Khan, Kaifi Azmi, and Rajinder Krishan, Sahir Ludhianvi and Majrooh Sultanpuri for his movies. In 1957 he came out with a film named Dekh Kabira Roya in which the legendary singer Manna Dey gave his voice to the melodious Kaun Aaya Mere Man Ke Dwaare and unforgettable numbers like Tum Bin Jeevan Kaisa Jeevan in the film Bawarchi. In addition to that, he had Lata sing Tu Pyaar Kare Ya Thukraaye and Meri Veena Tum Bin Roye numbers, and he used Talat Mahmood for the song Hum Se Aaya Na Gaya in the same movie. Once in an interview Manna Dey recalled that Madan Mohan asked him to take special care when singing Kaun Aaya Mere Man Ke Dwaare. A film scored by Madan was Chetan Anand's Haqeeqat (1964), starring Balraj Sahni and Dharmendra and based on the Sino-Indian War of 1962. In it, he used Rafi, who sang numbers like Kar Chale Hum Fida, Main Yeh Soch Kar. Lata was used for the song Zara Si Aahat Hoti Hai and the unscreened \" Khelo na mere dilse\". And the same film saw Rafi, Talat, Manna Dey, and Bhupendra singing Hoke Majboor Mujhe Usne Bhulaya Hoga. Bhupendra appeared on the screen as well for the first time, much before he established himself as a playback singer. This song is also the only song in which four top-rated male playback singers have put voices together in a song. In 1966, he again paired with Lata Mangeshkar for Mera Saaya. Madan Mohan's venture was Raj Khosla's version of \"Woman in White\", titled \"Woh Kaun Thi?\". This film has three Lata solos ('Naina barse rim jhim rim jhim', 'Lag ja gale' and 'Jo humne daastaan apni sunayee') and a Lata duet. The late fifties, sixties and the early seventies were the most productive period in Madan Mohan's career. His songs from those decades include compositions for films like Adalat, Anpadh, Dulhan ek raat ki, Mera Saya, Dastak, Hanste Zakhm, Heer Raanjha, Maharaja, and Mausam, among many others. His second last bow was for a film released five years after his death, Chalbaaz. In 1970, during the changing times of western music he gave music based on ragas for Rajinder Singh Bedi's Dastak and won his only 1971 National Film Award for Best Music Direction. Its songs sung by Lata Mangeshkar are still considered her finest. His legacy wouldn't be complete without mentioning the ghazal he composed for the movie \"Dil Ki Rahein\" - \"Rasm-e-ulfat ko nibhaein to nibhaein kaise\". The shayar(lyricist) for the ghazal was Naqsh Lallayalpuri and it was sung by Lata Mangeshkar. It is considered as one of the best songs sung by Lata Mangeshkar, ever. Madan Mohan's son Sanjeev Kohli recreated 11 of his late father's unused compositions for the soundtrack of the 2004 Yash Chopra film Veer-Zaara. Later on, Kohli brought out an album \"Tere Baghair\" which contains some of Madan Mohan's songs. Lata Mangeshkar christened him \"Ghazal ka Shehzadaa\", or the Prince of Ghazals. Even Lata herself stated in a live concert in the late 1990s that she found Madan Mohan's compositions difficult to master. Most of the top film actors of the day (who were also studio heads) had fallen into a groove with their preferred composers (e.g., Raj Kapoor had Shankar Jaikishan, Dev Anand had the Burmans, Dilip Kumar had Naushad, etc.) Hence, he often had difficulty finding assignments. His 1964 Filmfare Award nomination for Best Music Director for Woh Kaun Thi. In a tightly-contested race, both Madan and Shankar Jaikishan (Sangam) lost to relative newcomers Laxmikant Pyarelal, who scored Dosti. Madan's constant struggles took a toll on his life, and he began drinking heavily. He died of liver cirrhosis on 14 July 1975. In 2004, Madan's unused tunes were recreated by his son, Sanjeev Kohli, for the Yash Chopra film Veer-Zaara, starring Shahrukh Khan, Preity Zinta, and Rani Mukerji. The lyrics were written by Javed Akhtar, and Lata Mangeshkar was invited to once again sing the majority of the melodies composed by him. The music was highly appreciated and got high critical response. He was awarded the IIFA award 2005, for Music Direction for Veer-Zaara. 'Madan Mohan: An Unforgettable Composer\u00a0\u2013 Edited by V M Joshi & Suresh Rao, presents an analytical look at the composer's work. It includes articles by Sanjeev Kohli, Akshay Kohli, O P Dutta, Uttam Singh, B R Ishara, Dr. Ashok Ranade, Alka Deo Marulkar, Mridula Joshi, Dr. Kirti Shrivastava, Deepak Jeswal and many more; interviews with Lata Mangeshkar, Shreya Ghoshal, Mahalaxmi Iyer and Rehana Sultan, and Madan Mohan's filmography. Madan's music was characterised by his immense ability to meld elements of Indian classical music into a new style of Hindi filmi song. He had a keen and sensitive ear for the nuances of Indian classical tunes, and combined them with elements of Western music such as harmonies to produce a style of music that could be appreciated by both classical music aficionados and the common person alike."

In his career spanning six decades, he worked with music directors, from Naushad, Madan Mohan, S.D.Burman, Roshan, Ravi, Shankar-Jaikishan, O.P.Nayyar, Usha Khanna, Laxmikant Pyarelal, Anu Malik, R.D.Burman, Rajesh Roshan, Anand-Milind and Jatin-Lalit, to Leslie Lezz Lewis and A.R.Rahman. He won the Filmfare Best Lyricist Award in 1965 for \"Chahunga Main Tujhe\" in film Dosti, and the highest award in Indian cinema, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for lifetime achievement in 1993. In the 1980s and 1990s, most of his work was with Anand-Milind, their most notable collaborations being Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Lal Dupatta Malmal Ka, Love, Kurbaan and Dahek. He also wrote timeless classics with Jatin-Lalit for films like Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander (including the song Pehla Nasha) and Yaara Dildara (including the song Bin Tere Sanam), which are still heard to this day on the airwaves.   Majrooh Sultanpuri was born as Asrar ul Hassan Khan in a Tarin Pashtun family, in Sultanpur, Uttar Pradesh, where his father was posted in the Police Department in either 1919 or 1920. His father, though, a police officer, was not too keen on his son receiving English education and Majrooh was therefore sent for traditional 'Madrasa education' which led to his obtaining the qualification first of Dars-e-Nizami - a seven-year course which concentrated on religious affairs along with proficiency in Arabic and Persian- and then the certificate of Alim. He thereafter joined Lucknow's Takmeel-ut-Tib College of Unani. He was a struggling Hakim when he happened to recite one of his ghazals at a mushaira in Sultanpur. The ghazal was a hit with the audience and Majrooh decided to drop his fledgling medical practice and began writing poetry seriously. Soon he was a 'regular' at mushairas and a \"shagird\" i.e. disciple of the then top name in Urdu Mushairas viz Jigar Moradabadi. While Majrooh is popular as a film lyricist and is widely known in that capacity, be it known that he also created one of the best-known verses of Urdu poetry, Main akela hee chala tha janibe manzil magar, log saath aate gaye aur carvan banta gaya! (I set off alone towards the destination but people joined in and soon it became a caravan!) In 1945, Majrooh visited Bombay to attend a mushaira at the Saboo Siddique Institute. Here his ghazals and poetry were highly appreciated by the audience. One of the impressed listeners was film producer A.R. Kardar. He contacted Jigar Moradabadi who helped him to meet Majrooh. However, Majrooh refused to write for films because he didn't think very highly of them. But Jigar Muradabadi persuaded him, saying that films would pay well and would help Majrooh to support his family. Kardar then took him to music composer Naushad who put the young writer to test. He gave Majrooh a tune and asked him to write something in the same metre, and Majrooh wrote Jab Usne Gesu Bikhraye, Badal Aaye Jhoom Ke.... Naushad liked what he wrote and Majrooh was signed on as the lyricist of the film Shah Jehan (1946). The songs of the film became so immensely popular that K.L. Saigal wanted Jab Dil Hi Toot Gaya to be played at his funeral. But before he could react to the large-scale appeal created by these lines, he fell ill. The harsh Bombay weather made him leave the city and return to his hometown in the North. Shah Jehan was followed by S. Fazil's Mehndi, Mehboob's Andaaz (1949), and Shahid Latif's Aarzoo. Just as Majrooh was establishing himself as a lyricist and songwriter of repute, his leftist leanings got him into trouble. The government wasn't amused by his anti-establishment poems and he was jailed in 1949 along with other leftists like Balraj Sahni. Majrooh was asked to apologise, but he refused and was sentenced to two years in prison. While he was in prison, his eldest daughter was born. During this time his family experienced considerable financial difficulties. Raj Kapoor commissioned a song (\"Dunia Banane Wale\") from Majrooh for which he paid him Rs. 1000. Majrooh's political beliefs were further manifested when his second daughter married the son of the Urdu writer and socialist Zoe Ansari. Toward the end both Majrooh and Zoe Ansari were disenchanted with the direction socialism had taken in the Soviet Union and China. Their desire to better the lives of the masses found an outlet in their writings. Majrooh went on to write lyrics for popular films throughout the 1956s. Along with Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Majrooh was considered the most notable ghazal writer. Majrooh won his only Filmfare Best Lyricist Award for the song \"Chahunga Mein Tujhe Saanj Savere\" from Dosti. He was also awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1993. He was the first lyricist to win the prestigious award named after Dadasaheb Phalke. Majrooh and Nasir Hussain first collaborated on the film Paying Guest, which Nasir wrote. After Nasir turned director and later producer they went on to collaborate in several films, all of which had huge hits and are some of Majrooh's best remembered works: Majrooh also was instrumental in introducing R.D. Burman to Nasir for Teesri Manzil. The trio worked in 7 of the above-mentioned films. Burman went on to work in 2 more films subsequent to Zamane Ko Dikhana Hai. Majrooh Sultanpuri had a severe attack of pneumonia and died in Bombay on 24 May 2000. He was aged 80 at the time of his death."

        "biography": " Prabodh Chandra Dey Prabodh Chandra Dey (1 May 1919 \u2212 24 October 2013), known by his stage name Manna Dey, was an Indian playback singer. He debuted in the film Tamanna in 1942, by this song \"Upar Gagan Bishal\" composed by his paternal uncle K.C. Dey and went on to record more than 4,000 songs from 1942 to 2013. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri in 1971, the Padma Bhushan in 2005 and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2007. Dey sang in all the major regional Indian languages, though primarily in Hindi and Bengali. His peak period in Hindi playback singing was from 1953 to 1976.   Dey was born to Mahamaya and Purna Chandra Dey on 1 May 1919 in Kolkata. Besides his parents, his youngest paternal uncle, Sangeetacharya Krishna Chandra Dey highly inspired and influenced him. He received his early education in Indu Babur Pathshala, a small pre-primary school. He started doing stage shows in school since 1929.[citation needed] He attended Scottish Church Collegiate School and Scottish Church College. He participated in sports events like wrestling and boxing in his college days, taking training from Gobar Guha. He graduated from Vidyasagar College. Dey began taking music lessons from Krishna Chandra Dey and Ustad Dabir Khan. During this period, he stood first for three consecutive years in three different categories of inter-collegiate singing competitions.[citation needed] In 1942, Dey accompanied Krishna Chandra Dey on a visit to Bombay. There he started working as an assistant music director first under Krishna Chandra Dey, and then under Sachin Dev Burman. Later, he assisted other music composers and then started to work independently. While working independently as a music director for various Hindi movies, Manna Dey continued to take musical lessons in Hindustani classical music from Ustad Aman Ali Khan and Ustad Abdul Rahman Khan. Dey started his career in playback singing with the movie Tamanna, in 1942. The musical score was by Krishna Chandra Dey and Manna sang a duet named \"Jago Aayee Usha Ponchi Boley Jago\" with Suraiya which was an instant hit. But it was only in 1943 that he got his first solo break with Ram Rajya. Incidentally, the producer of the film Vijay Bhatt and its composer Shankar Rao Vyas had approached K C Dey with an offer for playback in the film. When K C Dey refused the offer on the grounds that he would not lend his voice to other actors, they spotted Manna Dey sitting in the corner of the room and offered him the opportunity. Shankar Rao Vyas taught Manna Dey the songs and he chose to sing them in his uncle\u2019s distinct style. And thus started the illustrious career with the first song \u201cGayi tu gayi Seeta sati\u201c(Ram Rajya, 1943). His songs like \"O Prem Diwani Sambhal Ke Chalna\" from 1944 film Kadambari composed by Anil Biswas, \"Dil Churaney Ki Liye from Dur Chaley\" (1946) composed by Jafar Khurshid, his duets with Amira Bahee like \"E Diniya Jara Suney\" from Kamala (1946) and duet song \"Aaj Bor Aayee\" with Meena Kapoor from 1947 film Chaltey Chaltey became chartbusters in respective years. Between 1945-47 many Manna Dey-Rajkumari duets like \"Hay Gagan Me Badal Tharey\" in 1945 for the film Vikaramaditya, \"Aowji Morey\" from Insaaf (1946), all 4 duets from the film Geet Govind composed by Pandit Indra - \"Kit Ho Nando Kumar\", \"Chorr Sakhi Aaj Laj\", \"Apney Hi Rang\", \"Lalit Labang Lata\" from Geet Govind became popular. He sang for first time songs composed by Sachin Dev Burman, Upar Gagan Vishal and Duniya Ke Logo in the 1950 movie Mashal, which became popular and from here his association with S.D.Burman began. Its lyrics were written by Kavi Pradeep. In 1952, Dey sang for a Bengali and a Marathi movie with the same name and storyline, Amar Bhupali. This established him as a leading playback singer in Bengali films and Marathi films as well by 1953. In the post independence period, after 1947, Manna Dey was regularly used by music composers Anil Biswas, Shankar Rao Vyas, S.K.Pal, S.D.Burman, Khem Chand Prakash, Mohd.Safi from 1947 to 1957. Dey-Anil Biswas combination gave hit numbers from films like Gajre (1948), Hum Bhi Insaan Hai (1948), Do Sitaare (1951), Hamdard (1953), Mahatma Kabir (1954),Jasoos (1957) and Pardesi (1957). Though Anil Biswas worked with Dey in very few films, their songs remain famous. He recorded his first duet with Shamshad Begum, who was the Hindi female singer most in demand from 1940-1961, \"Phoolon Ka Swapna\" in the films Girls School (1949) composed by S.K.Pal. His first duet with the then upcoming singer Lata Mangeshkar was \"Lapat Ke Pot Pahaney Bikral\" composed by Vasant Desai for Narsingh Avtar (1949), and with Kishore Kumar it was \"Subaho Ki Paheli Kiran\" from 1951 film Anadolan composed by Pannalal Ghosh. His first duet with Geeta Roy (Dutt) was \"Dhonyo Dhonyo He Ayodh Puri\" from the film Ram Vivah (1949) composed by Shankar Rao Vyas, first duet with Umadevi (Tun Tun) was \"Hay Ye Hain\" from Jangal Ka Jaanwar (1951) composed by Ghantshala. His first duet with the then struggling singer Asha Bhosle was \"O Raat Gayee Fir Din Aya\" from 1953 film Bootpolish. Manna Dey established his verstality between 1948 to 1954 by singing not only the classical based film songs but also singing such film songs which were fusion of Indian classical music and pop music and by giving classical music concerts. His experimentation with western music too produced many unforgettable melodies resulting in an increase in singing offers in films from 1955. He began singing ghazals in Hindi films from 1953. He became a music composer in Hindi films when he composed music along with Khemchand Prakash for both Shri Ganesh Janma (1951) and Vishwamitra (1952). By 1954, Manna Dey became popular among musical circle across film industries of various Indian languages. He became nationally famous after release of Do Bigha Zamin (1953) where two of the songs sung by him and composed by Salil Choudhury became hits. Salil Choudhury worked with Dey from 1953 to 1992 in Hindi films and made Dey sing even in Bengali and Malayalam films right from the late 1950s to early 1990s. His association with Shankar-Jaikishan and producer Raj Kapoor had begun while working for Awara, but their combination became famous while working together for Boot Polish in 1954. The trio worked in many films together from 1954-1971 whose musical scores were appreciated, irrespective of their box-office fate, like Shree 420, Chori Chori, Mera Naam Joker, Parvarish, Dil Hi to hai, Awara, Sriman Satyavadi, Kal Aaj aur Kaal, Abdullah etc.. The Raj Kapoor- Manna Dey combination produced superhits (both music and film, the only exception being Mera Naam Joker where the songs were chartbusters but the film was a flop) and was a pair to reckon with. While Mukesh sang the slow pathos for Raj Kapoor, Manna Dey sang the fast peppy ones, the classical numbers, the romantic duets (in case one analyses Manna Dey has sung more than 95% of Raj Kapoor's superhit duets) and the naughty numbers. Manna Dey has the rare distinction of doing playback for both father and son - Raj Kapoor and Randhir Kapoor (In fact Manna Dey later sang for Rishi Kapoor in Zamane ko dikhana hai). C. Ramchandra worked with Dey very first time in Insaniyaat in 1955 and then recorded songs with Dey consistently even in the 1960s in films like \u2013 Tallaq (1959), Navrang, Paigham, Stree (1961), Veer Bhimsen etc. In 1956, he sang with a new batch of singers. He recorded his first duets with Sudha Malhotra \"Ghar Ghar Deep Jalao Re\" from Ayodhyapati in 1956, with Binata Chatterjee in the duet \"Tum Mile Mil Gaye Karaar\" from Grand Hotel (1956) composed by Suresh Talwar, and then his first duet with Sabita Banerjee in the song \"Jamine Hamari Jamana\" composed by A.R.Quereshi from Laal-E-Yaman (1956) and with singer Meena Kapoor in the song \"Rim Jhim Jhim Rim Jhim\" from Pardesi (1957) composed by Anil Biswas. Dey turned into an independent music composer in Hindi films with Maha Poojaa in 1954. He sang eighty-three Hindi songs in three years from 1953 to 1955 and his demand increased such that he sang 45 songs in the year 1956. His career reached in peak form when he recorded 95 Hindi songs in single year 1957 and 64 in 1958. His peak period in Hindi film industry is considered to be from 1953 to 1969 where he recorded 758 Hindi songs of which 631 came between 1957 and 1969. He worked extensively with other music directors like Naushad, K.Dutta, Vasant Pawar & Ram, Vasant Desai, Ravi, S.K.Pal, Avinash Vyas, S. N. Tripathi, Sanmukh Babu, Nissar Bazmi, Husanlal Bhagatram, B.N. Bali, Sushanta Banerjee, O.P. Nayyar, G.Ramanathan, T.G.Lingappa, Nirmal Kumar, Ghulam Mohhammed, Bipin Dutta, Rabin Banerjee, Roshan, Sapan Jagmohan from 1954 to 1968. New age composers like Kalyanji-Anandji started recording songs with Manna Dey from 1958 and Laxmikant Pyarelal from 1964. Rahul Dev Burman made Manna Dey sing the westernised songs \u2013 \"Aao Twist Karen\" and \"Pyar Karta Ja\" which became chartbusters in 1965. But the composers who gave Manna Dey consistent popular song numbers in commercially successful films from 1955-1969 were S.D.Burman, C.Ramachandra, Ravi, Avinash Vyas, Vasant Desai, Anil Biswas, Salil Choudhury and Shankar Jaikishan. The solo songs sung by Manna Dey like \"Lapak Jhapak Tu Aa Re\" from Boot Polish(1954), \"O Gori Tori Tu Pyar Ka Sagar Hai\" from Seema(1955), \"Yeh Kahani Hai Diye Aur Toofan Ki\" from Diya Aur Toofan (1956) composed by Vasant Desai, \"Humdum Se Gaye\" from Manzil (1960), \"Aye Mere Pyare Watan\" from Kabuliwala (1961), \"Laga Chunari Mein Daag\" from Dil Hi Toh Hai (1963), classical songs like \"Sur Na Saje\" from Basant Bahar (1956), \"Kaun Aya Mere Mann\" from Dekh Kabira Roya (1957), \"Pucho Na Kaise Maine Rain\" from Meri Surat Teri Aankhen (1963), \"Jhanak Jhanak Tore Baje Payalia\" from Mere Huzoor (1965); folk based songs like \"Kisi Chilman Se\" from Baat Ek Raat Ki (1962), \"Ae Meri Zohra Jabeen\" from Waqt (1965), \"Chalat Musafir Moh Liya\" from Teesri Kasam (1967), \"Aao Aao Sawariya\", and duets with Lata like \"Masti Bhara Yeh Sama\" from Parvarish(1958), \"Nain Mile Chain Kahan\" from Basant Bahar(1956), \"Kehdoji Kehdo Chupaona Pyar\" from Kismat Ka Khel (1956), \"Tum Gagan Ke Chandrama\" from Sati Savitri (1964), \"Dil Ki Girah\" from Raat Aur Din (1966), \"Chunari Sambhal Gori\" from Baharon Ke Sapne (1967), were chartbusters in their respective year of release. Credit is also given to Manna Dey for popularising classical based solo and duet songs to the masses like the duet with Lata \u2013 \"Pritam Daras Dikhao\" from Chacha Zindabad (1959), became a popular song though it was based on classical Raag Lalit. His rendition of \"Kasame Vaade Pyar\" from Upkar (1967) pictured on Pran and composed by Kalyanji Anandji won accolades for Dey, and was also significant in Pran\u2019s career as he began to do positive roles. Manna Dey gave playback for Raj Kapoor in Shree 420 (Mud Mud Ke Na Dekh), Chori Chori (Yeh Raat Bheegi, Jahan Main Jati and Aja Sanam), Parvarish (Masti bhara hai sama), Dil Hi To Hai (Laga chunari mein daag), Mera Naam Joker (Ae bhai zara dekh ke chalo) and \"Ek Paon Chal Raha Hai\" from Kal Aaj Aur Kal (1971). R.D.Burman recorded hit songs with Manna Dey regularly from 1965 with films like Bhoot Bangla, Gomti Ke Kinare, Chandan Ka Palna, Baharon Ke Sapne, Padosan, in late 60\u2019s. He sang for Balraj Sahni in many films from 1950 till 1969 and was voice of Mehmood and Anoop Kumar in many films from 1960-1975. Among the new breed of singers which emerged after 1956, Manna Dey's duets with Suman Kalyanpur were popular making them a celebrated team.

Pal in 1952 and their first duet together - \"Subaho Ki Paheli Kiran\" in 1951 from Andolan. In 1968, R.D. Burman brought them together for \"Ek Chatur Naar\" in Padosan. Reportedly the song \"Ek Chatur Naar\" (a duet by Kishore Kumar and Manna Dey) from Padosan (1965) was partly improvised by Kishore Kumar at the time of recording and Manna Dey, determined to show Kishore Kumar how he would sing the duet better (since Kishore had not been trained classically), got into the mood of the song and immortalised \"Ek Chatur Naar\". Dey recorded around 31 songs with Kishore from 1951 to 1987 and all of them became chartbusters. From 1969, after release of Aradhana, the highest in demand playback singer was Kishore Kumar, so careers of Mukesh, Rafi and Manna Dey were affected and they got lesser number of songs to sing. His peak period as a playback singer is considered to be from 1953 to 1969 and in the year 1969 it seemed that Dey\u2019s career in Hindi films would be over due to resurgence of Kishore Kumar but he had an extended peak period till 1976. The song \"Tujhe Suraj Kahun Ya Chanda\" from Ek Phool Do Mali in 1969, S.D. Burman composition \"Mitwa Mitwa Piya Maine Kya Kiya\" from Us Paar (1974) and his duet with Shailendra Singh from Bobby \u2013 \"Na Maangoon Sona Chandi\" were a chartbusters in respective years. His song \"Sawan Ki Rimjhim Main\" was aired in non-film program section in Vividh Bharati and became popular on the radio. He received a fresh lease of life in his playback singing career from 1971 after Rajesh Khanna allowed music directors to picturise or feature songs sung by Dey in films with Khanna in lead role beginning with Anand, composed by Salil Chowdahry. For Rajesh Khanna, Dey had sung songs \"Zindagi kaisi hai paheli\" (Anand, 1971), \"Tum bin jeewan kaisa jeewan\" and \"Bhor Aaye Gaya Andhera\" (Bawarchi, 1972), \"Nadiya Chale Re\" (song sung with Rajesh and Dey), \"Hasne ki chah ne kitna mujhe\" (Avishkaar, 1973) and \"Gori tori paijaniya\" (Mehbooba, 1976). Later in a 2012 interview, Dey said, \"I loved the way he picturised music. The success of a song depends upon how an actor picturises it. He was the number one in picturising songs. I will be ever indebted to him.\" From 1970-1983, he recorded around 503 songs used in Hindi films. Thereafter he became selective of the kinds of songs he sings and chose to do less work in Hindi. The demand for Kishore-Manna Dey combination only grew after 1972. Their popular songs were \"Mere Pyale Mein\" from Aamir Garib (1974), \"Is Ishq Mein Har\" from Mr. Romeo (1974), \"Yeh Dosti\" from Sholay (1975), \"Duniya Me Jeeney\" from Naukri, \"Kamal Hain\" from Karz, \"Phool Chaahiye Na\" from Pyas (1982) and their last duet was in 1986 film Maqqar - \"Tu Hi Mera Sapna\". Salil Chowdhry compositions rendered by Dey from films like Ananad and Anadatta became popular as well. Also the trio of Rafi-Kishore-Manna Dey sang together hits like \"Tujhme Ishwar, Allah Tujhme\" from Nanha Farishta (1969) and \"Band Mutthee\" from Chalti Ka Naam Zindagi (1981). Kishore-Manna Dey together also sang with Asha in many films and famous among them are \"Khan Chacha\" from Dil Deewana (1974), \"Aa Kitni Sundar Jagah\" from Chandi Sona, both composed by R.D. Burman and with Lata in \"Goyakechu Nanche\" from Manoranjan (1974), \"Logo Ke Juban Me Apna\" from Nehla Pe Dehla, both composed by Pancham. Lata and Manna Dey recorded fusion songs, which used both Indian and western instruments. Several such songs included the duets \"Kaanhaa Bole Naa\" and \"Balma Moraa Aanchaar\" for the film Sangat, composed by Salil Chowdhury in 1975, which became very popular and was picturised on Rakesh Pandey and Kajri. The song \"Neela peela hara gulabi\" is a famous Holi song sung by Lata with Dey in Aap Bete (1976). In 1974, Dey sang along with Lata-Kishore in the song \"Goyakechu Nanche\" from Manoranjan (1974) which became a chartbuster in 1974. Manna Dey continued to have hit Hindi songs to his credit from 1971 to 1986, such as \"Dulhan Banungi\" from Who Jo Hasina (1983), composed by Raamlaxman and sung with Lata, \"Aankhon Ka Salaam Lo\" with Lata-Rafi in Samraat, \"Dilwaale Dilwaale\" from Kranti (1981), \"Yaari Hai Imaan\" from Zanjeer, \"Ye Duniya Hey Usi Ko\" sung with Kishore-Usha from Suraksha (1979), \"Tum Besahara Ho To Kisi\" from Anurodh (1977), \"Jo Likha Gaya Hai\" from Umar Qaid (1975), among others. \"Sab Kho Diya Sab Pa Liya\" from Maqqar (1986), composed by Rajesh Roshan was the last duet of Lata-Manna Dey for a Hindi film and was a chartbuster. He worked with composers like Laxmikant Pyarelal, Kamlyanji Anadji, Pancham, Bappi Lahiri, Raam Laxman, Sonik Omi, S. Rajeswar Rao, Ravi, Rajesh Roshan extensively from late 70s to 1990 in Hindi films. However, offers for him to sing solo songs in Hindi films reduced since 1976 gradually and rarely songs sung by him was picturised in the hero. He sang \"Bohey Nirontaro Ananto Anandadhara\" from the album Rabindra Sudha in 1961, and then went on to sing 14 songs composed by Rabindranath Tagore until 2002 in Hindi. He sang title songs of Hindi serials like Hum Hindusthaani (1986), Khari Khari (1984), Aasmaan Se Oonchaa (1997) and Aao Jhoome Gaaye (2001), all composed by Barma Malik.

        "artist_name": "Mohammed_Rafi", 
        "biography": " Mohammed Rafi (24 December 1924 \u2013 31 July 1980) was an Indian playback singer and one of the most popular singers of the Hindi film industry. Rafi was notable for his voice and versatility; his songs ranged from classical numbers to patriotic songs, sad lamentations to highly romantic numbers, qawwalis to ghazals and bhajans. He was known for his ability to mould his voice to the persona of the actor, lip-synching the song on screen in the movie. Between 1950 and 1970, Rafi was the most sought after singer in the Hindi film industry. He received six Filmfare Awards and one National Film Award. In 1967, he was honoured with the Padma Shri award by the Government of India. Rafi is primarily noted for his songs in Hindi, over which he had a strong command. It is believed that he sang about 7,400 songs in many languages. He sang in other Indian languages including Konkani, Bhojpuri, Odia, Punjabi, Bengali, Marathi, Sindhi, Kannada, Gujarati, Telugu, Magahi, Maithili and Urdu. Apart from Indian languages, he also sang songs in English, Farsi, Arabic, Sinhalese, Creole and Dutch.   Mohammed Rafi was the second eldest of six brothers born to Hajji Ali Mohammad. The family originally belonged to Kotla Sultan Singh, a village near present-day Amritsar in Punjab, India. Rafi, whose nickname was Pheeko, began singing by imitating the chants of a fakir in the streets of his native village Kotla Sultan Singh where his family lived. Rafi's father moved to Lahore in 1935, where he ran a men's salon in Noor Mohalla in Bhatti Gate. His elder brother, Mohammad Deen, had a friend, Abdul Hameed, (future brother-in-law), who recognised the talent in Rafi in Lahore and encouraged him to sing. Abdul Hameed later convinced the family elders to let Rafi move to Mumbai; he accompanied him in 1944. Rafi learnt classical music from Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan, Pandit Jiwan Lal Mattoo and Firoze Nizami. His first public performance came at the age of 13, when he sang in Lahore featuring K. L. Saigal. In 1941, Rafi, under Shyam Sundar, made his debut in Lahore as a playback singer in the duet \"Soniye Nee, Heeriye Nee\" with Zeenat Begum in the Punjabi film Gul Baloch (released in 1944) under music director Shyam Sunder. In that same year, Rafi was invited by All India Radio Lahore station to sing for them. He made his Hindi film debut in Gaon Ki Gori in 1945. In 1944, Rafi moved to Mumbai. He and Hameed Sahab rented a ten-by-ten-feet room in the crowded downtown Bhendi Bazar area. Poet Tanvir Naqvi introduced him to film producers including Abdur Rashid Kardar, Mehboob Khan and actor-director Nazeer. Shyam Sunder was in Mumbai and provided the opportunity to Rafi to sing a duet with G. M. Durrani, \"Aji dil ho kaabu mein to dildar ki aisi taisi...,\" for Gaon Ki Gori, which became Rafi's first recorded song in a Hindi film. Other songs followed. Rafi's first song with Naushad was \"Hindustan Ke Hum Hain\" with Shyam Kumar, Alauddin and others, from A. R. Kardar's Pehle Aap (1944). Around the same time, Rafi recorded another song for the 1945 film Gaon Ki Gori, \"Aji Dil Ho Kaaboo Mein\". He considered this song his first Hindi language song. Rafi appeared in two movies. In 1945, he appeared on the screen for the song \"Tera Jalwa Jis Ne Dekha\" in the film Laila Majnu. He sang a number of songs for Naushad as part of the chorus, including \"Mere Sapnon Ki Rani, Roohi Roohi\" with K. L. Saigal from the film Shahjahan (1946). Rafi sang \"Tera Khilona Toota Balak\" from Mehboob Khan's Anmol Ghadi (1946) and a duet with Noor Jehan in the 1947 film Jugnu, \"Yahan Badla Wafa Ka\". After partition, Rafi decided to stay back in India and had the rest of his family flown to Mumbai. Noor Jehan migrated to Pakistan and made a pair with playback singer Ahmed Rushdi. In 1949, Rafi was given solo songs by music directors such as Naushad (Chandni Raat, Dillagi and Dulari) Shyam Sunder (Bazaar) and Husnalal Bhagatram (Meena Bazaar). Besides K. L. Saigal, whom he considered his idol, Rafi was also influenced by G. M. Durrani. In the early phase of his career, he often followed Durrani's style of singing, but later evolved with his own, unique style. He sang with Durrani in some of the songs such as \"Humko Hanste Dekh Zamana Jalta Hai\" and \"Khabar Kisi Ko Nahiin, Woh Kidhar Dekhte\" (Beqasoor, 1950). In 1948, after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, the team of Husanlal Bhagatram-Rajendra Krishan-Rafi had overnight created the song \"Suno Suno Ae Duniyawalon, Bapuji Ki Amar Kahani\". He was invited by the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, to sing at his house. In 1948, Rafi received a silver medal from Jawaharlal Nehru on Indian Independence Day. In his early career, Rafi associated with many contemporary music directors, most notably Naushad Ali. In the late 1950s and 1960s, he worked with other composers of the era such as O. P. Nayyar, Shankar Jaikishan, S.D. Burman and Roshan. As per Naushad, Rafi came to him with a letter of recommendation from Naushad's father. Rafi's first song for Naushad was \"Hindustan Ke Hum Hain\" (\"We belong to Hindustan\") for the film Pehle Aap in 1944. The first song for the duo was the soundtrack of the movie Anmol Ghadi (1946). Before Rafi, Naushad's favourite singer was Talat Mahmood. Once Naushad found Talat smoking during a recording. He was annoyed and hired Rafi to sing all the songs of the movie Baiju Bawra. Rafi's association with Naushad helped the former establish himself as one of the most prominent playback singers in Hindi cinema. Songs from Baiju Bawra (1952) like \"O duniya ke rakhwale\" and \"Man tarpat hari darshan ko aaj\" furthered Rafi's credentials. Rafi ended up singing a total of 149 songs (81 of them solo) for Naushad. In the 1960 film Mughal-E-Azam, Mohammed Rafi sang \"Ae Mohabbat Zindabad\", composed by Naushad, with a chorus of 100 singers. S.D.Burman used Rafi as a singing voice of Dev Anand and Guru Dutt. Rafi worked with Burman in 37 movies, including Pyaasa (1957), Kaagaz Ke Phool (1959), Kala Bazar, Nau Do Gyaran, Kala Pani Tere Ghar Ke Samne (1963), Guide (1965), Aradhana (1969), and Abhimaan (1973). Rafi's partnership with Shankar Jaikishan was among the most famous and successful in the Hindi film industry. Under Shankar-Jaikishan, Rafi produced some of his songs for actors like Shammi Kapoor and Rajendra Kumar. Out of six Filmfare awards, Rafi won three for S-J songs \u2013 \"Teri Pyari Pyari Surat Ko\", \"Baharon Phool Barsao\", and \"Dil Ke Jharokhe Mein\". The song \"Yahoo! Chahe Koi Mujhe Junglee Kahe\" was sung by Rafi, only to be matched a fast-paced orchestra and a composition by Shankar Jaikishan. S-J made Rafi give playback for Kishore Kumar in the film Shararat (\"Ajab hai daastan teri yeh zindagi\"). Rafi sang a total of 341 numbers (216 solo) for Shankar-Jaikishan. Among the films of this combination are Basant Bahar, Professor, Junglee, Suraj, Brahmachari, An Evening in Paris, Dil Tera Deewana, Yakeen, Prince, Love in Tokyo, Beti Bete, Dil Ek Mandir, Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai, Gaban and Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai. Rafi got his first Filmfare Award for the title song of Chaudhvin Ka Chand (1960), composed by Ravi. He received National Award for the song \"Babul Ki Duaen Leti Ja\" from the film Neel Kamal (1968), also composed by Ravi. Rafi wept during the recording of this song. He admitted this in his interview to the BBC in 1977. Ravi and Rafi produced several other songs in the films China Town (1962), Kaajal (1965), and Do Badan (1966). Madan Mohan was another composer whose favourite singer was Rafi. Rafi's first solo with Madan Mohan in Ankhen (1950) was \"Hum Ishq Mein Barbad Hain Barbad Rahenge\". They teamed up to produce many songs including \"Teri Aankhon Ke Siva\", \"Yeh Duniya Yeh Mehfil\", \"Tum Jo Mil Gaye Ho\", \"Kar Chale Hum Fida\" and \"Meri Awaz Suno\". Rafi and O. P. Nayyar (OP) created music in the 1950s and 1960s. O. P. Nayyar was once quoted as saying \"If there had been no Mohd. Rafi, there would have been no O. P. Nayyar\". He and Rafi created many songs together including \"Yeh Hai Bombay Meri Jaan\". He got Rafi to sing for singer-actor Kishore Kumar \u2013 \"Man Mora Baawara\" for the movie Raagini. Later, Rafi sang for Kishore Kumar in movies such as Baaghi, Shehzaada and Shararat. O. P. Nayyar used Rafi and Asha Bhosle for most of his songs. The team created many songs in the early 1950s and 1960s for movies such as Naya Daur (1957), Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957), and Kashmir Ki Kali (1964). Rafi sang a total of 197 numbers (56 solo) for Nayyar. The songs \"Jawaaniyan yeh mast mast\" and the title song \"Yun to humne lakh hansee dekhe hain, tumsa nahin dekha\" of the film Tumsa Nahin Dekha were hits. They were followed by songs like \"Taareef karoon kya uski jisne tumhe banaya\" from Kashmir ki Kali. Rafi and OP had a fallout during the recording for movie \"Sawan ki Ghata\". As disclosed by OP during one of his interviews; Rafi reported late to the recording stating that he was stuck in Shankar Jaikishan's recording. OP then stated that from now on he too did not have the time for Rafi and cancelled the recording. They did not work together for the next 3 years. The composer duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal (L-P) patronised Rafi as one of their singers, right from their very first song by him from the film, Parasmani (1963). Rafi and L-P won the Filmfare Awards for the song \"Chahoonga Main Tujhe Saanjh Savere\" from Dosti (1964). Rafi rendered the maximum number of songs for the music director duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal: 369 numbers (186 solo) for L-P. Once, when composer Nisar Bazmi (who had migrated to Pakistan) didn't have enough money to pay him, Rafi charged a fee of one rupee and sang for him. He also helped producers financially. As Laxmikant (of the Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo) once observed \u2013 \"He always gave without thinking of the returns\". Rafi associated with several of his contemporaries, singing duets with them and sometimes for them (as in case of Kishore Kumar who was also an actor). Rafi sang the maximum number of duets with Asha Bhonsle (female), Manna Dey (male) and Lata Mangeshkar (female). In the song \"Humko Tumse Ho Gaya Hai Pyaar Kya Karein\" (Amar, Akbar, Anthony), Rafi sang one song with Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar and Mukesh,the most legendary singers in Bollywood. This was probably the only time that all of them rendered their voices for one song. Rafi sang several hit songs in Chris Perry's Konkani album Golden Hits with Lorna Cordeiro. Rafi recorded Hindi songs in English on 7\" release in 1968. He also sang a song in Creole while on his visit to Mauritius in the late 1960s. Rafi recorded two English albums as well. One of them is Pop Hits. In 1962\u20131963, the popular female playback singer Lata Mangeshkar raised the issue of playback singers' share in the royalties. Recognizing Rafi's position as the leading male playback singer, she wanted him to back her in demanding a half-share from the 5 percent song royalty that the film's producer conceded to select composers. Lata's contention was that, there was no way producers and music directors could deny this singing duo, the royalty. Rafi stated that his claim on the filmmaker ended with his being paid his agreed fee for the song. After that, if the film proved a hit, the filmmaker was welcome to keep the Gramco (HMV) royalty he earned from it. If it did not prove to be a hit, argued Rafi, that he had already been paid the same fees for his song; so later the situation is resolved. Rafi stated that it is the producer who bets the money and the composer who creates the song, so his claim to the contribution of the song is compensated when the fees are paid. Lata viewed his stand as a stumbling block on the royalty issue and stated that it is because of the singer's name also that the records get sold. This difference of opinion subsequently led to differences between the two. During the recording of \"Tasveer Teri Dil Mein\" (Maya, 1961), Lata argued with Rafi over a certain passage of the song. Rafi felt belittled, as music director Salil Chowdhury sided with Lata. The situation worsened when Lata declared that she would no longer sing with Rafi. Rafi stated that he was only so keen to sing with Lata as she was with him. The music director Jaikishan later negotiated a reconciliation between the two. In an interview given to The Times of India on September 25, 2012, Lata claimed to have received a written apology from Rafi. However, Shahid Rafi, Mohammad Rafi's son, rebuffs the claim, calling it an act to dishonor his father's reputation. In the early 1970s, Rafi recorded fewer songs. At the same period Kishore Kumar's popularity increased due to the songs he sang for the film Aradhana. The music for Aradhana was composed by S. D. Burman, and he had used Rafi as the male playback voice for the first two recorded duets, \"Baaghon Mein Bahaar Hai\" and \"Gunguna Rahen Hain Bhanwre\". During 1971\u20131973, Rafi's musical output decreased; however, he did sing several songs. Some of Rafi's songs of the early 1970s were with music directors like Laxmikant-Pyarelal, Madan Mohan, R.D. Burman and S. D. Burman. These include \"Tum Mujhe Yun Bhula Na Paoge\" (a signature song of Rafi in 1971) from Pagla Kahin Ka; \"Yeh Duniya Yeh Mehfil\" from Heer Ranjha (1970); \"Kaan Mein Jhumka\" from Sawan Bhadon; \"Jhilmil Sitaron ka\" from Jeevan Mrityu (a duet with Lata Mangeshkar, 1970); \"Gulabi Aankhen\" from The Train (1970); \"Yunhi Tum Mujhse Baat\" from Sachaa Jhutha; \"Yeh Jo Chilman Hain\" and \"Itna to Yaad Hain Mujhe\" from Mehboob Ki Mehndi (1971); \"Mera Mann Tera Pyasa\" Gambler; \"Chadti Jawani\" from Caravan; \"Chalo Dildar Chalo\" from 1972 released Pakeezah; \"Chura Liya Hai Tumne\" from Yaadon Ki Baarat (a duet with Asha Bhosle, 1973); \"Na Tu Zameen Ke Liye\" from 1973 released Dilip Kumar movie Dastan; \"Tum Jo Mil Gaye Ho\" from Hanste Zakhm (1973); \"Teri Bindiya Re\", from Abhimaan (1973) and \"Aaj Mausam Bada Beimaan Hai\" from Loafer (1973). Kitna pyaar a Wada ,\"Carvan\"(1971) Rafi made a comeback as a leading singer in 1974. That year, he won the Film World magazine Best Singer Award for the song \"Teree Galiyon Mein Na Rakhenge Qadam Aaj Ke Baad\" (Hawas, 1974) composed by Usha Khanna. In 1977, he won both Filmfare Award and the National Award for the song \"Kya Hua Tera Wada\" from the movie Hum Kisise Kum Naheen, composed by R.D. Burman. Rafi sang for Rishi Kapoor in films like Laila Majnu (for which music was given by two composers Madan Mohan, and after his death by Jaidev), Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), Sargam (1979) and Karz (1980). The qawwali \"Pardah Hai Pardah\" from Amar Akbar Anthony (1977) was a superhit. Rafi's notable renderings in the late 1970s and early 1980s include Bairaag (1976), Laila Majnu (1976), Apnapan (1978), Suhaag (1979), Qurbani, Dostana (1980), The Burning Train (1980), Naseeb (1981), Abdullah (1980), Shaan (1980), Aasha (1980), Aap To Aise Na The (1980), and Zamane Ko Dikhana Hai (1982). In 1978 Rafi gave a performance at the Royal Albert Hall and in 1980 he performed at Wembley conference centre. From 1970 he toured the world extensively giving concert performances to packed halls. In December 1979, Rafi recorded six songs for the Hindi remake of Dilip Sen's Bengali superhit Sorry Madam; the film was never completed due to a personal tragedy in Dilip Sen's life. These songs, written by Kafeel Aazar and composed by Chitragupta, were released digitally in December 2009 by the label Silk Road under the title \"The Last Songs\". The physical album was released only in India by Universal.[citation needed] During his last years, Rafi was involved in a controversy over Lata Mangeshkar's entry in the Guinness Book of World Records. In a letter dated 11 June 1977 to the Guinness Book of World Records, Rafi had challenged the claim that Lata Mangeshkar has recorded the maximum number of songs (\"not less than 25,000\" according to Guinness). After receiving a reply from Guinness, in a letter dated 20 November 1979, he wrote, \"I am disappointed that my request for a reassessment vis-a-vis Ms Mangeshkar's reported world record has gone unheeded.\" In an interview to BBC recorded in November 1977, Rafi claimed to have sung 25,000 to 26,000 songs till then. After Rafi's death, in its 1984 edition, the\u00a0Guinness Book of World Records gave Lata Mangeshkar's name for the \"Most Recordings\" and stated, \"Mohammad Rafi (d 1 August 1980) [sic] claimed to have recorded 28,000 songs in 11 Indian languages between 1944 and April 1980.\" According to the available figures, Rafi has sung 4,516 Hindi film songs, 112 non-Hindi film songs, and 328 private (non-film) songs from 1945 to 1980. The Guinness Book entries for Rafi and Lata were removed in 1991. In 2011, Lata's sister Asha Bhosle was given the title. Mohammed Rafi died at 10:25\u00a0pm on 31 July 1980, following a massive heart attack. His last song was for the movie Aas Paas, which he had recorded with Laxmikant-Pyarelal. According to one source, the song was \"Shaam Phir Kyun Udaas Hai Dost / Tu Kahin Aas Paas Hai Dost\". Another source says that the song was a duet with Lata Mangeshkar: \"Shehr mein charcha hai, Yeh duniya kehti hai\". Rafi was buried at the Juhu Muslim cemetery. The government of India announced a two-day public holiday in his honour. In 2010, Rafi's tomb along with many film industry artists such as Madhubala, was demolished to make space for new burials. Fans of Mohammed Rafi, who visit his tomb twice a year to mark his birth and death anniversaries, use the coconut tree that is nearest his grave as a marker. Singers like Shreya Ghoshal, Sonu Nigam, Mahendra Kapoor, Shabbir Kumar, Mohammed Aziz and Udit Narayan were influenced by Rafi's style of singing. Anwar (singer) also imitated Rafi's voice. On 22 September 2007, a shrine to Rafi designed by artist Tasawar Bashir was unveiled on Fazeley Street, Birmingham, UK. Bashir is hoping that Rafi will attain sainthood as a result. The Padma Shri Mohammed Rafi Chowk in the Bandra suburb of Mumbai and Pune (extending MG Road) is named after Rafi. In the summer of 2008, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra released a double CD titled Rafi Resurrected comprising 16 songs by Rafi. Bollywood playback singer Sonu Nigam provided the vocals for this project and toured with the CBSO in July 2008 at venues including the English National Opera in London, Manchester's Apollo Theatre and Symphony Hall, Birmingham. In June 2010, Rafi along with Lata Mangeshkar was voted the most popular playback singer in the Outlook Music Poll, conducted by Outlook magazine. The same poll voted \"Man re, tu kahe na Dheer Dhare\" (Chitralekha, 1964), sung by Rafi as the No. 1 song. Three songs were tied for the No. 2 place: Two were sung by Rafi. The songs were \"Tere Mere Sapne Ab Ek Rang Hain\" (Guide, 1965) and \"Din Dhal Jaye, hai raat na jaye\" (Guide, 1965). This poll was published in Outlook. The jury included people in the Indian music industry: Abhijeet, Adesh Srivastava, Alisha Chinai, Anu Malik, Ehsaan, Gulzar, Hariharan, Himesh Reshammiya, Jatin, Javed Akhtar, Kailash Kher, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Khayyam, Kumar Sanu, Lalit, Loy, Mahalaxmi Iyer, Mahendra Kapoor, Manna Dey, Prasoon Joshi, Rajesh Roshan, Sadhna Sargam, Sameer, Sandesh Shandilya, Shaan, Shankar, Shantanu Moitra, Shreya Ghoshal, Sonu Nigam and Talat Aziz. In an article in Times of India, Rafi is described as \"a versatile singer, who could render classical, rock and roll, indeed any kind of song with ease, he was Hindi film's, favourite male voice through the 1950s and 1960s\". Music director Rajesh Roshan, who composed some of the songs with Rafi, remembers him as \"a warm-hearted simple person with no ego\". There have been appeals to the Government of India to honour the singer, posthumously, with the Bharat Ratna (India's Highest Civilian Award). Classical and playback singer Manna Dey, who was also a contemporary of Rafi said, \"Rafi and I could sing everything, and he was such a gentleman. He was a better singer than me, and I will say this \u2013 that no one came even close to him! He deserved everything he got! We had a great understanding and it was never about one-upmanship\". Veteran actor Shammi Kapoor said, \"I am incomplete without Mohammad Rafi. I used to often go for the recording of my song, which was sung by Mohammad Rafi, only because I used to like telling him how I would perform on this song on screen so that he can sing it that way. Even he liked my involvement\". Over 9,000 musical tributes were organised in July 2011 commemorating the 31st anniversary of the singer's death. A documentary about Rafi's life is under production by the Films Division of India. Rafi's Baharon Phool Barsao was voted the most popular Hindi song in a BBC Asia Network poll commemorating 100 years of Hindi Cinema. In a CNN-IBN survey in 2013, he was voted the greatest voice of Hindi Cinema. In 2001 - Rafi was honored with the \"best singer of the millennium\" by Hero Honda and Stardust magazine in Mumbai on Jan 7, 2001. http://www.filmibeat.com/celebs/mohammed-rafi/awards.html Mohammed Rafi Academy was launched in Mumbai on 31 July 2010 on the 30th anniversary of the singer's death, started by his son Sahid Rafi to impart training in Indian classical and contemporary music. After his death, seven Hindi movies were dedicated to Rafi: Allah Rakha, Mard, Coolie, Desh-Premee, Naseeb, Aas-Paas and Heeralal-Pannalal.[citation needed] Rafi is one of the recording artists mentioned in the 1997 hit British alternative rock song \"Brimful of Asha\" by Cornershop. Rafi's song from the film Gumnaam (1965), \"Jaan Pehechan Ho\", was used on the soundtrack of Ghost World (2001). The film opens with the lead character dancing around in her bedroom to a video of Gumnaam. The song has also been used for Heineken's 2011 \"The Date\" commercial. His \"Aaj Mausam Bada Beiman Hai\" is featured in the 2001 film Monsoon Wedding. His \"Kya Mil Gaya\" (Sasural, 1961) has been used in The Guru (2002), where Ramu and Sharonna sing a version of the song. His song \"Mera Man Tera Pyasa\" (Gambler, 1970) has been used as one of the soundtracks in the Jim Carrey-Kate Winslet starrer Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). This song is played in the background in Kate Winslet's character's home while the lead pair are having a drink (at approximately 00.11.14 runtime). Rafi married twice; his first marriage was to his cousin; Bashira and took place in his ancestral village. The marriage ended when his first wife refused to live in India following the killing of her parents during the riots of Partition of India and moved to Lahore, Pakistan. Rafi had four sons and three daughters; his first son Saeed was from his first marriage. Mohd Rafi won four national awards Babul ki duaye leti ja from Neel kamal Baharon phool barsao from Suraj Choudvin ka chand ho from Choudvin ka chand"

He was the sixth in a family of ten children. The music teacher who came home to teach Mukesh's sister, Sundar Pyari, found a pupil in Mukesh, who would listen from the adjoining room. Mukesh left school after the 10th grade and worked briefly for the Department of Public Works. He experimented with voice recordings during his employment in Delhi and gradually developed his singing abilities and also his musical instrumental skills. Mukesh's voice was first noticed by Motilal, a distant relative, when he sang at his sister's wedding. Motilal took him to Mumbai and arranged for singing lessons by Pandit Jagannath Prasad. During this period Mukesh was offered a role as an actor-singer in a Hindi film, Nirdosh (1941). His first song was \"Dil Hi Bujha Hua Ho To\" as an actor-singer for Nirdosh. He got his break as a playback singer for actor Motilal in 1945 with the film Pehli Nazar with music composed by Anil Biswas and lyrics written by Aah Sitapuri. The first song that he sang for a Hindi film was \"Dil Jalta Hai To Jalne De\". Mukesh was such a fan of singer K. L. Saigal that in his early years of playback singing he used to imitate his idol. In fact, it is said that when K. L. Saigal first heard the song \"Dil Jalta Hai...\", he remarked, \"That's strange, I don't recall singing that song\". Mukesh created his own singing style with the help of music director Naushad Ali, who helped Mukesh to come out of his Saigal style and create his own style. Naushad gave him songs for the film Andaz. Initially Mukesh was the ghost voice of Dilip Kumar in this movie and Mohammed Rafi sang for Raj Kapoor. He delivered many Hits for Naushad in films like: Anokhi Ada (1948), Mela (1948), Andaz (1949). Other composers who used Mukesh voice for great Dilip Kumar in Hit songs like Jeevan Sapna toot gaya were Anil Biswas in Anokha Pyar, Ye Mera Diwanapan hai, Shankar-Jaikishan in Yahudi and Suhana Safar and Dil Tadap Tadap ke, Salil Choudhary in Madhumati. However, later Dilip Kumar choose Rafi as his ghost voice and Mukesh became the ghost voice of Raj Kapoor. In 1974, Mukesh received National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the song \"Kai Baar Yuhi Dekha Hai\" from Rajnigandha (1974), and Filmfare Awards for the songs \"Sab Kuch Seekha Humne\" in the movie Anari (1959), \"Sabse Bada Naadan Wahi Hai\" in Pehchaan (1970), \"Jai Bolo Beimaan Ki\" in Beimaan (1972) and \"Kabhi Kabhie Mere Dil Mein\", the title song of film Kabhie Kabhie (1976). A total of around 1,300 songs were sung by him. This number is less than those sung by some of his contemporaries, but the fact is that Mukesh emphasised on quality rather than quantity. The comparatively fewer songs sung by him in the 1970s can be attributed to both the Kishore wave and his failing health due to his worsening heart problem. Mukesh sang many songs for Kalyanji Anandji music director duo. Mukesh sang more songs with the K-A duo than any other composer. From \"Naina hai jadoo bhare...\" Bedard Zamana Kya Jane (1958) composed by Kalyanji alone as Kalyanji Virji Shah, and \"Main hoon mast madari...\" Madari (1959) as the first Kalyanji-Anandji-Mukesh combo, to \"Chahe aaj mujhe napasand karo...\" Darinda/ 1977, the K-A, Mukesh combination gave numerous popular songs like \"Chhalia mera naam...\", \"Mere toote hue dil se...\", \"Dum dum diga diga\" Chalia(1959), \"Mujhko iss raat ki tanhai mein...\" Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere (1960), \"Hum chhod chale hain mehfil ko...\" (Ji Chahta Hai), \"Humne tumko pyar kiya hai jitna...\" (Dulha Dulhan), \"Chal mere dil lehraake chal...\" Ishara and \"Dheere se chalo...\" Johar Mehmood in Goa,\"Main to ek khwab hoon...\" and \"Chand si mehbooba ho...\" Himalay Ki Godmein(1965),\"Waqt kartaa jo wafaa...\" Dil Ne Pukara,\"Deewanon se yeh mat poocho...\" Upkar, \"Khush raho har khushi hai...\" Suhaag Raat and \"Humsafar ab yeh safar kat jaayega...\" Juari, \"Chandi ki deewaar...\" and \"Le chal le chal mere jeevan saathi...\" Vishwas (1969), \"Koi jab tumhara hriday tod de...\" Purab Aur Paschim, \"Darpan ko dekha...\" Upaasna, \"Jo tumko ho pasand...\" Safar and \"Mujhe nahin poochni tumse beeti baatein...\" Anjaan Raahein (1970). Out of the numerous songs he gave his voice to,Kahin door jab din dhal Jaaye from Anand(1971),Ek Pyaar ka Nagma hai from Shor(1972),Maine Tere Liye Hi Saat Rang Ke from Anand(1972),Sab Kuch Seekha Humne from Anari(1959),Jeena yahan marna yahan and Kehta hai Joker from Mera Naam Joker(1970) are the most popular among his fans and followers Mukesh started his career as an actor singer in the film 'Nirdosh' in 1941, with Nalini Jaywant as his heroine. His second film was 'Adab Arz' in 1943. He played a guest role in Raj Kapoor's film 'Aah' in 1953. He acted as a hero in the film 'Mashooka' in 1953, opposite Suraiya and in the film 'Anurag' (1956} (he was also the co-producer and composer in the film), opposite Usha Kiran and Mridula. Mukesh also produced a film \" Malhar \" (1951) with hero Arjun & heroine Shammi under \"Darling Film\" .  Mukesh married Saral Trivedi alias Bachhiben, daughter of Raichand Trivedi. Saral's father was a Gujarati Brahmin millionaire. With no proper house, an erratic income and what was then considered in India a supposedly \"immoral\" profession (singer in movies), the consent of Saral's father for this marriage could not be obtained and Mukesh and Saral were forced to elope. They got married in a temple in Kandivali on 22 July 1946, Mukesh's 23rd birthday, with the help of the actor Motilal and from the residence of R. D. Mathur. Everyone made dire predictions of unhappy days and divorce, but both weathered the lean days and celebrated their thirtieth wedding anniversary on 22 July 1976, four days before his departure for the USA The couple had five children \u2013 Rita, the singer Nitin, Nalini (d. 1978), Mohnish and Namrata (Amrita). The actor Neil Nitin Mukesh is a grandson of Mukesh (son of Nitin).[citation needed] Mukesh died of a heart attack on 27 August 1976 in Detroit, Michigan, US, where he had gone to perform in a concert. That morning, he got up early and went to take a shower. He came out panting and complaining of chest pains. He was rushed to a hospital but was pronounced dead. The rest of the concert was completed by Lata Mangeshkar and surprisingly his son Nitin Mukesh . His body was flown to India by Lata Mangeshkar, where a grand funeral ceremony was held in the presence of several actors, with personalities of the Indian film industry and fans paying tribute. When news of his death reached Raj Kapoor, he burst into tears, and remarked, \"I have lost my voice,\"[citation needed] which is a testimony to the association of Mukesh's voice (in playback) to the immensely popular songs of Raj Kapoor's films. A famous song of the 50's featured on Bharat Bhushan Aa laut ke aa ja mere meet is another example of his earlier melodies, as is Dil tadap tadapke keh raha hai, picturised on Dilip Kumar. After Mukesh's death, his newer, hitherto unreleased, songs were released in 1977 in films such as Dharam Veer, Amar Akbar Anthony, Khel khiladi ka, Darinda and Chandi sona. The year 1978 also featured a considerable number of Mukesh's songs in films such as Aahuti, Paramatma, Tumhari kasam and Satyam Shivam Sundaram, where Mukesh sang his last film song Chanchal sheetal nirmal komal for Raj Kapoor's younger brother, Shashi Kapoor. From 1980 onward, Mukesh's voice was heard in many later released films such as Shaitan mujarim, Premika, Patthar se takkar (1980), Sanjh ki bela, Maila anchal (1981), Aarohi (1982), Chor mandali (1983), Nirlaj (1985), Love and God (1986), Shubh chintak (1989), and his last known release of Chand grahan (1997) ).

        "artist_name": "Naushad", 
        "biography": " Naushad Ali (25 December 1919 \u2013 5 May 2006) was an Indian musician. He was the foremost music directors for Hindi films and is particularly known for popularizing the use of classical music in films. His first film as an independent music director was Prem Nagar in 1940. His first musical success film was Rattan (1944), following it up with 35 silver jubilee hits, 12 golden jubilee and 3 diamond jubilee mega successes. Naushad was conferred the Dadasaheb Phalke Award and the Padma Bhushan in 1982 and 1992 respectively for his contribution to the Bollywood film industry.   Naushad was born and raised in Lucknow, a city with a long tradition as a center of Indian Muslim culture. His father, Wahid Ali, was a munshi (court clerk). As a child, Naushad would visit the annual fair at the Deva Sharif in Barabanki, 25\u00a0km from Lucknow, where all the great qawwals and musicians of those days would perform before the devotees. He studied Hindustani music there under Ustad Ghurbat Ali, Ustad Yusuf Ali, Ustad Babban Saheb and others. He also repaired harmoniums. As a lad, he joined a junior theatrical club and was appointed the club's music maestro for their theatrical presentations. He used to watch silent films at the Royal theatre in Lucknow. Theatre owners would hire a team of musicians to play the tabla, harmonium, sitar and violin. The musicians would watch the film first, make notes, finalize the scales required. When the show began in the evening, they would sit in front of the screen and play music for the scenes. This was a great way to be entertained and learn music at the same time. It made him grasp the nuances required in composing a film's background music score. In time Naushad formed his own Windsor Music Entertainers or just Windsor Entertainers, so named because he had seen the word \"Windsor\" around Lucknow and liked its ring. It led to the Indian Star Theatrical Company in a theatre at Golaganj colony in Lucknow. He was trained under Laddan Khan until he became capable of working independently as a composer. There he also developed the sense to pick rare musical jewels from the folk tradition of Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Saurashtra during the company's sojourns in those regions. The travelling players got as far as Viramgam in Gujarat, where they discovered penury, even after selling off theatrical props and musical instruments. The company limped back to Lucknow through the kindness of one of Naushad's friends. Naushad had already become a cinema fan in the silent era and then, in 1931, Indian cinema got voice and music that further fascinated the 13-year-old boy. But his family was strict follower of Islamic diktat of prohibition of music and his father gave him ultimatum to leave music if he wanted to stay at home. He ran away to Mumbai in the late 1937 to try his luck as a musician. In Mumbai, he initially stayed with an acquaintance from Lucknow (U.P.) at Colaba and after a while, shifted to Dadar opposite the Broadway theatre where he would sleep on the footpath. He assisted music director Ustad Jhande Khan who was at the peak of his success those days, at a monthly salary of Rs 40. The producer was a Russian and the studio was at Chembur. The film could not be completed. Naushad was a piano player so he worked as a pianist in composer Ustad Mushtaq Hussain's orchestra. He then polished off an unfinished film score and got a credit as assistant to Hussain. Then the film company collapsed. Composer Khemchand Prakash took him on as his assistant for the film Kanchan at Ranjit Studios at a salary of Rs 60 per month, for which Naushad remained extremely grateful and in interviews, he had called Khemchand his guru. His friend, lyricist D. N. Madhok, trusted Naushad's unusual talent for composing music and introduced him to various film producers. Chandulal Shah, the owner of Ranjit Studios, offered to sign Naushad for one of his forthcoming films. Naushad composed a thumri for this film, \"Bata de koi kaun gali gaye Shyam\", but the film never got on the floors. He was assistant music director for the Punjabi film Mirza Sahib (1939). He composed for his first independent film Prem Nagar in 1940 that had a story set in Kutch for which he did a lot of research into the folk music of the area. With A.R. Kardar's film Nayi Duniya (1942), he got first credit as \"music director\" and he began to work regularly for Kardar Productions. He however had a flexibility that he could work outside Kardar Productions and this arrangement continued ever after. He first got noticed with A.R. Kardar's film Sharda (1942) wherein 13-year-old Suraiya debuted with the song \"Panchhi Ja\" for the playback for heroine Mehtab. It was Rattan (1944) that took Naushad right to the top and enabled him to charge Rs 25,000 a film during those days. Film expert and author Rajesh Subramanian opines that Kardar production spent Rupees seventy five thousand in 1944 to make Rattan. The music by Naushad saheb was such a phenomenal hit that the company earned Rs 3 lacs as royalty from gramophone sales in the first year. But his Lucknow-based family remained against music and Naushad had to hide from his family the fact that he composed music. When Naushad got married, the band was playing the tunes of the super hit songs of Naushad's film 'Rattan'. While Naushad's father and father-in-law were condemning the musician who had composed these songs, Naushad dared not tell them that it was he who had composed the music. From 1942 until the late 1960s, he was one of the top music directors in Hindi films. While he did less than a hundred films during his lifetime, 26 of those films celebrated Silver jubilees (25 weeks run) \u2013 8 celebrated golden jubilees (50 weeks run) and 4 celebrated diamond jubilees (60 weeks run). (inclusive count \u2013 a diamond jubilee film also celebrated Silver and Golden jubilee) Naushad worked with several lyricists, including Shakeel Badayuni, Majrooh Sultanpuri, D. N. Madhok, Zia Sarhadi, and Khumar Barabankvi. Mother India (1957), for which he had composed music, was the first Indian film that got nominated for Oscar. In 1981, Naushad was awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for his lifetime contribution to Indian cinema. He composed the tunes of Taj Mahal: An Eternal Love Story (2005) at the age of 86. Amongst his assistants, Mohammed Shafi, Jerry Amaldev and Ghulam Mohammed stand out prominently. Five films have been made on his life and work. Biographical books published are Dastaan-E-Naushad (Marathi) by Shashikant Kinikar; Aaj Gaawat Man Mero (Gujarati); Hindi and Urdu biographical sketches in Shama & Sushma Magazines respectively, titled \"Naushad Ki Kahani, Naushad Ki Zubani\"; the last one was translated into Marathi by Shashikant Kinikar. Kinikar also came up with a book titled \"Notes of Naushad\" which puts together some interesting anecdotes of Naushad's life. Naushad also composed background music for the TV serial \"Akbar The Great\" telecast in 1988 which was directed by Akbar Khan, brother of Hindi film stars Sanjay Khan and Feroze Khan as also \"The Sword of Tipu Sultan\" produced and directed by Sanjay Khan and Akbar Khan which was telecast in 1990 and became very popular. Naushad died on 5 May 2006 in Mumbai. He was buried at the Juhu Muslim cemetery. He is survived by six daughters Zubeda, Fehmida, Farida, Sayeeda, Rashida, and Waheeda and three sons Rehman Naushad, Raju Naushad & Iqbal Naushad. Rehman Naushad and Raju Naushad had assisted him in some of his films. Also, Naushad composed music for two movies directed by Rahman Naushad, My Friend (1974) and 'Teri Payal Mere Geet (1989). Naushad had requested the Maharashtra State Government to sanction a plot for an institution for promoting Hindustani music. This was sanctioned during his lifetime and the 'Naushad Academy of Hindustani Sangeet' was formed. Naushad was also a respected and published poet and formally launched his book of Urdu poetry entitled Aathwaan Sur (\"The Eighth Note\") and the Navras label's album titled \"Aathwan Sur \u2013 The Other Side of Naushad\" having 8 ghazals as part of Hounslow's book fair and festival \"Bookmela\" in November 1998. The album has lyrics and composition by Naushad, arranged by Uttam Singh. Track list: Naushad was known for his deft adaptation of the classical musical tradition for movies. For some movies like Baiju Bawra, he composed all scores in classical raga modes and arranged for the well-known vocalist Amir Khan to be a music consultant for the film. He could easily work with Western instruments, including the clarinet, the mandolin and the accordion. He could incorporate Western musical idioms in his compositions and compose for Western-style orchestras. During the early 1940s, recordings were done in quiet parks and gardens after midnight because the studios did not have sound-proof recording rooms. In the gardens there would be no echo and disturbances, unlike the studios where the sound reverberated because of the tin roofs. For films like 'Uran Khatola' and 'Amar', he recorded the voice of a particular artiste on a scale of 90, then recorded it on 70, then on 50 and so on. After the complete recording, it was played for the scene and the impact it created was terrific. He was one of the first to introduce sound mixing and the separate recording of voice and music tracks in playback singing. He was the first to combine the flute and the clarinet, the sitar and mandolin. He also introduced the accordion to Hindi film music and was among the first to concentrate on background music to extend characters' moods and dialogue through music. But perhaps his greatest contribution was to bring Indian classical music into the film medium. Many of his compositions were inspired by ragas and he even used distinguished classical artistes like Amir Khan and D.V. Paluskar in Baiju Bawra (1952) and Bade Ghulam Ali Khan in Mughal-e-Azam (1960). Baiju Bawra (1952) demonstrated Naushad's grasp of classical music and his ability to bring it to the masses, for which he won the first Filmfare Best Music Director Award in 1954. For Aan (1952), he was the first to use a 100-piece orchestra. He was the first composer to have developed the system of western notation in India. The notation for the music of the film 'Aan' was published in book form in London. In Uran Khatola (1955), he recorded an entire song without the use of orchestra, having replaced the sound of musical instruments with choral sound of humming. For Mughal-e-Azam (1960) song Ae Mohabbat Zindabad, he used a chorus of 100 persons. He asked Lata Mangeshkar to render a part of the song \"Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya\" in a bathroom that had glazed tiles and then recorded the music to get the echo effect. For Ganga Jamuna (1961), he used lyrics in chaste Bhojpuri dialect. He used just six instruments in the title song of Mere Mehboob (1963). In 2004, a colorized version of the classic Mughal-e-Azam (1960) was released, for which Naushad had the orchestral music specially re-created (in Dolby Digital) by today\u2019s industry musicians, while maintaining all the solo vocals from the original soundtrack. To elaborate, the playback vocals (though not the chorus) recorded four decades ago are mixed with orchestra tracks created in the present millennium. As Indian film music gradually assumed a Western bend starting in the late 1960s, Naushad came to be considered old-fashioned. Composers who could compose rock-and-roll and disco-inflected music started getting increasingly popular. Naushad was still esteemed as a maestro, but his talents were sought mostly for historical movies where traditional scores were appropriate."

        "artist_name": "Noor_Jehan", 
        "biography": " Noor Jehan (Urdu: \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u062c\u06c1\u0627\u06ba\u200e, born Allah Rakhi Wasai; 21 September 1925 \u2013 23 December 2000), better known by her honorific title Malika-e-Tarannum (Urdu: \u0645\u0644\u06a9\u06c1 \u062a\u0631\u0646\u0645\u200e), was a Pakistani singer and actress who worked first in British India and then in Pakistan. Her career spanned more than six decades (1930s\u20131990s). She was renowned as one of the greatest and most influential singers of all time especially throughout South Asia and was given the honorific title of Malika-e-Tarannum (the queen of melody) in Pakistan.She had a great command on Hindustani classical music as well as other genera of music. Born into a family with music traditions, Noor Jehan was pushed by her parents to follow in their musical footsteps and become a singer but she was more interested in acting in films. She recorded over 18,000 songs in various languages of India and Pakistan including Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi and also in Persian. Along with Ahmed Rushdi, she holds the record for having given voice to the largest number of film songs in the history of Pakistani cinema. She is also thought to be one of the most prolific singers of all time, along side her prot\u00e9g\u00e9: renowned Indian playback singer Lata Mangeshkar. She is also considered to be the first female Pakistani film director. Noor Jehan was awarded the Pakistan President's Award by Ayub Khan (general) in 1965 for her acting and singing capabilities, especially for singing patriotic songs passionately during Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.Moreover she also received one of the highest Pakistani civilian awards \"Tamgha-e-Imtiaz\" and \"Sitara-e-Imtiaz\". Noor Jehan received Life Time Achievement Award for twice, once in 1987 and second in 2002 after her death.   Noor Jehan was born into a Punjabi Muslim family in Kasur, Punjab, British India and was one of the eleven children of Madad Ali and Fateh Bibi. Noor Jehan began to sing at the age of five years old and showed a keen interest in a range of styles, including traditional folk and popular theatre. Realising her potential for singing, her mother sent her to receive early training in classical singing under Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. He instructed her in the traditions of the Patiala Gharana of Hindustani classical music and the classical forms of thumri, dhrupad, and khayal. At the age of nine,Noor Jehan drew the attention of Punjabi musician Ghulam Ahmed Chishti, who would later introduce her to stage in Lahore. He composed some ghazals, na`ats and folk songs for her to perform, although she was more keen in breaking into acting or playback singing. Once her vocational training finished, Jehan pursued a career in singing alongside her sister in Lahore and would usually take part in the live song and dance performances prior to screenings of films in cinemas. Theatre owner Diwan Sardari Lal took the small girl to Calcutta in early 1930s and the entire family moved to Calcutta in hopes of developing the movie careers of Allah Wasai and her older sisters, Eiden Bai and Haider Bandi. Mukhtar Begum encouraged the sisters to join film companies and recommended them to various producers. She also recommended them to her husband, Agha Hashar Kashmiri, who owned a maidan theatre (a tented theatre to accommodate large audiences). It was here that Wasai received the stage name Baby Noor Jehan. Her older sisters were offered jobs with one of the Seth Sukh Karnani companies, Indira Movietone and they went on to be known as the Punjab Mail. In 1935, K.D. Mehra directed Punjabi movie Pind di Kuri in which Noor Jehan acted along with her sisters and sang the Punjabi song Langh aja patan chanaaN da O yaar which became her earliest hit. She next acted in a film called Missar Ka Sitara (1936) by the same company and sang in it for music composer, Damodar Sharma. Jehan also played the child role of Heer in the film Heer-Sayyal (1937). One of her popular songs from that period Shala jawaniyan maney is from Dalsukh Pancholi's Punjabi film Gul Bakawli (1939). All these Punjabi movies were made in Calcutta. After a few years in Calcutta, Jehan returned to Lahore in 1938. In 1939, renowned music director Ghulam Haider composed songs for Jehan which led to her early popularity, and he thus became her early mentor. In 1942, she played the main lead opposite Pran in Khandaan (1942). It was her first role as an adult, and the film was a major success. Khandaan's success saw her shifting to Bombay, with director Syed Shaukat Hussain Rizvi. She shared melodies with Shanta Apte in Duhai (1943). It was in this film that Jehan lent her voice for the second time, to another actress named Husn Bano. She married Rizvi later the same year. In 1947, Rizvi and Jehan decided to move to Pakistan. They left Bombay and settled in Karachi with their family. Three years after settling in Pakistan, Jehan starred in her first film in Pakistan, Chan Wey (1951), opposite Santosh Kumar, which was also her first Punjabi film as a heroine and playback singer. Shaukat Hussain Rizvi and Noor Jehan directed this film together making Jehan Pakistan's first female director. Jehan's second film in Pakistan was Dopatta (1952) which was Produced by Aslam Lodhi, Directed by Sibtain Fazli and assisted by A. H. Rana as Production Manager. Dopatta turned out to be an even bigger success than Chan Wey (1951). During 1953 and 1954, Jehan and Rizvi had problems and got divorced due to personal differences. She kept custody of the three children from their marriage. In 1959, she married another film actor, Ejaz Durrani, nine years her junior. Durrani pressured her to give up acting, and her last film as an actress/singer was Mirza Ghalib (1961). This contributed to the strengthening of her iconic stature. She gained another audience for herself. Her rendition of Faiz Ahmed Faiz's Mujh se pehli si mohabbat mere mehboob na maang is a unique example of tarranum, reciting poetry as a song with superb music of Rasheed Attre in Pakistani film Qaidi (1962). Jehan last acted in Baaji in 1963, though not in a leading role. Jehan bade farewell to film acting in 1963 after a career of 33 years (1930\u20131963). The pressure of being a mother of six children and the demands of being a wife to another fellow- film- actor, forced her to give up her career. Jehan made 14 films in Pakistan, ten in Urdu, four in Punjabi as a film actress. After quitting acting she took up playback singing. She made her debut exclusively as a playback singer in 1960 with the film Salma. Her first initial playback singing for a Pakistani film was for 1951 film Chann Wey, for which she was the film director herself. She received many awards, including the Pride of Performance in 1965 by the Pakistani Government. She sang a large number of duets with Ahmed Rushdi, Mehdi Hassan, Masood Rana, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Mujeeb Aalam. She had a great understanding and friendship with many great singers of Asia, for example with Alam Lohar and many more singers also. Jehan made great efforts to attend 'Mehfils' (live concerts) of Ustad Salamat Ali Khan, Ustad Fateh Ali Khan, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Roshan Ara Begum. Lata Mangeshkar commented on Jehan's vocal range that Jehan could sing as low and as high as she wanted and that the quality of her voice always remained the same. Singing was,for Jehan, not effortless but an emotionally and physically draining exercise. In the 1990s, Jehan also sang for then d\u00e9butante actresses Neeli and Reema. For this very reason, Sabiha Khanum affectionately called her Sadabahar (evergreen). Her popularity was further boosted with her patriotic songs during the 1965 war between Pakistan and India. In 1971 Madam Noor Jehan visited Tokyo for World Song Festival as a representative from Pakistan. Jehan visited India in 1982 to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of the Indian talkie movies, where she met Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in New Delhi and was received by Dilip Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar in Bombay. She met all her erstwhile heroes and costars, including Surendra, Pran, Suraiya, composer Naushad and others. The website Women on Record stated, \"Noor Jehan injected a degree of passion into her singing unmatched by anyone else. But she left for Pakistan\".She received more than 13 Nigar Awards for Best Female Playback Singer. Ustad Salamat Ali Khan said that\"Allah Nay Un Ko Pur Asar Awaaz Di Hai Jiss Ki Waja Say Sur Ka Jadoo Jagta Hai Or Ganay Ka Asar Qaim Rehta Hai\" Madam Noor Jehan evovled the playback singing as Ustad Mehdi Hassan Khan done to Ghazal and Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali done to Qawwali. Noor Jehan married Shaukat Hussain Rizvi in 1942, the marriage ended in 1953 with divorce; the couple had three children, including their singer daughter Zil-e-Huma. She married Ejaz Durrani in 1959.

        "biography": " Omkar Prasad Nayyar (16 January 1926 \u2013 28 January 2007) was an Indian film music composer, singer-songwriter, music producer, and musician. He won the 1958 Filmfare Award for Best Music Director (for Naya Daur). Nayyar worked extensively with singers Geeta Dutt, Asha Bhosle and Mohammed Rafi but not with leading Bollywood female singer Lata Mangeshkar. However, Mangeshkar's song Ek To Balam Teri Yaad Satayein (from the 1958 film Aji Bas Shukriya) was used in the 1973 Hindi film Taxi Driver, for which Nayyar was music director. According to music and film expert Rajesh Subramanian, \"Aap Ke Haseen Rukh\" (from Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi) was planned with full orchestration but many of the musicians were late for the recording. After a disagreement with Mohammed Rafi, Nayyar began working with singer Mahendra Kapoor. Kapoor performed Nayyar's songs \"Badal Jaaye Agar Maali\" and \"Chaman Hotaa Nahi Khaali\" in Bahaaren Phir Bhi Aayengi. Based on a Bengali language work by Rabindranath Tagore, Nayyar composed \"Chal Akelaa, Chal Akelaa\" (sung by Mukesh in 1969 film Sambandh). Nayyar co-produced songs with Shamshad Begum (including \"Kajra Mohabbatwala\"), and after Madhubala's 1969 death Vyjayanthimala, Mala Sinha, Padmini, Asha Parekh and Sharmila Tagore lip-synced several Nayyar-Bhosle songs. Nayyar and Bhosle parted ways in 1974, and he then worked with Dilraj Kaur, Alka Yagnik, Krishna Kale, Vani Jayaram and Kavita Krishanmurthy. Majrooh Sultanpuri and Sahir Ludhianvi wrote the lyrics for some of Nayyar's earlier songs, including \"Naya Daur\". Nayyar also worked with developing lyricists such as Jan Nisar Akhtar, Qamar Jalalabadi, S. H. Bihari and Ahmed Wasi. He began the tradition of assigning full, three-minute songs to comedians. Om Prakash sang Nayyar's \"Churi Bane Kanta Bane\" in Jaali Note, and Johnny Walker sang \"Aye Dil Hai Mushkil Jeena Yahaan\" in CID, \"Jaane Kahan Mera Jigar Gaya Jee\" in Mr. & Mrs. 55, \"Main Bambaika Baaboo, Naam Meraa Anjaanaa\" in Naya Daur and \"Bajewala\" in Basant. In addition to songs for Asha Bhosle and Geeta Dutt's, Thandi Thandi Hawaa, Nayyar wrote \"Yeh Desh Hai Veer Jawaanonkaa\" (featuring Dilip Kumar and Ajit) for Naya Daur (1957). The song earned him the 1958 Filmfare Best Music Director Award. The last Nayyar song performed by Bhosle was \"Chain Se Humko Kabhi\". Intended for Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye (1973), disappeared in the film's final cut but won Bhosle the 1975 Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer. Nayyar was more active during the 1960s than he was in the following decade, and did not compose music for younger actors such as Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan. His films included Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Guru Dutt, Dharmendra, Shammi Kapoor, Joy Mukherjee, Biswajit, Feroz Khan, Bharat Bhushan, Asha Parekh, Mumtaz, Sharmila Tagore, Madhubala, Rajshree, Rekha, Ameeta and Shyama. In addition to Hindi films, Nayyar composed for Neerajanam in Telugu. He made a brief comeback during the 1990s with Mangni and Nishchay in 1992 and Zid in 1994.   Nayyar was born in Lahore, British India (present Pakistan). He then underwent music training. He composed the background score for Kaneez (1949), and 1952's Aasmaan (produced by Dalsukh M. Pancholi), was his first film as music director. Nayyar then composed music for Chham Chhama Chham (1952) and Baaz (1953). Film producer, director and actor Guru Dutt enlisted him to compose and conduct music for Aar Paar (1954), Mr. & Mrs. '55 (1955) and C.I.D. (1956). Nayyar's early work was primarily performed by Shamshad Begum, Geeta Dutt and Mohammed Rafi, with Asha Bhosle introduced in C.I.D. In 1957 Filmalaya introduced Nasir Hussain, who wanted a composer to provide romantic scores for newcomers Shammi Kapoor and Ameeta. Nayyar's scores were featured in the Hussain films Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957) and Phir Wohi Dil Laya Hoon (1964). During the decade, state-controlled All India Radio banned most of Nayyar's songs because the broadcaster considered them too \"trendy\". In retirement Nayyar stayed in touch with only a few people, including Gajendra Singh and Ahmed Wasi; Singh included him as a judge for his television show, Sa Re Ga Ma Pa. Wasi interviewed Nayyar twice on Vividh Bharati and presented a series of six one-hour episodes, Mujhe Yaad Sab Hai Zaraa Zaraa, about his life. He had two brothers: P. P. (a physician) and G. P. (a dentist in Secunderabad). Nayyar's wife, Saroj Mohini Nayyar, wrote the lyrics to \"Preetam Aan Milo\" (sung by Geeta Dutt in Mr. & Mrs. '55. Estranged from his family, he requested that they be barred from his funeral. Nayyar had moved out of his Mumbai home, staying with a friend in Virar and then with a friend in Thane. He died on 28 January 2007, survived by his wife, three daughters and a son. Nayyar's death was followed by tributes from many Bollywood figures, including Lata Mangeshkar, Sharmila Tagore, Mumtaz, Mahesh Bhatt, Khayyam, Shakti Samanta, Sonu Nigam, Ravindra Jain, Anu Malik, B R Chopra and Shammi Kapoor. A commemorative stamp was issued by India Post on 3 May 2013. Her granddaughter Niharica Raizada is also an actress."

Tagore's song, Nemecche Aaj Prothom Badal became his first commercial recording, with the Kolkata-based Videophone Company in 1926, at the age of eighteen. This was the first of many albums which made him a household name in Rabindra sangeet.

        "artist_name": "R._D._Burman", 
        "biography": " Rahul Dev Burman (Bengali pronunciation:\u00a0[Rahul Deb B\u00f4rmon]; 27 June 1939\u00a0\u2013 4 January 1994) was an Indian film score composer, who is considered one of the seminal music directors of the Indian film industry. Nicknamed Pancham, he was the only son of the composer Sachin Dev Burman. From the 1960s to the 1990s, Burman composed musical scores for 331 films. He was mainly active in the Hindi film industry as a composer, and also provided vocals for a few of compositions. Burman did major work with Asha Bhosle (his wife) and Kishore Kumar, and scored many of the songs that made these singers famous. He also scored many songs sung by Lata Mangeshkar. He served as an influence to the next generation of Indian music directors, and his songs continue to be popular in India.   Burman was born to the Bollywood composer/singer Sachin Dev Burman and his lyricist wife Meera Dev Burman (n\u00e9e Dasgupta), in Calcutta. Initially, he was nicknamed Tublu by his maternal grandmother although he later became known by the nickname of Pancham. According to some stories, he was nicknamed as Pancham because, as a child, whenever he cried, it sounded in the fifth note (Pa), G scale, of music notation. The word Pancham means five (or fifth) in Bengali, his mother tongue. Another theory says that the baby was nicknamed Pancham because he could cry in five different notes. Yet another version is that when the veteran Indian actor Ashok Kumar saw a newborn Rahul uttering the syllable Pa repeatedly, he nicknamed the boy Pancham. Burman received his early education in West Bengal. His father S. D. Burman was a noted music director in Bollywood, the Mumbai-based Hindi film industry. When he was nine years old, R. D. Burman composed his first song, Aye meri topi palat ke aa, which his father used in the film Funtoosh (1956). The tune of the song Sar jo tera chakraaye was also composed by him as a child; his father included it in the soundtrack of Guru Dutt's Pyaasa (1957). In Mumbai, Burman was trained by Ustad Ali Akbar Khan (sarod) and Samta Prasad (tabla). He also considered Salil Chowdhury as his guru. He served as an assistant to his father, and often played harmonica in his orchestras. Some of the notable films in which Burman is credited as the music assistant include Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958), Kaagaz Ke Phool (1959), Tere Ghar Ke Samne (1963), Bandini (1963), Ziddi (1964), Guide (1965) and Teen Devian (1965). Burman also played mouth organ for his father's hit composition Hai Apna Dil To Aawara which was featured in the film Solva Saal . This song was sung by the legendary artist Hemanta Mukhopadhyay, who was also a legendary exponent of Rabindra Sangeet.(1958). In 1959, Burman signed up as a music director for the film Raaz, directed by Guru Dutt's assistant Niranjan. However, the film was never completed. The lyrics of this Guru Dutt and Waheeda Rehman-starrer film were written by Shailendra. Burman recorded two songs for the film, before it was shelved. The first song was sung by Geeta Dutt and Asha Bhosle, and the second one had vocals by Shamshad Begum. Burman's first released film as an independent music director was Chhote Nawab (1961). When the noted Bollywood comedian Mehmood decided to produce Chhote Nawab, he first approached Burman's father Sachin Dev Burman for the music. However, S. D. Burman declined the offer, advising he was unavailable. At this meeting, Mehmood noticed Rahul playing tabla, and signed him as the music director for Chhote Nawab. Burman later developed a close association with Mehmood, and made a cameo in Mehmood's Bhoot Bangla (1965). Burman's first hit film as a film music director was Teesri Manzil (1966). Burman gave credit to lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri for recommending him to Nasir Hussain, the producer and writer of the film. Vijay Anand also said that he had arranged a music session for Burman before Nasir Hussain. Teesri Manzil had six songs, all of which were written by Majrooh Sultanpuri, and sung by Mohammed Rafi. Four of these were duets with Asha Bhosle, whom Burman later married. Nasir Hussain went on to sign Burman and lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri for six of his films including Baharon Ke Sapne (1967), Pyar Ka Mausam (1969) and Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973). Burman's score for Padosan (1968) was well received. Meanwhile, he continued to work as his father's assistant for films including Jewel Thief (1967) and Prem Pujari (1970). The hit Kishore Kumar song Mere Sapnon ki Raani from Aradhana (1969), though credited to his father, is rumoured to have been Burman's composition. Kora Kagaz tha Yeh Man Mera from the same film was also his tune. It is believed that when S. D. Burman fell ill during the recording of the film's music, Burman took over and completed the music. He was credited as an associate composer for the film.[citation needed] Burman's first wife was Rita Patel, whom he had met in Darjeeling. Rita, a fan, had bet her friends that she would be able to get a film-date with Burman. The two married in 1966, and divorced in 1971. The song Musafir Hoon Yaaron (\"I'm a Traveller\") from Parichay (1972) was composed by him, when he was at a hotel after the separation. Burman married Asha Bhosle in 1980. Together, they recorded many hit songs and also staged many live performances. Although, towards the end of his life, they did not live together. Burman had financial difficulties, particularly later in his life. His mother Meera died in 2007, thirteen years after his death. She had been suffering from Alzheimer's even before her son's death. Just before her death she had been moved to an old age home, and moved back to her son's residence after the issue became a controversy. In the 1970s, Burman became highly popular with the Kishore Kumar songs in Rajesh Khanna-starrer films. Kati Patang (1970), a musical hit, was the beginning of a series of the 1970s films directed by Shakti Samanta of Aradhana fame. Its songs Yeh Shaam Mastani and Yeh Jo Mohabbat Hai, sung by Kishore Kumar, became instant hits. Apart from Kishore Kumar, Burman also composed several of the popular songs sung by Mohammed Rafi, Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar. In 1970, Burman composed the music for Dev Anand's Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971). The Asha Bhosle song Dum Maro Dum from this film proved to be a seminal rock number in the Hindi film music. The filmmaker Dev Anand did not include the complete version of Dum Maro Dum in the film, because he was worried that the song would overshadow the film. In the same year, Burman composed the music for Amar Prem. The Lata Mangeshkar song Raina Beeti Jaaye from this soundtrack is regarded as a classical music gem in Hindi film music. Burman's other hits in 1971 included the romantic song \"Raat kali ek khwab mein\" from Buddha Mil Gaya and the Helen-starrer cabaret song \"Piya Tu Ab To Aaja\" from Caravan. He received his first Filmfare Award nomination for Caravan. In 1972, Burman composed hit music for several films including Seeta aur Geeta, Rampur ka Lakshman, Mere jeevan saathi, Bombay to Goa, Apna Desh and Parichay. His success continued with hits such as Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973), Aap ki Kasam (1974), Sholay (1975) and Aandhi (1975). He also composed a song for a small documentary film called Maa Ki Pukaar, in 1975. After his father S. D. Burman went into coma, Burman also completed the music of Mili (1975). Mohammed Rafi received the National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the song Kya Hua Tera Wada from Hum Kisise Kum Naheen (1977), composed by Burman. He continued to compose several popular songs for films such as Kasme Vaade (1978), Ghar (1978), Gol Maal (1979), Khubsoorat (1980). He received his first Filmfare Best Music Director Award for Sanam Teri Kasam (1981). In 1981, he also composed hit music for Rocky, Satte Pe Satta and Love Story. The playback singer Kumar Sanu was given his first break by Burman in Yeh Desh (1984) as voice of Kamal Haasan. Abhijeet was given his major break by Burman in Anand Aur Anand (1984). Although he made his debut a long time ago, Hariharan was first noticed in a duet with Kavita Krishnamurthy in Hai Mubarak Aaj ka Din from Boxer (1984), which was composed by Burman. In 1985, Mohammed Aziz, made his debut with Shiva Ka Insaaf (1985) under Burman. The trio Rajesh Khanna-Kishore-R.D.Burman have worked together in 32 films together, and these films and songs continue to be popular. The trio were close friends. R.D.Burman composed for 40 films for Rajesh Khanna. During the late 1980s, he was overshadowed by Bappi Lahiri and other disco music composers. Many filmmakers stopped patronizing him, as films featuring his compositions flopped at the box office one after the other. Nasir Hussain, who had signed him up for every single of his productions since Teesri Manzil (1966), did not sign him up for Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988). Hussain defended Burman in the press, saying that the latter did not give weak music in Zamane Ko Dikhana Hai (1982) and Manzil Manzil (1984). He also said that the composer was going through a lean phase during the recording of Zabardast (1985). But after these three films flopped, Hussain stepped down as a director, and his son and successor Mansoor Khan switched to other composers. The filmmaker Subhash Ghai promised Burman Ram Lakhan (1989), but gave it instead to Laxmikant-Pyarelal, who had earlier played in Burman's orchestra. In 1986, Burman composed songs for Ijaazat; the score is regarded as one of his best. However, the film belonged to the Parallel Cinema genre of (art films), so it did not stop the decline of Burman's commercial film career. All four of the songs in Ijaazat were sung by Asha Bhosle and written by Gulzar. Burman was greatly appreciated by the critics for setting the non-rhyming lyrics of the song Mera Kuchh Saamaan to the music. While both Asha Bhosle (Best Female Playback) and Gulzar (Best Lyrics) received National Awards for the score, Burman received none. Burman suffered from a heart attack in 1988, and underwent heart bypass surgery a year later at The Princess Grace Hospital in London. During this period, he composed many tunes, which were never released. He composed music for Vidhu Vinod Chopra's film Parinda in 1989. He composed one song called Chhod Ke Na Jaana which was sung by Asha Bhosle for the film Gang. But since the film took too long to release and due to his untimely death, director Mazhar Khan signed in the then little known Anu Malik for the music of the film. Thenmavin Kombath, a Malayalam film by Priyadarshan was the last film he signed, but he died before he could score for the film. The music of 1942: A Love Story (1994) was released after his death, and was highly successful. It posthumously won him the third and last of his Filmfare Awards. As per Lata Mangeshkar, he died too young and unhappy. Burman has been credited with revolutionizing the Bollywood music. He incorporated a wide range of influences from several genres in his scores. Burman's career coincided with the rise of Rajesh Khanna-starrer youth love stories. He made electronic rock popular in these popular love stories. He often mixed disco and rock elements with Bengali folk music. He also used jazz elements, which had been introduced to him by the studio pianist Kersi Lord. According to Douglas Wolk, Burman \"wrapped sugary string swoops around as many ideas as he could squeeze in at once\". Biswarup Sen describes his popular music as one featuring multicultural influences, and characterized by \"frenetic pacing, youthful exuberance and upbeat rhythms\". Burman was influenced by Western, Latin, Oriental and Arabic music, and incorporated elements from these in his own music. He also experimented with different musical sounds produced from methods such as rubbing sand paper and knocking bamboo sticks together. He blew into beer bottles to produce the opening beats of Mehbooba, Mehbooba. Similarly, he used cups and saucers to create the tinkling sound for the song Churaliya Hai from the film Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973). For Satte Pe Satta (1982), he made the singer Annette Pinto gargle to produce a background sound. He also used a rubbed a comb on a rough surface to produce a whooshing sound in the song Meri Samne Wali Khidki Main from the film Padosan (1968) On multiple occasions, Burman experimented with recording the same song with different singers. For Kudrat (1981), he recorded the light version of the song Hume tumse pyar kitna in the voice of Kishore Kumar, while the classical version was recorded in the voice of Parveen Sultana. In Pyar Ka Mausam (1969), he recorded the song Tum bin jaun kahan in the voices of Kishore Kumar and Mohammed Rafi separately. Burman sometimes used the Western dance music as a source of inspiration for his compositions. As was common in Bollywood, some of his songs featured the tunes of popular foreign songs. Often, the filmmakers forced him to copy these tunes for the soundtracks, resulting in allegations of plagiarism. For example, Ramesh Sippy insisted that the tune of the traditional Cyprus song Say You Love Me (arranged and sung by Demis Roussos) be used for Mehbooba Mehbooba (Sholay, 1975), and Nasir Hussain wanted to use ABBA's Mamma Mia for Mil gaya hum ko sathi. Other examples of Burman songs inspired by foreign songs including Aao twist karein from Bhoot Bangla (Chubby Checker's \"Let's Twist\"), Tumse milke (Leo Sayer's When I Need You), and Zindagi milke bitaayenge (Paul Anka's The Longest Day) and Jahan teri yeh nazar hai (Persian artist Zia Atabi's Heleh maali) and Dilbar mere (Alexandra's Zigeunerjunge). Burman often collaborated with same film directors and worked with the same musicians. Music Assistants String Instruments Percussion Instruments Keyboard Instruments Wind Instruments Several Hindi films made after Burman's death contain his original songs or their remixed versions. Dil Vil Pyar Vyar (2002), which contains several re-arranged hit songs of Burman, was made as a tribute to him. Jhankaar Beats (2003), which catapulted the music director duo Vishal-Shekhar into the limelight, is also a tribute to him. In Khwahish (2003), Mallika Sherawat's character is a Burman fan; the film features repeated references to him. In 2010, Brahmanand Singh released a 113-minute documentary titled Pancham Unmixed: Mujhe Chalte Jaana Hai, which received critical acclaim. The music of Lootera (2013) is a tribute to Burman. Other films which credit R. D. Burman include Gang (2000) and Monsoon Wedding (2001, for Chura liya hai). A number of Indian remix albums feature Burman's songs, which are also popular in the country's pubs and discos. Several of his compositions were re-mixed by the South Asian DJs in the United Kingdom and North America, and feature in popular albums such as Bally Sagoo's Bollywood Flashback. Kronos Quartet's You've Stolen My Heart (2005) contains Burman's compositions sung by his wife Asha Bhosle. In the 2012 film Khiladi 786, Music Director, Composer, Singer and Actor Himesh Reshammiya-composed song Balma is also a tribute to R.D. Burman. In 1995, Filmfare Awards constituted the Filmfare RD Burman Award for New Music Talent in his memory. The award is given to upcoming music talent in Hindi cinema. In 2009, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation named a public square in Santa Cruz after Burman. Burman inspired many later Bollywood music composers, such as Vishal-Shekhar. Jatin-Lalit are considered to have carried on Burman's legacy through the 1990s. Notable musical assistants to Burman include Manohari Singh and Sapan Chakraborty. His instrumentalists included Hari Prasad Chaurasia, Shiv Kumar Sharma, Louis Banks, Bhupinder and Kersy Lord. He is also noted for his partnership with the lyricist Gulzar, who wrote the words for several of his finest compositions. Pancham Unmixed, a winner of 2 National Awards, is a 113-minute biopic on Burman, directed by Brahmanand Singh. A postage stamp, bearing Burman's face, was released by India Post to honour him on 3 May 2013. On the anniversary of his 77th birthday on 27 June 2016 Google had a Doodle of R.D Burman on its Indian Home Page. Out of Burman's 331 released film scores, 292 were in Hindi, 31 in Bengali, 3 in Telugu, 2 each in Tamil and Oriya, and 1 in Marathi. Burman also composed for 5 TV Serials in Hindi and Marathi. Pancham's non-film music comprises few albums, including Pantera (1987), a Latin Rock album produced by Pete Gavankar (father of Janina Gavankar). The album was an international collaboration, for which Burman partnered with Jose Flores in San Francisco. In 1987, Burman, Gulzar and Asha Bhosle worked on an album titled Dil Padosi Hai, which was released on 8 September 1987, Asha Bhosle's birthday. Burman and Asha Bhosle also recorded a song with Boy George. In addition, he scored a large number of non-film songs in Bengali, which are available in different albums, and from which many numbers were later adapted in Hindi films. Burman also did playback singing in eighteen films for which he himself composed the scores. Though Burman laid the foundation for numerous Bollywood music directors to pave the path for the future of music in Bollywood cinema, he was awarded a total of only three Filmfare Awards, one of which was awarded posthumously (for 1942: A Love Story)."

        "artist_name": "Sahir_Ludhianvi", 
        "biography": " Sahir Ludhianvi is the pen name of Abdul Hayee (8 March 1921 \u2013 25 October 1980) who is popularly known as Sahir. Sahir was an Indian poet and film lyricist who wrote in the Hindi and Urdu languages. His work influenced Indian cinema, in particular Bollywood film. Sahir won a Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist for Taj Mahal (1963). He won a second Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist for his work on Kabhie Kabhie (1976) and he was awarded the Padma Shri in 1971. On 8 March 2013, the ninety-second anniversary of Sahir's birth, a commemorative stamp was issued in his honour.   On 8 March 1921, in a red sandstone haveli in Karimpura, Ludhiana, Punjab, India, Sahir was born to a Muslim family. His mother, Sardar Begum, left her estranged husband thus forfeiting any claim to financial assets from the marriage. In 1934, Sahir's father remarried and sued (acrimoniously and unsuccessfully) for custody of his son. Sardar Begum required protection from Sahir's father and suffered financial deprivation. Sahir's place of birth is marked with a small plaque on the building's arched entrance. Sahir was educated at the Khalsa High School in Ludhiana. He then enrolled at the Satish Chander Dhawan Government College For Boys, Ludhiana. The auditorium there is named after him. As a college student, Sahir was popular for his ghazals and nazms (poetry in Urdu) and empassioned speeches. In his first year, however, he was expelled for fraternising with a female student on the principal's lawn. In 1943, Sahir settled in Lahore. There, he completed Talkhiyaan (Bitterness) (1945), his first published work in Urdu. Sahir edited Urdu magazines such as Adab-e-Lateef, Shahkaar, Prithlari, and Savera  and became a member of the Progressive Writers' Association. However, when he made controversial statements promoting communism, a warrant for his arrest was issued by the Government of Pakistan. In 1949, after partition, Sahir fled from Lahore to Delhi. He moved to India as he missed his Hindu and Sikh friends who had fled from Pakistan and he preferred to live in secular India over an Islamic Pakistan. After eight weeks, Sahir moved to Bombay. He later lived in Andheri, a suburb of Mumbai. There, his neighbours included Gulzar, a poet and lyricist and Krishan Chander, an Urdu litterateur. In the 1970s, Sahir built a bungalow which he called Parchaiyaan (Shadows), after one of his works, and lived there till his death. Sahir's partners were Amrita Pritam, a poet, novelist and essayist and later Sudha Malhotra, a singer and actress. Although there were also other women in his life, he did not marry. On 25 October 1980, at the age of fifty-nine, Sahir died a sudden cardiac death (he had been a smoker and drinker). He died in the presence of his friend, Javed Akhtar. Sahir was buried at the Juhu Muslim cemetery. In 2010, his tomb was demolished to make room for new interments. Sahir's work as a lyricist in the film industry gave him financial stability beyond his earnings as a poet. He made his debut with four songs performed in the film Azadi Ki Raah Par (1949). One of the songs was Badal Rahi Hai Zindagi. Both the film and its songs went unnoticed. However, after Naujawaan (1951), with music by S.D. Burman, Sahir gained recognition. Sahir's major success was Baazi (1951). Again, the composer was Burman. Sahir was then considered part of Guru Dutt's team. The last film Sahir made with Burman was Pyaasa. In Pyaasa, Guru Dutt played a poet named Vijay. After Pyaasa, Sahir and Burman went separate ways due to artistic and contractual differences. Sahir did work with other composers including Ravi, Roshan, Khayyam and Datta Naik. Naik, a Goan, admired Sahir's poetry and their collaboration produced the score for Milaap (1955). Sahir also worked with music director Laxmikant-Pyarelal in the films like \"Man Ki Aankhe\", \"Izzat\", \"Dustan\" and Yash Chopra's \"Daag\" all have fabulous songs. From about 1950 until his death, Sahir collaborated with Baldev Raj Chopra (1914 - 2008), a film producer and director. Sahir's last work for Chopra was for Insaaf Ka Tarazu. Yash Chopra, an independent director and producer, also engaged Sahir. In 1958, Sahir wrote the lyrics for Ramesh Saigal's film Phir Subah Hogi, which was based on Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment. The male lead was played by Raj Kapoor. It was presumed that Shankar-Jaikishan would be the composer but Sahir demanded a composer with a more intimate knowledge of the novel. Khayyam composed the film score. The song Woh Subah Kabhi Toh Aayegi with its minimal background music remains popular. Khayyam collaborated with Sahir in many films including Kabhie Kabhie and Trishul. Sahir was a controversial figure in that he was artistically temperamental. He insisted that the film score should be composed for his lyrics and not the other way around. He also insisted on being paid one rupee more than Lata Mangeshkar and this created a rift between them. Sahir promoted his girlfriend, Sudha Malhotra's singing career. He also insisted that All India Radio credit lyricists. Sahir wrote, Sahir was different from his contemporaries in that he did not praise Khuda (God), Husn (beauty) or Jaam (wine). Instead, he wrote bitter yet sensitive lyrics about the declining values of society; the senselessness of war and politics; and the domination of consumerism over love. His love songs, tinged with sorrow, expressed his realisation that there were other, starker concepts more important than love. Sahir might be called the \"bard for the underdog\". Close to his heart were the farmer crushed by debt, the soldier gone to fight someone else's war, the woman forced to sell her body, the youth frustrated by unemployment and the family living on the street for instance. Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India said he was moved by Sahir's lyrics in Pyaasa.[citation needed] Vijay, as he is passing through a red light area sings, Sahir's poetry has a Faizian quality. Like Faiz, Sahir gave Urdu poetry an intellectual element that caught the imagination of the youth of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and reflected the feelings of the people of the age. He roused people from an independence-induced smugness. He would pick on the self-appointed custodian of religion, the self-serving politician, the exploitative capitalist, and the war-mongering super-powers. Sahir wrote with verve about the arrest of progressive writers in Pakistan; the launch of the satellite Sputnik and the discovery of Ghalib by a government lusting after minority votes. He wrote Kahat-e-Bangal (The Famine of Bengal) at 25 years of age. Subah-e-Navroz (Dawn of a New Day), mocks the way people celebrate while the poor exist in squalor. Of the Taj mahal, he wrote, The poet asks his lover to meet him anywhere else but at the Taj Mahal: although the tomb has been a symbol of luxurious monarchy for years, there is no need for beautiful (but not famous) hearts to travel to meet there. Of his legacy, Sahir writes,  Sahir's life has been chronicled by Sabir Dutt and by Chander Verma and Dr. Salman Abid in \"Main Sahir Hoon\"  In 2010, Danish Iqbal wrote a stage play entitled, Sahir, about the poet's life. It was successfully directed by Pramila Le Hunt in its Delhi premier. It used song to narrate Sahir's life. Sahir Ludhianvi: the People's Poet by Akshay Manwani The book is the product of interviews and writings about Sahir given by his friends such as Yash Chopra, Dev Anand, Javed Akhtar, Khayyam, Sudha Malhotra, Ravi Chopra and Ravi Sharma. The book also analyses Sahir\u2019s poetry and lyrics in the context of his personal life. Sahir\u2019s contribution to the Progressive Writers\u2019 Movement is also discussed."

        "biography": " Salil Chowdhury (Bengali: \u09b8\u09b2\u09bf\u09b2 \u099a\u09cc\u09a7\u09c1\u09b0\u09c0; 'Sholil Choudhuri' in phonetic Wiki-Bengali; 19 November 1923 \u2013 5 September 1995) was an Indian music composer, who mainly composed for Bengali, Hindi and Malayalam films. He was also a poet and a playwright. He is affectionately called Salilda by his admirers. His musical ability was widely recognised and acknowledged in the Indian film industry. He was an accomplished composer and arranger who was proficient in several musical instruments, including flute, the piano, and the esraj. He was also widely acclaimed and admired for his inspirational and original poetry in Bengali.   Salil Chowdhury was born on 19 November 1925in a village called Harinavi in West Bengal. Salil's childhood was spent in the tea gardens region of Assam. From an early age he listened to the Western Classical collection of his father. His father was reputed to stage plays with coolies and other low-paid workers of the tea-gardens.[citation needed] He studied in Harinavi D.V.A.S High School and there after graduated from Bangabasi College, affiliated to the University of Calcutta in Kolkata, and during this period his political ideas were formulated along with a considerable maturity in his musical ideas.[citation needed] In 1944, a young Salil came to Calcutta for his graduate studies. He joined the IPTA (Indian Peoples Theater Association) the cultural wing of the Communist Party of India. He started writing songs and setting tunes for them. The IPTA theatrical outfit travelled through the villages and the cities bringing these songs to the common man. Songs like Bicharpati, Runner and Abak prithibi became extremely popular with the general population at the time. Songs like Gaayer bodhu, which he composed at the age of 20, brought about a new wave of Bengali music. Almost every notable singer at the time from West Bengal had sung at least one of his songs. A few examples are Debabrata Biswas, Hemanta Mukherjee, Shyamal Mitra, Sandhya Mukherjee, Manabendra Mukherjee, Subir Sen and Pratima Banerjee. His first Bengali film \"Paribortan\" (\"Transformation\") was released in 1949.The singer of his debut song was Debabrata Biswas. \"Mahabharati\" released in 1994 was the last of his 41 Bengali films. Salil da's debut in the Hindi Film Industry came in 1953 as the Music Director for Do Bigha Zamin (based on Tagore's poem/narrative by the same name, but the story was different, story was written by Salil Chowdhury himself) Directed by Bimal Roy It also took his career to new heights when it became the first film to win the Filmfare Best Movie Award and won the international Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. After about 20 years in Bengali and Hindi films, Salil da entered Malayalam films in 1964 with Chemmeen. He went on to compose for over 75 Hindi films, over 40 Bengali films, around 27 Malayalam films, and a few Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Gujarati, Oriya and Assamese films. The name of the assamese films are APARAJEYO (Dir\u00a0: CHATURANGA - Phani Talukdar, Munin Bayan, Atul Bardaloi and Gauri Barman 1970) and MANASH KANYA (Dir- Phani Talukdar) 1985. Salil Chowdhury was married to Jyoti Chowdhury (who lives at Bandra in Mumbai, with whom he had two daughters) and later he married Sabita Chowdhury also, with whom he has two daughters Antara, Sanchari and two son Sanjoy Chowdhury and Bobby Chowdhury. Sanjoy Chowdhury is a successful music composer himself and scored music for over a 100 feature films. Sabita Chaowdhury was a singer and their daughter, Antara is currently a performing artist.[citation needed] She recently sang[when?] for Music Director Shantanu Moitra's hit movie Khoya Khoya Chand in a duet with Sonu Nigam.[citation needed] Hindi and Bengali singles from the album have been released on the iTunes Music Store worldwide. These include in Hindi, \"kyon beheke hain / stranger\" and \"chale ayona / so far away\" with lyrics by Yogesh and music by Sanjoy Chowdhury and in Bengali, \"esho boshona / sit beside me\" and \"dur ojanate / far away\" with lyrics by Salil Chowdhury and Tarun respectively and music by Sanjoy Chowdhury. Salil's music was a blending of Eastern and the Western music traditions. He had once said: \"I want to create a style which shall transcend borders \u2013 a genre which is emphatic and polished, but never predictable\".[this quote needs a citation] He dabbled in a lot of things and it was his ambition to achieve greatness in everything he did.[citation needed] But at times, his confusion was fairly evident: \"I do not know what to opt for: poetry, story writing, orchestration or composing for films. I just try to be creative with what fits the moment and my temperament\", he once told a journalist.[this quote needs a citation] Salil's love for Western classical music started when he was a young boy growing up in an Assam tea garden where his father worked as a doctor. His father inherited a large number of western classical records and a gramophone from a departing Irish doctor. While Salil listened to Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Chopin, and others everyday, his daily life was surrounded by the sound of the forest, chirping of the birds, sound of the flute and the local folk-music of Assam.[citation needed] This left a lasting impression in young Salil. He became an self-taught flute player and his favourite composer was Mozart. His compositions often used folk melodies or melodies based on Indian classical ragas but the orchestration was very much western in its construction. He developed a style which was immediately identifiable.[citation needed]According to his daughter Antara, (Ref.: Ek Fankar @ Vividbharati Radio Programme at 10.00\u00a0pm on 19 November 2013), Salil himself joked that he was Mozart, reborn. Salil being a composing exponent, he even sensed the talent of a guitarist who played in his orchestra and uttered that, \"I think he\u2019s going to be the best composer in India\". The guitarist eventually turned out to be Maestro Ilaiyaraaja."

C. Dey from 1925 to 1930; thereafter in 1932 he came under the tutelage of Bhismadev Chattopadhaya, who was only three years his senior. This was followed by training from Kahifa Badal Khan, Sarangi player, and Ustad Allauddin Khan. He got K.C. Dey, Ustad Badal Khan and Allauddin Khan into Agartala. Noted Bengal poet laureate, Kazi Nazrul Islam also spent time in their family home in Comilla in the early '20s.[citation needed] SD Burman started working as a radio singer on Calcutta Radio Station in the late '20s, when his work as a singer composer was based on Bengali folk and light Hindustani classical music. Consequently, his compositions were mainly influenced by his huge repertoire of folk-tunes from present Bangladesh and later other parts of India and around the world. His first record was also released in 1932 (Hindustan Musical Product), with \"Khamaj\" semi classical, E Pathey Aaj Eso Priyo on one side and the folk 'Dakle Kokil Roj Bihane' on the reverse side on 78 rpm for Hindustan Records. In the following decade he reached his peak as a singer, cutting as many as 131 songs in Bengali, and also sang for composers like Himangsu Dutta (8), RC Boral (1), Nazrul Islam (4) and Sailesh Das Gupta (2) and Subal Das Gupta (1). He also sang for Madhavlal Master (1) and son RD Burman (1). In 1934, he attended the All India Music Conference, at the invitation of Allahabad University, where he presented his Bengali Thumri, all to an illustrious audience, with the likes of Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit and the inimitable Abdul Karim Khan of Kirana Gharana. Later in the year, he was invited to Bengal Music Conference, Kolkata, which was inaugurated by Rabindranath Tagore, here again he sang his thumri, and was awarded a Gold Medal. He built a house in Southend Park, Ballygunge, Kolkata. He married his student, Meera Das Gupta (1920\u20132007), the granddaughter of Magistrate Raibahadur Kamalnath Dasgupta from Dhaka on 10 February 1938 in Calcutta, though according to some, having married a non-royal, created a furore within the royal family, and subsequently he severed ties with his family, and forfeited his inheritance. According to some others, S.D.Burman severed ties with his royal family because he was frustrated with the unjust and unfair treatment meted out to his father and his brothers by the royal family of Tripura. The couple's only child, Rahul Dev Burman was born in 1939, and later, both Meera Devi and Rahul assisted, S.D. Burman with some of the musical compositions. S. D. Burman also did a singing role in Urdu film Selima (1934) and another role in Dhiren Ganguli's film, Bidrohi (1935) As a music composer, he started with Bengali plays, Sati Tirtha and Janani, and eventually gave his first score in film, Rajgee in 1937, his second film Rajkumarer Nirbashan (1940) became a hit. He gave music in Bengali films like, Protishodh (1941), Abhoyer Biye (1942), and Chaddobeshi (1944) and only one Bengali film in 1969/70 after he permanently moved to Mumbai in 1946. He composed for over 20 Bengali films and 89 Hindi films in all. He made his film debut singing in Yahudi ki Ladki (1933) but the songs were scrapped and re-sung by Pahari Sanyal. His first film as a singer was finally Sanjher Pidim (1935). In 1944, Burman moved to Mumbai, at the request of Sasadhar Mukherjee of Filmistan, who asked him to give score for two Ashok Kumar starrers, Shikari (1946) and Aath Din, but his first major breakthrough came the following year with the company's Do Bhai (1947). The song Mera Sundar Sapna Beet Gaya sung by Geeta Dutt was his breakthrough song into the film industry. In 1949, came Shabnam, his biggest hit yet with Filmistan, especially noticeable for its multi-lingual hit song Yeh Duniya Roop ki Chor, by Shamshad Begum, which became a rage in those days. Disillusioned with the materialism of Mumbai, Burman left the Ashok Kumar starred Mashaal (1950) incomplete and decided to board the first train back to Calcutta. Fortunately, he was dissuaded from doing so. In 1950s, Burman teamed up with Dev Anand's Nav Ketan Productions to create musical hits like Taxi Driver, Nau do Gyarah (1957) and Kala Paani(1958). In addition, he gave music for Munimji (1955) and Paying Guest (1957). The songs sung by Mohammed Rafi and Kishore Kumar became popular. Burman da composed the music for Dev Anand's production company Navketan's first film Afsar (1950). With the success of their second film, Baazi (1951) he made it to the top and a long association with Navketan and Dev Anand was on its way. \"Baazi\"'s jazzy musical score revealed a new facet of singer Geeta Dutt, who was mainly known for melancholy songs and bhajans. While every song in the film was a hit, one stood out for special appeal \u2013 \"Tadbir se Bigdi Hui Taqdeer\", a ghazal that was occidentalised into a seductive song.The 'jaal' song 'Yeh raat Yeh chandni' by Hemant Kumar is an all-time great classic. He also wrote music for the Guru Dutt classics \u2013 Pyaasa (1957) and Kaagaz Ke Phool (1959). The soundtrack of Devdas (1955) was also composed by him. House No. 44 (1955), Funtoosh (1956), and Solva Saal (1958) were other S. D. Burman hits. In 1959 came Sujata, a masterpiece by Bimal Roy, and S. D. created magic again with \"Jalte hai jiske liye\" by Talat Mamood. When Guru Dutt made comparatively light-weight films like Baazi and Jaal (1952), Burmanda reflected their mood with compositions like Suno Gajar Kya Gaye or De Bhi Chuke Hum and when Guru Dutt made his somber masterpieces \u2013 Pyaasa (1957) and Kaagaz ke Phool (1959), he was right on target with Jinhe Naaz Hai Hind and Waqt ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam. In 2004, the soundtrack for Pyaasa was chosen as one of \"The Best Music in Film\" by Sight & Sound, the British Film Institute magazine. In 1957, S. D. Burman fell out with Lata Mangeshkar and adopted her younger sister Asha Bhosle as his lead female singer. The team of S. D. Burman, Kishore Kumar, Asha Bhosle and lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri became popular for their duet songs. Thus, he was responsible along with O. P. Nayyar for shaping Asha Bhosle as a singer of repute, who became his daughter-in-law after she married Rahul Dev Burman. In 1958, S. D. Burman gave music for Kishore Kumar's house production Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi, the same year he was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for Music direction of 'Sujata' and remains the only music director to have won the prestigious award. S.D. Burman often took inspiration from folk music, Hindustani classical music as well as the more mundane day to day sounds of life. For example: in a later interview, he discussed how he had composed the Kaala Pani tune for the Majrooh Sultanpuri / Md. Rafi / Dev Anand song \"Hum bekhudi mein tum\" based upon the Hindustani Raga \"Raag Chayyanat\" and the Muslim Muezzin's call for prayers that one hears daily near a mosque. Early on in his career, Burman refused to allow his voice be lip-synced on film by actors, as a result, even later on, in Hindi cinema, his thin yet powerful voice was often used as bardic commentary to haunting results, as in Ore Majhi Mere Sajan Hai Us Paar Bandini (1963), Wahaan Kaun hai Tera from \"Guide\" (1965) and finally Safal Hogi Teri Aradhana from Aradhana (1969), for which he received the National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the year, 1970 . Ill health caused a slump in his career in the early 1960s but he gave many hit films in late 1960s. In 1961, S. D. Burman and Lata Mangeshkar came together during the recording of R.D. Burman's first song for the movie Chhote Nawab (1961). They reconciled their differences and started working again in 1962. The Dev Anand-S. D. Burman partnership, under Navketan banner, continued to churn out musical hits like Bombai Ka Baboo (1960), Tere Ghar Ke Samne (1963), Teen Devian (1965), Guide (1965) and Jewel Thief (1967). In 1963, he composed songs for Meri Surat Teri Aankhen and Manna Dey sang the song \"Poocho Na Kaise Maine\" in raga Ahir Bhairav. This song is inspired by a kazi nazrul Islam song \"Arun kanti ke go\" and a Ustad Mushtaq Hussain Khan's Khayal which was based on raga Ahir bhairavbhairavi (morning ragaa). That movie also had a song, 'Nache Mora Manwa Magan',sung by Rafi,which became landmarks in Hindi film songs. Other S D Burman hits from this period were Bandini (1963) and Ziddi (1964). In Bandini, Sampooran Singh (well known as Gulzar), made his debut as a lyricist with the song \"Mora Gora Ang lai le, mohe shaam rang daai de\", although other songs were written by Shailendra. Guide (1965) starring Dev Anand, was probably the best[citation needed] of his work during the time with all the songs super hit as well as the film; but unfortunately it did not receive the Filmfare Award in best music director category for that year, which remained always a discussion among the Bollywood film pandits. Aradhana (1969) is considered another landmark score in the Bollywood history. The music of the movie shaped the careers of singer Kishore Kumar, lyricist Anand Bakshi and filmmaker Shakti Samanta. S.D. Burman wrote the music for all the songs of Aradhana, but fell ill soon after and handed over the task of composing the backgroudn music for the film to his young upcoming talented son R.D.Burman. For the song \"Mere Sapno ki raani\", Sachin Dev made R.D play the mouth organ[citation needed]. Dev Anand and S. D. Burman continued their musical partnership in Prem Pujari (1969). S. D. Burman had a strong sense of self-pride and was very professional in his work. Tere Mere Sapne (1971), Sharmeelee (1971), Abhimaan (1973), Prem Nagar (1974), Sagina (1974), Chupke Chupke (1975), and Mili (1975) are other classics from this period. S D Burman went into a coma soon after rehearsing the song Badi sooni sooni (sung by Kishore Kumar) for the film Mili. Sadly, He died on 31 October 1975 in Mumbai. On 1 October 2007, marking his 101st birth anniversary, India postal department released a commemorative postage stamp, in Agartala, where an exhibition on his life and work was also inaugurated; the state government of Tripura, also confers the yearly, 'Sachin Dev Burman Memorial Award' in Music Sachin Da was the only composer who had used both Kishore and Rafi in almost equal number of songs. He regarded Kishore as his second son. Kishore confessed that it was Sachin Da, who had given him the first chance. Even after the rehearsal of Badi Sooni Sooni from Milli, when Sachin Da had a stroke, Kishore went up to the hospital and said to him \"Dada, Please don't worry, your recording is after three days, you just see how well it goes.\" The song is considered one of the best of Kishore Kumar. Sachin Da also used to telephone Kishore in the dead of night and on the telephone, he would start to sing the new tunes which he composed and ask Kishore to sing with him. British singer of South Asian heritage, Najma Akhtar, recorded a Shanachie Records CD of Burman's work, Forbidden Kiss: The Music of S.D. Burman, an album of covers of Burman compositions. The Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar was named after the composer by Sachin's grandfather, who was an ardent fan of Burman. The singer and mimicry artist Sudesh Bhonsle frequently parodies the nasal high-pitched voice and quixotic singing style of S. D. Burman. Burman paired with tabla maestro late Brajen Biswas for his Bengali songs. The beats or 'thekas' created by Brajen Babu for these songs are unique and no one in the world can sing these songs in the original 'thekas'. All the thekas are according to the mood of the songs. But recently, painter, sculptor and singer Ramita Bhaduri sang the tough songs of Burman like 'Ami chhinu aka', 'Rangeela', 'Aankhi Duti Jhare' etc. in the original theka on the taleem of Brajen Biswas. The CD from 'Raga Music' (Symphony) was released at Kolkata Press Club. The CDs are available in M. Biswas & Symphony. Burman had a unique style of composing film songs. While most of the composers used harmonium or piano to compose the tune, he composed tunes using rhythm such as clapping hands. He was very fond of \"Paan\" which was specially made by his wife with a piece of dried orange peel and 'kevda' flower (Odoratissimus flower) for flavour and taste. In addition there were his chosen paanwalas (paan vendors) near Khar Station, his bungalow 'The Jet' and Bharati Vidya Bhavan from where he could get paans to his liking. That was the reason that he would not share his paan with anyone as he will run short of his paans. He would carry only few extra paana which he would give as a reward to the one whom he appreciated for work. SD Burman's first biography in English is 'Incomparable Sachin Dev Burman'. Written by HQ Chowdhury. It was published by Toitoomber from Dhaka, Bangladesh."

        "artist_name": "Shailendra_(lyricist)", 
        "biography": " Shankardas Kesarilal (30 August 1921\u00a0\u2013 14 December 1966), popularly known by his pen name Shailendra, was a popular Indian Hindi lyricist. Noted for his association with the filmmaker Raj Kapoor and the composers Shankar-Jaikishan, he wrote lyrics for several successful Hindi film songs in the 1950s and the 1960s.    Shailendra was born in Rawalpindi, and brought up in Mathura. The native place of his ancestors is located in the Akhtiyarpur, Ara district of Bihar. He came in contact with Indra Bahadur Khare at the Kishori Raman School. Both started composing poems, sitting on the rock located on the bank of a pond in between railway 27 quarters and railway line near to Mathura station. Afterwards Shailendra moved to Bombay for films and Indra Bahadur Khare got fame in Raashtreey Kavita. Shailendra started his career as an apprentice with Indian Railways in Matunga workshop, Mumbai (then Bombay) in 1947. He started writing poetry during these days. The filmmaker Raj Kapoor noticed Shailendra, when the latter was reading out his poem Jalta hai Punjab at a mushaira (poetic symposium). Kapoor offered to buy the poem Jalta Hai Punjab written by Shailendra and for his movie Aag (1948). Shailendra, a member of the left wing IPTA, was wary of mainstream Indian cinema and refused. However, after his wife became pregnant, Shailendra himself approached Raj Kapoor in need of money. At this time, Raj Kapoor was filming Barsaat (1949), and two of the film songs had not yet been written. For \u20b9 500, Shailendra wrote these two songs: Patli kamar hai and Barsaat mein. The music for Barsaat was composed by Shankar-Jaikishan.  The team of Raj Kapoor, Shailendra and Shankar-Jaikishan went on to produce many other hit songs. The song \"Awara Hoon\" from the 1951 film Awaara, written by Shailendra, became the most appreciated Hindustani film song outside India at the time. In the days when composers would recommend lyricists to producers, Shankar-Jaikishan once promised Shailendra that they would recommend him around, but didn't keep their promise. Shailendra sent them a note with the lines, Chhoti Si Yeh Duniya, Pehchaane Raaste Hain. Kahin To Miloge, toh Poochhenge Haal (\"The world is small, the roads are known. We'll meet sometime, and ask 'How do you do?'\"). Shankar-Jaikishan realised what the message meant and having said sorry, turned the lines into a popular song. The song was featured in the film Rangoli (1962), for which the producer Rajendra Singh Bedi wanted to sign up Majrooh Sultanpuri as the lyricist. However, Shankar-Jaikishen insisted on Shailendra and the producer had to oblige. Apart from Shankar-Jaikishan, Shailendra also shared a rapport with composers such as Salil Chowdhary (Madhumati), Sachin Dev Burman (Guide, Bandini, Kala Bazar), and Ravi Shankar (Anuradha). Apart from Raj Kapoor, he shared a rapport with filmmakers such as Bimal Roy (Do Bigha Zameen, Madhumati, Bandini) and Dev Anand (Guide and Kala Bazar). In 1961 Shailendra invested heavily in the production of the movie Teesri Kasam (1966), directed by Basu Bhattacharya and starring Raj Kapoor and Waheeda Rehman. The film won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film. However, the film was a commercial failure. The falling health resulting from tensions associated with film production and anxiety due to financial loss, coupled with alcohol abuse, ultimately led to his death. Shailendra's son Shaily Shailendra also became a lyricist. At the age of 17, Raj Kapoor asked him to complete his father's song Jeena yahan, marna yahan for the film Mera Naam Joker. Lyricist, writer, and director Gulzar has stated on many occasions that Shailendra was the best lyricist produced by the Hindi film industry. Shailendra won the Filmfare Best Lyricist Award three times. Some of the popular songs written by Shailendra include:"

Shailendra Singh was born in Mumbai, India to a Punjabi Family. He studied at Hill Grange High School at Peddar Road, and did his graduation from St. Xavier's College, Mumbai. He then joined the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune to train as an actor, but got his first break as a playback singer in the film, Bobby, during his second year at the FTII. Shailendra Singh had many hit songs to his credit. Raj Kapoor gave Singh a break when he signed him for Bobby. The song \"Main Shayar To Nahin\" became a big hit after which offers started pouring in. His song \"Humne Tumko Dekha\" from the film Khel Khel Mein rocked the entire nation. However, his popularity was short lived. His rendition of \"Jaane Do Na\" from Saagar along with Asha Bhosle added to the sensuality of the entire song, and ranks among the top sensuous numbers in Bollywood He tried his hand at acting in films like Agreement (with Rekha) and Do Jasoos, but those films flopped. He acted in a Bengali film \"Ajosro Dhanyobaad\", where Mohammad Rafi sang his only Bengali film song \"Nawal Kishoro Shyamo Sundoro\". Comment from Kaushik Maitra: This was not the only Bengali film song of Rafi saab. He had a song in film \"Haraano Sur\" also; composed by Nachiketa Ghosh Correction from Subrata Sengupta: Actually the Bengali film in which Md Rafi sang is \"Indrani\" \u2013 not \"Haraano Sur\" \u2013 The lyrics is \"Sabhi Kuchh Luta Ke\" and the music director was Nachiketa Ghosh.

        "artist_name": "Shamshad_Begum", 
        "biography": " Shamshad Begum (\u015aam\u015b\u0101d B\u0113gam; 14 April 1919 \u2013 23 April 2013) was an Indian singer who was one of the first playback singers in the Hindi film industry. She had a distinctive voice and was a versatile artist, singing over 6,000 songs in Hindi and Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil and Punjabi languages and of them 1287 songs were Hindi film songs. She worked with maestros including Naushad Ali, S. D. Burman, C. Ramchandra and O. P. Nayyar. Her songs from the 1940s to the early 1970s remain popular and continue to be remixed.   Begum was born in Lahore of modernday Pakistan on 14 April 1919, the day after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place in nearby Amritsar city. She was one of eight children, five sons and three daughters, born to a conservative Muslim family of limited means. Her father, Mian Hussain Baksh Maan, worked as a mechanic, and her mother, Ghulam Fatima, was a pious lady of conservative disposition, a devoted wife and mother who raised her children with traditional family values. In 1932, the teenage Shamshad came in contact with Ganpat Lal Batto, a Hindu law student who lived in the same neighbourhood and who was several years older than her. In those days, marriages were performed while the bride and groom were very young, and Shamshad's parents were already looking out for a suitable alliance for her. Their efforts were on the verge of bearing fruit in 1934 when Ganpat Lal Batto and Shamshad made the decision to marry each other. In 1934, despite strenuous opposition from both their families due to religious differences, 15-year-old Shamshad got married to Ganpat Lal Batto. The couple were blessed with only a single child, a daughter named Usha, who in due course married a Hindu gentleman, Lieutenant Colonel Yogesh Ratra, an officer in the Indian Army. In 1955, Ganpal Lal Batto died suddenly in a road accident. His death left Shamshad very distraught, because her husband had been the focus of her life and they had both been extremely devoted to each other. He had handled many aspects of her career and contracts and had been a major positive energy behind her career progression. After his death, Shamshad became listless and lost the fighting spirit to pursue her career, which registered a sharp decline thereafter. Indeed, while Shamshad Begum was both an outstanding singer and a successful famous one, she was at some deeper level always a wife and mother first, someone who instinctively prioritised her family over her career. By nature, she preferred to keep away from the public glare and from business dealings, taking the view that it was rather unseemly for a lady to be involved in such things. After her husband's death, Shamshad Begum began living with her daughter and son-in-law in Mumbai, first in south Mumbai and later at Hiranandani Gardens in the Powai neighbourhood. She gradually became a recluse and devoted herself entirely to her grandchildren, to the point that the general public was unaware of whether she was alive or dead. In 2004, a controversy erupted in the media, when several publications wrongly reported that Shamshad Begum had died a few years previously. Shamshad's family clarified in a press release that this was not so; and it later emerged that the Shamshad Begum who had died in 1998 was Saira Banu's maternal grandmother. Her self-imposed seclusion is remarkable, because during all those decades away from the public eye, her old songs remained popular with the public and not a day passed without at least a couple of songs being played on Vividh Bharati and All India Radio. Begum's talent was first spotted by her principal when she was in primary school in 1924. Impressed by the quality of her voice, she was made head singer of classroom prayer. At 10, she started singing folk-based songs at religious functions and family marriages. She received no formal musical training. Her singing ambitions, which she held from 1929, met with opposition from her family. In 1931, when she was twelve(16), her uncle, who enjoyed qawwalis and ghazals, secretly took her to Jenophone (or Xenophone) Music Company for an audition with Lahore-based musician and composer, Ghulam Haider. Begum said in an interview, \"I sang Bahadur Shah Zafar's (the poet-ruler) ghazal Mera yaar mujhe mile agar.\" An impressed Haider gave her a contract for twelve songs, with facilities provided to top singers. It was Begum's paternal uncle Ameer Khan who convinced her father, Miya Hussain Baksh, to allow her to sing. When she won a contract with a recording company, her father agreed to let her sing on the condition that she would record in a burka and not allow herself to be photographed. She earned 15 rupees per song and was awarded 500 on the completion of the contract on Xenophone. Xenophone was a renowned music recording company, patronised by the rich, and her popularity grew in elite circles in the early 1930s. It was from Hussain Bakshwale Sahab and later Ghulam Haider who improved her singing skills. Though she had won the Xenophone audition without taking any formal music training but after that both Ghulam Haider and later Hussain Bakshwale Sahab improved her singing skills between 1937 and 1939. Her popular breakthrough came when she began singing on All India Radio (AIR) in Peshawar and Lahore from 1937. Producer Dilsukh Pancholi wanted her to act as well in a film he was producing. Begum readily agreed, gave a screen test and was selected. Her father became angry when he found out and warned her that she would not be allowed to sing if she continued to harbour a desire to act. Begum promised her father that she would never appear before the camera. She continued to sing songs on radio. She never posed for photographs, and few people saw her picture between 1933 and the 1970s. Begum sang for AIR through her musical group 'The Crown Imperial Theatrical Company of Performing Arts', set up in Delhi. The then AIR Lahore helped her to enter the world of movies as they frequently broadcast her songs, which induced music directors to use her voice for their films. Begum also recorded naats and devotional music for a couple of gramophone recording companies. Her crystal-clear voice caught the attention of sarangi maestro Hussain Bakshwale Saheb, who took her as his disciple. Mehboob Khan brought Shamshad Begum to Mumbai after telling her husband 'I will take her to Mumbai and give her a flat, car, conveyance and even if four to six people accompany her, it's fine. Please let her come to Mumbai'. Her father was not convinced at first but later gave in as Shamshad wanted to come to Mumbai. Haider used her voice skilfully in some of his earlier films such as Khazanchi (1941) and Khandan (1942). By 1940, Begum was already well established on radio. The songs \"Cheechi Wich Pa ke Chhalla\", \"Mera Haal Vekh Ke\" and \"Kankaan Diyaan Faslaan\" from Yamla Jatt of 1940 became a huge hit and popularised Pran, singer Begum and composer Haider. Haider continued to compose hit songs which Begum sang for films including Zamindar, Poonji and Shama. Director Mehboob Khan used Begum's voice in Taqdeer (1943), where he introduced Nargis as the heroine. Begum was soon singing for other composers including Rafiq Ghaznavi, Ameer Ali, Pt Gobindram, Pt Amarnath, Bulo C. Rani, Rashid Atre and M. A. Mukhtar, in the pre-independence era. When Haider moved to Bombay in 1944, Begum went with him as a member of his team, leaving behind her family and staying with her Chacha (paternal uncle). After partition, Haider migrated to Pakistan but Begum remained in Mumbai. She had no known Pakistani connection post 1947. Begum became a national star between the early 1940s and the early 1960s, having a voice different from her peers such as Noorjehan (also discovered by Haider), Mubarrak Begum, Suraiya, Sudha Malhotra, Geeta Dutt and Amirbai Karnataki. Her peak period in the Hindi film industry was from 1940 to 1955 and again from 1957 to 1968. Begum sang extensively for composers including Naushad Ali, O. P. Nayyar, C. Ramchandra and S. D. Burman from 1946 to 1960. Naushad acknowledged in an interview that he was indebted to Begum in reaching the top, as she was famous before he became known in the late 1940s; after his tracks sung by her became highly popular, his talent was recognised. It was Begum's solo and duet songs sung for Naushad in the late 1940s and early 1950s which made Naushad famous. After Naushad became successful he recorded songs with new singers as well in the early 1950s, but kept working with Shamshad in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Naushad chose his favourite singer Begum once again to sing four out of the twelve songs in Mother India. Begum is credited with singing one of the first Westernised songs, \"Meri jaan...Sunday ke Sunday\" by Ramchandra. She kept getting more offers to sing songs and was the highest paid female singer from 1940 to 1955 and again post Mother India in 1957 to 1964. In 1949, music directors S. Rajeshwara Rao, M. D. Parthasarathy and Balakrishna Kalla asked her to sing \"Jaiyo Jaiyo Shipayon Bazar\" for P. Bhanumati in the film Nishan, produced by Gemini Films of Madras, which became highly popular. Although Burman started composing Bengali music in 1937, he achieved national fame with tracks sung by Begum in Hindi films. Burman was not well established as a music director in Hindi films until 1946; he then asked Begum to sing in his debut Hindi film as music director, Shikari (1946), with the song, \"Kuch Rang Badal Rahi\". In 1949, came Shabnam, in which Burman asked her to sing duets named \"Pyar Main Tumne\" and \"Kismat Bhi Bhichadna\" with Mukesh, which became popular. Shabnam was Burman's biggest hit to that date with Filmistan, and was especially noticeable for its multilingual song \"Yeh Duniya Roop ki Chor\", sung by Begum and acted by Kamini Kuashal, which became another hit. Burman subsequently asked her to sing tracks in Bazar (1950), Mashaal (1950), Bahar (1951), Shahenshah (1953), Miss India (1957), and other films. The song \"Jaam Tham Le\" from Shahenshah was a trendsetter for Burman compositions. Begum had met Nayyar during her radio stint in Lahore, when he worked as an office boy delivering cakes for the lead singers. In 1954, when Nayyar got a break as a composer, he approached Begum to record songs for Mangu. Nayyar described her voice as resembling a \"temple bell\" for its clarity of tone. He worked with her until the late 1960s and gave her many hit songs, including \"Ab To Jee Hone Laga\" from Mr. & Mrs. '55, \"Main Jaan Gayi Tujhe\" from Howrah Bridge, \"Zara Pyar Karle\" from Mangu (1954), \"Saiyan Teri Ankhon Mein\" from 12' O Clock (1957), \"Thodasa Dil Lagana\" from Musafirkhana, and many others. Several of her songs from this period remain extremely popular, including those acted by Nigar Sultana, such as \"Teri Mehfil Mein\" from Mughal E Azam and \"Mere Piyan Gaye\" from Patanga (1949), as well as \"Saiyan Dil Mein Aana Re\", acted by Vyjantimala, and \"Boojh Mera Naam Hai\", acted by Minoo Mumtaz. \"Milte hi aankhen dil hua\" from Babul (1950) had a romantic duet with Talat Mahmood, acted by Dilip Kumar and Munawar Sultana, which also became popular. Her duet with Rafi, \"Chhala Deja Nishani\" from Bazar (1949) became a mega-hit. In the late 1940s, Madan Mohan and Kishore Kumar sang as chorus boys for her songs at the Filmistan Studio. Bergum promised at this time that she would sing songs composed by Mohan once he started his career as a music director and would accept a lower fee. She also predicted that Kumar would become a great playback singer. She later recorded duets with Kumar, including \"Gori ke Nainon Mein Nindiya Bhari\" from Angarey (1954) and \"Mere Neendon Me Tum\" from Naya Andaz. Shamshad was at the peak of her career right from 1940 to 1955 and was the most in demand female singer and highest paid female playback singer from 1940-1955but after her husband's accidental death in 1955, Begum became a recluse and stopped accepting singing assignments, including recordings, for a year. Though she had stopped recording for her songs in the year 1955 after her husband's death, the songs released between 1955 and early 1957 including songs from films such as CID, Naya Andaz, Baradari, Mr. & Mrs. '55 and other hits. continued to be popular . At this juncture Mehboob Khan approached her in 1957 and said he wanted a full-throated voice for Nargis in Mother India. The first song she sang after returning to her career was \"Pee ke ghar aaj pyari dulhaniya chali\" for Mother India. She made a successful comeback, and subsequently recorded many notable songs for films such as Howrah Bridge, Jaali Note, Love in Simla, Bewaqoof, Mughal-e-Azam, Bluff Master, Gharana and Rustom-E-Hind.[citation needed] The well-known later playback singer, Lata Mangeshkar, started to sing when Begum was at the peak of her career, and Begum's break after her husband's death boosted Mangeshkar's career, helping her to be offered high-quality songs. In the early careers of Mangeshkar, as well as her younger sister, Asha Bhosle, between 1944 and 1956, they had often been asked by producers and music directors to imitate Begum's style of singing, because producers could not afford Begum's fees. In their first song together, Mangeshkar was a part of the chorus while Begum was the main singer. Many of the songs sung by Lata like Ayega Ayega have been sung in Shamshad Begum style. Even Asha Bhosle's songs like her first duet with Kishore \u2013 Aati Hai Yaad Humko from 1948 film Muqaddar bear direct resemblance to Shamshad Begum style. From 1949 to 1960, beginning with the song \"Dar Na Mohabbat Karle\" from Andaz (1949), Mangeshkar and Begum have sung many duets together, with the most famous being \"Pyar Ke Jahan Ki\" from the 1949 film Patanga, \"Bachpan Ke Din\" from 1951's Deedar; their last song together was Mughal-e-Azam's song \"Teri Mehfil Mein Qismat\" in 1960. Begum has sung songs together with Mangeshkar and Bhosle, including \"Mubarak Ho Woh Dil Jisko\" from Benazir (1964). It was the period between 1958 and 1963, that career of Lata got major boost as music directors started gradually preferring her soft voice, until then Geeta Dutt and Begum were the most preferred singers but Shamshad Begum continued to be at the top from 1940 till 1963 non-stop.[citation needed] From 1965, her songs started to be mimed by actresses other than the heroine. From 1965, songs for her in films started getting reduced but the songs she sang instantly became hits till 1968. She then declared a self-imposed retirement in 1965. But she kept having certain composers asking her to sing songs in few films and among them her songs from films like in Daku Mangal Singh, Upkar, Kismat (1969), Heer Ranjha (1970), Johar Mehmood in Hong Kong (1971), Teri Meri Ik Jindri (1975) and Main Papi Tum Bakhshanhaar (1976). Her song \"Kajra Mohabbat Wala\" from the 1968 film Kismat and Nathaniya Hale To Bada Maza from the 1971 film Johar Mehmood in Hong Kong remains popular. From the late 1980s, Begum started giving occasional interviews. In one of her interviews to Filmfare magazine in 2012 Begum dislosed \"The more hits I gave, the less work I got. When I helped new composers I never told them to give me all their songs to sing. I believed only God could give, not them.\" Her final interview was in 2012. In 2009, she was conferred with the prestigious O. P. Nayyar award for her contribution to Hindi film music. She was also conferred the Padma Bhushan in 2009. Later her daughter Usha said in an interview \"\"Because of the politics in the industry, she didn't want to work any more. This is one of the reasons why she didn't let me be a singer. I told her, let me sing for my self-satisfaction, but she said if you will learn to sing, you will directly enter the industry. So, she didn't let me do so.\" Begum died at her Mumbai residence on the night of 23 April 2013 after a prolonged illness. She was 94. She was cremated in a small, dignified ceremony. Information and Broadcasting minister Manish Tewari said, \"The film industry has lost one of its most versatile singers. Shamshadji's style of singing set new benchmarks. Her melodious voice with powerful lyrics gave us songs that have remained popular even today.\" Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said \"She was an artist of extraordinary talent and abilities, and the songs she has left behind in her long career, which she started with AIR in 1937, will continue to enthral music lovers.\" Her daughter Usha Ratra said \"She kept herself away from glamour of the industry despite being one of the top singers of her era as she did not like limelight. My mother used to say that artistes never die. She wanted to be remembered for her songs.\""

        "artist_name": "Shankar_Jaikishan", 
        "biography": " Shankar Jaikishan (also known as S-J), were an Indian duo who composed music for the Hindi film industry, working together from 1949 to 1971. Later, Shankar continued to function as a Music Director alone, still giving music under the banner Shankar-Jaikishan, till 1987. Shankar-Jaikishan, along with other artists, composed \"everlasting\" and \"immortal melodies\" in the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s. Their best work was noted for being \"raga-based and having both lilt and sonority\".   Shankar Singh s/o ram singh (15 October 1922 \u2013 26 April 1987) was from Hyderabad. During his formative years, Shankar played the tabla and learned the art formally from Baba Nasir Khansahib. For many years, Shankar studied as a disciple of the legendary composer Khawaja Khurshid Anwar, in whose orchestra he performed. As per latest knowledge un-earthed by SJ Fans Association International (SJFAI), contrary to the adverse propaganda that he was illiterate and never went to school, as per his surviving close relatives (families of his sisters), this is not true. In fact, Shankar had studied at Hyderabad and had passed 10th class, before moving to Bombay. A 10th class pass of pre-independence era, cannot be considered to be illiterate by any means. Shankar started his career with a theater group run by Satyanarayan and Hemawati, before shifting to Prithvi Theatre where he played tabla and performed some minor roles in plays. Shankar worked as assistant to the leading composer duo of Husnlal Bhagatram. Jaikishan Dayabhai Panchal (4 November 1929 \u2013 12 September 1971) belonged to Bansda (Vansada), Gujarat. Jaikishan was adept at playing the harmonium. Subsequently, he obtained his musical lessons from Sangeet Visharad Wadilalji and later from Prem Shankar Nayak. After moving to Mumbai, he became a disciple of Vinayak Tambe. Apart from working at Prithvi theaters, Shankar used to frequently visit the office of a Gujrati director Chandravadan Bhatt who had promised Shankar a break as a Music Director when he produced a film. It was outside the office of Bhatt that Shankar saw Jaikishan a number of times. One day, he started a conversation and discovered that Jaikishan was a harmonium player, and that he too was visiting the same producer in search of work. Shankar later recollected that they developed a liking for each other and it was he who then and there assured Jaikishan of the job of a Harmonium player at Prithvi theaters (without asking Prithviraj Kapoor, fondly referred to as 'Papaji'). Papaji honoured Shankar's selection and gladly accepted Jaikishan as a Harmonium player at Prithvi. Soon, the two of them developed very close friendship to the extent that the people started referring to them as 'Ram-Lakshman' ki jodi and by several similar-meaning nicknames. Apart from following their musical pursuits, they also used to play significant roles in various plays including the famous play \"Pathan\". While working in Prithvi Theaters, Shankar and Jaikishan used to compose tunes and were in touch with Raj Kapoor, who was working as an assistant to the famous director Kidar Sharma and was aspiring to be an actor/director. Thus, the three had met at Prithvi Theater. Raj Kapoor made his debut as a director with the film Aag in 1948. Its music director Ram Ganguly was assisted by Shankar and Jaikishan. However, during the recording of a song for his new venture Barsaat, Raj Kapoor had some serious differences with Ram Ganguly and decided to assign its music to Shankar who insisted on taking Jaikishan as his partner. Thus came into existence the new pair of music directors named 'Shankar-Jaikishan' who composed the music for the film. Himself being a trained singer (he and Mukesh learned vocal music from the same Guru), Raj Kapoor thus took on board a new team of composers Shankar and Jaikishan and lyricists Shailendra and Hasrat Jaipuri (a former bus conductor). On the insistence of Shankar, he and SJ co-opted the upcoming singing talent Lata Mangeshkar, and repeated Mukesh as Raj Kapoor's ghost voice for the various songs of Barsaat. The film also had the distinction of featuring two firsts in Hindi cinema \u2014 a title song (\"Barsaat Mein Humse Mile\") and a cabaret (\"Patli Kamar Hai\"). The two became known by the acronym \"S-J\". Their early works include Barsaat, Awaara, Badal, Poonam, Nagina, Aurat, Parbat, Kaali Ghataa, Aah, Patita, Shikast, Badshah, Mayur Pankh, Naya Ghar, Seema, Shree 420, Basant Bahar, Halaku, Rajhath, New Delhi, Kathputli, Anari, Chori Chori, Daag, Begunah, Yahudi, Main Nashe main hoon, Kanaiah, Boot Polish, Chhoti Behan, Sharaarat, Love Marriage, and Ujala.[citation needed] S-J formed a core team with lyricists Shailendra (himself regarded as perhaps the greatest of his ilk) and Hasrat Jaipuri and with singers Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar. SJ had two other lifelong companions who worked as their assistants: Dattaram Wadkar and Sebastian D'Souza, the former supervising their rhythm section and the later writing musical notations for all SJ compositions (during SJ's musical sittings as can be seen in a number of photographs of such sessions) and then rehearsing all the musicians of the grand SJ orchestra according to SJ's compositions and directions. SJ also patronized the immensely talented singer Manna Dey, who sang his best songs with them and used Mukesh's silken voice as playback for Raj Kapoor. Among the directors, they worked most closely with Raj Kapoor and were considered the kingpins of his legendary banner RK Films. They were commercial geniuses in addition to be wonderfully god-blessed on music. They lead the Bollywood music in spite of tough competition from maestros like Roshan, SD Burman, OP Nayyar and Madanmohan and remained on the top much to the chagrin of very highly talented music directors! S-J worked with almost all singers of their time. They had a good working relationship with all of them and were masters in extracting the very best from every one of them. They were steady as a team with Hasrat Jaipuri & Shailendra as their lyricists; but after the demise of Shailendra, they worked with a host of other lyricists such as Indeevar, Gulshan Bawra, Gopaldas Neeraj, Verma Malik, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Vithhal Bhai Patel and Rajinder Krishan, to name a few. S-J were the \"house composers\" for RK Films and were on their pay-roll till the end. Raj Kapoor used to maintain a music bank where he stored compositions of S-J.[citation needed] Even after the termination of the professional association between Shankar and Raj Kapoor (Jaikishan had died by then), the latter had used a number of S-J's earlier compositions (which were in his custody) for all his films though the credits were given officially to other composers, e.g., Laxmikant Pyarelal (Bobby, Satyam Shivam Sundaram, Prem Rog) and Ravindra Jain (Ram Teri Ganga Maili). S-J also worked with other stars like Shammi Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar, Dev Anand, Sunil Dutt, Kishore Kumar, Manoj Kumar, Biswajeet, Joy Mukherjee, Dharmendra & Manoj Kumar.Beside them S-J combo works above all of with Mohd Rafi and secondly Mukesh, produced numbers of hits and unmatchable gems. Mohd Rafi was their favourite singer despite having good reputation with other playback singers of its time. Most of S-J's films show Dattaram and Sebastian as their assistants. Dattaram handled the percussion section of the orchestra and composed original beats, and Sebastian handled the rest. Shankar met Dattaram when the latter was a page boy at Prithvi Theatres and stayed with him throughout. As recalled by Dattaram, Sebastian composed the musical background of most of S-J's songs and also conducted the orchestra. Thus S-J were fortunate to have top quality assistants and used their talents well. Shankar-Jaikishan's compositions broke new ground in Hindi film music. Apart from relying upon their knowledge of Indian classical music, they also employed western beats and orchestration. Shankar-Jaikishan were the pioneers in establishing the role of the orchestra in song compositions as a medium to express and enhance the meanings and feelings of songs rather than using it just as a `filler' as per the prevalent practice before their advent on the scene. They made use of the orchestra and musical instruments (often dozens or hundreds of them) in their songs which consisted of the following format: The song starts with a `prelude' (preparatory music to create and introduce the environment and mood for the beginning of the song), then the mukhda starts and is followed by 'interlude' containg music pieces on the orchestra. With very few exceptions(\"Ye mera deewana pan hai\" is a good example), they always used different interludes before each stanza. 'Multi-layered' music studded with counter melodies' played by the orchestra accompanied while the mukhda or the antara of a song was being sung and finally came the `epilogue' - the music with which the song ended after the singer(s) had finished their singing. Shankar-Jaikishan made a significant contribution in promoting Indian classical music throughout their career. It was their established practice to have at least one song in a movie based on semi-classical style. These included songs like `Jhanak-jhanak tori baje payaliya' (Mere Huzoor), `Chham chham baje re payaliya' (Jane-anjane), `Radhike tune bansari churayi' (Beti Bete), `Manmohana bade jhoothe' (old `Seema'), `Koi matwala aya mere dware' (Love in Tokyo), `Ajahu na ayae baalma, sawan beeta jaye' (Sanjh aur Savera), `Lapak jhpak tu aa re badarwa' (Boot polish), `Ye barkha bahar sautaniya ke dwar' (Mayur pankh), `Re man sur mein ga' (Lal pathar), `Sooni sooni sans ke sitar par' (Naina), `Kate na kate raina' (Mera naam joker) and numerous others. Their music in `Basant Bahar' and Amrapali both of which had every song based upon Indian classical music. While \"raga Bhairavi\" remained their perennial favorite, SJ used a variety of Raagas in their compositions. Shankar Jaikishan also used the western classical-based waltz rhythm in a number of songs. Shankar-Jaikishan gave a new style and meaning to the genre of sad songs by composing them on a fast tempo. Songs like \"Zindagi Mein Hardam Rota Hi Raha\" (Barsaat), \"Tera Jana Dil Ke Armanon\" (Anari), \"Haye Tu Hi Gaya Mohe Bhool Re\" (Kathputli), \"Aye Mere Dil Kahin Aur Chal' (Daag) and \"Andhe Jahan Ke Andhe Raate\" (Patita) demonstrated this. The last two songs, along with many others (notably \"Awaara Hoon\" from the film Awaara), also demonstrate the composers\u2019 use of musical instruments \u2013 a harmonium is used to produce the effect of a piano accordion. \"We have never thought of the public as the 'masses', but as individuals who want the best from us\" While working as a team, Shankar and Jaikishan used to compose their songs separately. Generally, Shankar liked to work with Shailendra and Jaikishan with Hasrat Jaipuri though there are notable instances where Shankar worked with Hasrat and Jaikishan with Shailendra. Between the two, Shankar was the senior partner and hence, he would usually arrange the orchestra, even for Jaikishan's songs. There was a gentleman's agreement between them for not identifying the actual composer of the song. As a result, it has been a popular pastime for S-J aficionados to try to tell a Shankar song from a Jaikishan song. Dance numbers, title/theme songs and soulful songs were Shankar's forte while Jaikishan was a master of composing background score, apart from romantic songs (he is generally regarded as the best ever in this genre) and simple, catchy compositions which became instant hits (\"Ehsaan Mere Dil Pe\" being a typical example of such songs). However, Shankar was no less in this aspect of devising simple 'straight line' tunes: \"Mera Joota Hai Japani\" (Sri 420) being the best example of this genre. It is said that Jaikishan would count some numbers on his fingers before coming up with the background score for a particular scene on the spot! Two of S-J's films, viz., Sangam (1964) and Mera Naam Joker (1971) are regarded even today as having some of the best background musical scores of Hindi films till date. Although, by and large, it was Jaikishan who used to work on background music of SJ movies as per their mutually agreed division of work, it may be an over-simplification to presume that therefore, whatever went in background scores was solely Jaikishan's creation. Since SJ had a common pool of tunes in their stock, made by either of them during their numerous music sessions/sittings (Riyaz), it was perfectly legitimate and natural for Jaikishan to have used tunes created by Shankar also wherever needed. It is understood that in RK films, Shankar and Jaikishan both used to work on the background scores. On the other hand, both Shankar and Jaikishan were equally proficient in scoring western music based songs. Despite their distinct working styles and preferences, it is very difficult, if not altogether impossible, to ascribe most of their songs to only one of them. In most of the songs, they invariably contributed to one another's creation, either in the form of improvisation of tune or of orchestration, thus, making their compositions truly a joint effort. Furthermore, each of the two could compose in other's style now and then thereby making the identification still more difficult. Contrary to the popular mis-conception that `it was Jaikishan who used to handle the public relations and business/financial aspects of the duo's career', the fact is that it was Shankar who had the final say on all financial/business aspects of the SJ-team. Shankar Jaikishan made a major contribution towards the development of jazz music in India and the new genre Indo jazz. Their 1968 album Raaga-Jazz style is the earliest Indo-jazz recording in India. In this album, considered to be one of the most innovative, SJ created 11 songs based on Indian Ragas with saxophone, trumpet, sitar (by Rais Khan), tabla, bass etc. During their career, S-J won Filmfare Best Music Director Awards nine times. The last three awards were won in three successive years, thereby making S-J the first composers to score a hat trick of these awards. S-J also came out tops in Binaca Geetmala, the legendary countdown radio program on Hindi film music, where their compositions were declared the most popular on six occasions (a record later equaled by Laxmikant Pyarelal). These songs were \"Mera Joota Hai Japani\" in 1955 (Shree 420), \"Teri Pyari Pyari Surat Ko\" in 1961 (Sasural), \"Ehsaan Tera Hoga Mujh Par\" in 1962 (Junglee), \"Bol Radha Bol\" in 1964 (Sangam), \"Baharon Phool Barsaao\" in 1966 (Suraj), and \"Zindagi Ek Safar Hai Suhana\" in 1971 (Andaaz). In 1959, seven of the top ten songs for the year were composed by S-J, a sort of record that stands perhaps to this date, though the top honors for that year went to SD Burman. Winner Winner Winner In a signed article in Filmfare, Jaikishan identified unwittingly the song \"Yeh Mera Prem Patra Padh Kar\" (Sangam) as 'his' composition. This led to a lot of bitterness between the two, as Shankar considered it a violation of the unwritten agreement between them. At about the same time, Shankar gave a break to singer Sharda and started promoting her as the new singing sensation in preference over Lata Mangeshkar. Jaikishan, however, stuck to Lata Mangeshkar for his compositions. In this period, Shankar and Jaikishan started taking individual contracts for films though every such film continued to show them together as the composers. Mohd. Rafi intervened and helped them settle their differences; however, it is conjectured that their relationship was not same as earlier and this impacted the quality of their compositions which had started exhibiting a decline (which is clearly noticeable in the movies released during the last phases of Jaikishan's lifetime and those released just after his demise). On the other hand, Jaikishan, Hasrat and Shankar all had denied, whenever quizzed on this topic, that there ever was any rift between them. In fact, according to Hasrat, the division of work was by mutual agreement to cope up with the heavy work load so that Shankar and Shailendra looked after one part of the work while Jaikishan and Hasrat on the other part but this division was not rigid; there was a lot of give and take between them even during this phase. Towards the end (just before Jaikishan's untimely demise), in several of their last movies such as Jane Anjane (1971), Andaaz (1971), Ankhon Ankhon Mein, Shankar and Jaikishan were known to be working together. In retrospect, it appears that the so-called rift between Shankar and Jaikishan was blown out of proportion by the media and vested interests and was used later to downgrade Shankar in his post-Jaikishan years. Since Shankar continued to support Sharda (post Sangam era) and even ghost-composed music for her film and non-film albums, it is said that Lata Mangeshkar became angry with him and discontinued singing for him. Whereas there may be some truth in this assertion, the other fact is that Lata Mangeshkar had stopped working with him after Sangam due to her anger against both Raj Kapoor and Shankar in making her sing \"Budhha Mil Gaya\" from Sangam which she was not keen as she did not feel comfortable with the lyrics of the song. Nevertheless, she continued singing for Jaikishan even after Sangam and till the end. S-J enjoyed an unrivaled position in the Hindi film industry. During their heyday and even toward the later part of their career, they were the highest paid music directors in the industry. Barring stray exceptions, they were paid more than the leading actors and the promotional material of their films would give them more prominence than anyone else. S-J staged a show in Shanmukhanad Hall, Mumbai in 1970 under the aegis of the Indian Navy. In terms of attendance and grandeur, it remains unsurpassed to this day, thus providing a public seal of approval to their leading status in the industry. \"What can I say... my musical partner in life has gone, what is left of me to say anything more, I had never thought that at such an early age he would leave us all and go; Anyway his good qualities of maintaining goodwill, giving love and receiving love were innate in him and I too don't have them in me. He used to regularly remind me of my innate quality of being in a boisterous mood all the time and always abrasive with some one or the other and so on and so forthwith.......\" Jaikishan died in 1971 due to cirrhosis of liver, a disease caused by excessive consumption of alcohol. At the time of his death, the duo enjoyed an unparalleled popularity which was underlined by a massive turnout at his funeral procession. Gaylord, a restaurant at Churchgate (Mumbai) where Jaikishan used to be a regular visitor, mourned the death of its illustrious patron by lighting a candle on his favorite table for one month and keeping it out of bounds for other guests with the sign \"Reserved for Mr. Jaikishan\". After Jaikishan's death, Shankar carried on with the banner of Shankar-Jaikishan alone (as per their mutual understanding made during their lifetime that in case of the demise of any one of them, the surviving partner will continue to work with the same team name). He was clearly hampered by numerous reasons such as the departures of his soul-mate Jaikishan and his favorite lyricist Shailendra, betrayal of Raj Kapoor, continued Shankar-bashing and false propaganda by his rivals and lack of motivation on his own part due to which his music appeared to suffer in comparison to S-J's own high standards. Also, in spite of his continued experimentation on music, the projects themselves for which he worked did not turn out to be commercial successes due to which even his good scores went largely un-noticed. According to Lata Mangeshkar herself, it was the late Mohd. Rafi who brought about a rapprochement between the two and she did start singing again for Shankar starting from Sohan Lal Kanwar's `Sanyasi' and several other films later. Although Shankar's creations during this period for Lata as well as other singers like Rafi, Kishore, Manna Dey were quite good, most of these went un-noticed due to non-descript status of such films which bombed at the box office. His most-successful musical hit was Sanyasi in 1975 for which he scored all songs and the entire background score based upon SJ's favorite Raag Bhairavi to prove the point that SJ's Bhairavi was as much Shankar's as that of Jaikishan. After Sanyasi, although some of Shankar's later songs did exhibit flashes of the old maestro's brilliance, overall, these films (Aatmaram, Do-Jhooth, Garam Khoon, Papi Pet Ka Sawal Hai, Chorni, Eint ka Jawab Pathar) did not succeed in endearing him to leading production houses, though there were some exceptions. For example, actor Dharmendra had signed Shankar to compose the score for his film Bichchoo, however, since Shankar did not accept Sai's (who was more keen in having Raj Kamal as MD) interference in his work, he opted out of the project. Eventually, the project itself was abandoned by Dharmendra. Shankar was in the running for Raj Kapoor's film Satyam Shivam Sundaram (1978), but was overlooked in favor of Laxmikant Pyarelal whose candidature was supported vigorously by Mukesh. Ironically, Mukesh owed his standing in the film industry primarily to S-J's compositions. Shankar was also considered for Raj Kapoor's proposed film Param Vir Chakra (his case was supported by Raj Kapoor's sons), but the project did not see the light of day and Shankar never returned to the RK camp. Shankar died in 1987. His death received nominal media coverage and his funeral was attended only by his family and some friends. The film industry was hardly represented at his funeral (even Raj Kapoor did not attend), thus reinforcing the stereotype of its fickle-natured loyalties. Raj Kapoor later paid glowing tributes to the colleague of his salad days in a televised interview. However, it was only after Raj Kapoor's own death in 1988 that the significance of his association with Shankar Jaikishan was brought out in great detail. Chandrakant Bhosle first noticed Shankarji, as Shankar was popularly known among his friends, in Mumbai in 1945 when Shankarji arrived in Mumbai with balle troup of guru Krishnankutty and dancer Hemawati. Bhosle was a 'tabla' player and had become closely associated with Shankarji. He used to play 'rhythm' in Shankarji's orchestra from 1945 until Shankarji's death. A night before Shankarji's death, i.e. on 25 April 1987 Shankarji dropped Bhosle near Charni Road railway station where Bhosle stayed and drove off to his own residence at Churchgate. On 26 April Bhosle was, as usual, waiting for Shankarji at around 10.00 a.m. to take him to the studio, but Shankarji did not turn up so Bhosle went to the studio by taxi. All the musicians waited the whole day for Shankarji in the studio but he didn't turn up. The next day, Bhosle read the news of Shankarji's death. Unfortunately, family members with whom Shankarji was staying did not inform Bhosle, Raj Kapoor or anybody from the film fraternity about Shankarji's death. It was Mr. Gokhale, who was once a cook in Shankarji's house, who later became Pujari in Gora Ram Mandir at Thakurdwar, Mumbai, who informed people that Shankarji was cremated hastily on the day of his death, without the knowledge of others.[citation needed]"

Shreya Ghoshal was born on 12 March 1984 to a Bengali Hindu family in Murshidabad, Murshidabad district, West Bengal.[A] She grew up in Rawatbhata, a small town near Kota in Rajasthan. Her father, Bishwajit Ghoshal is an electrical engineer and works for the Nuclear Power Corporation of India, and her mother, Sarmistha Ghoshal, is a literature post-graduate. She has a younger brother, Soumyadeep Ghoshal. At the age of four, she started learning music.

She joined the Atomic Energy Junior College to study science. She withdrew from the junior college and enrolled at the SIES College of Arts, Science, and Commerce in Mumbai, where she took up arts with English as her major. Her mother used to help her in her rehearsals and she accompanied her on the Tanpura and started practicing mostly Bengali songs. At the age of six, Ghoshal started with her formal training in classical music. She acquired training from Padmashree Late Kalyanji Bhai and Late Mukta Bhideji. Her first stage performance was made at a club's annual function. When she turned six, she started her lessons in Hindustani classical music. In 2000, at the age of sixteen, she participated and won the television music reality show Sa Re Ga Ma (now Sa Re Ga Ma Pa) on the channel Zee TV. Her first studio album was Bendhechhi Beena, which was released on 1 January 1998, with 14 tracks. Some of her earlier albums are O Tota Pakhi Re, Ekti Katha (1999), and Mukhor Porag (2000). Ghoshal recorded Bengali studio album Rupasi Raate (2002). Ghoshal recorded devotional songs in albums like Banomali Re (2002), and later, Krishna Bina Ache Ke (2007). Ghoshal caught the attention of director Sanjay Leela Bhansali when she participated in the 75th children's special episode of Sa Re Ga Ma. Bhansali's mother was watching the show and during Ghoshal's performance, she called him to watch her performance, after which he decided to give her a chance in his next film. According to Bhansali, Ghoshal's voice had the innocence needed for the character of Paro in Devdas (2002). In 2000, Bhansali and music director Ismail Darbar offered her the opportunity to be the voice of Paro, the lead female character of Devdas, who was portrayed by Aishwarya Rai. Ghoshal sang five songs in the film, namely, \"Silsila Ye Chaahat Ka\", \"Bairi Piya\", \"Chalak Chalak\", \"Morey Piya\", and \"Dola Re Dola\", with established singers such as Kavita Krishnamurthy, Udit Narayan, Vinod Rathod, KK, and Jaspinder Narula. She was sixteen when she recorded the first song for the film, \"Bairi Piya\" with Udit Narayan. Her Higher Secondary Examinations were nearing that time and she would take her books and notebooks to the studio in order to study during downtime. \"Bairi Piya\" was an instant success and topped the charts. The film garnered her first Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer for \"Dola Re\" (shared with Kavita Krishnamurthy) and a National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer for \"Bairi Piya\". Her performance also won her the Filmfare RD Burman Award for New Music Talent. She was an immediate success and was called by various regional film industries for recording songs in her voice. Ghoshal was next heard in Darbar-composed Desh Devi, where she performed three tracks for the film.

According to Ghoshal, \"Jaadu Hai Nasha Hai\" and \"Chalo Tumko Lekar Chale\" from the film \"made everyone look at [her] in a new light\", opening the doors to a \"versatile image\". She was awarded with another Filmfare trophy for Best Female Playback Singer for the song \"Jaadu Hai Nasha Hai\". She thereupon worked with Anu Malik, where she performed the female version of \"Aye Meri Zindagi\", \"Seena Pada\" and \"Aai Jo Teri Yaad\", along with the bhajan-styled \"Har Taraf\".

In 2004, Ghoshal contributed to the soundtrack album of Thoda Tum Badlo Thoda Hum by performing four tracks, which were labelled with an \"average\" tag by Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama. However, he was \"impressed\" with Ghoshal's rendition from her songs in Khakee, where he affirmed that Ghoshal's voice suits Aishwarya Rai to the \"core\" and she \"lends credibility to the entire song\" in \"Wada Raha\". Besides, the two duets with Nigam; \"Dil Dooba\" and \"Youn Hi Tum Mujhse\", were equally favored by music critics. Further complimenting her vocals in the song \"Hum Tumko Nigahon Mein\" and \"Soniye\" from Garv, Tuteja asserted that Ghoshal's \"vocals have started to suit the current breed of actresses better and better with each passing day\". Apart from Dil Bechara Pyaar Ka Maara, Ghoshal worked with Nikhil\u2013Vinay in other projects, by recording \"Betab Dil Hai\" from Phir Milenge, and \"Woh Ho Tum\" from Muskaan. During the time, Nadeem\u2013Shravan composed Tumsa Nahin Dekha: A Love Story was considered to be the biggest album for Ghoshal, as she sang all the numbers with an exception of one song.

Ghoshal was bestowed with her second National Film Award for her rendition of \"Dheere Jalna\" in Paheli. As claimed by Daily News and Analysis, the song \"treads the fine balance between the classical and popular genre of Hindi film music\". Barring the song \"Dheere Jalna\", Ghoshal was heard in two other tracks \"Kangna Re\" and \"Minnat Kare\", composed by M.M. Kreem. She provided vocals for Kreem in one of his another compositions: \"Guzar Na Jaye\" from Rog. With the film Parineeta, she made her first collaboration with Shantanu Moitra.

Reportedly, Ghoshal was selected to sing the female rendition of the track after being auditioned by many other artistes. In an interview, Moitra stated; \"Pradeep wanted a little trill of laughter in the middle of the song and she did it effortlessly\". Along with \"Piyu Bole\", Ghoshal received another Filmfare nomination for her rendition of the song \"Agar Tum Mil Jao\" from Zeher. The song along with \"Jaane Ja Jaane Ja\" from the same film was acclaimed by music critics. Apart from providing supporting vocals for Himesh Reshammiya's \"Aashiq Banaya Aapne\", Ghoshal's voice had been used in some of his other compositions released during the year. However, while reviewing Malik-composed \"Pehle Se\", Bollywood Hungama wrote: \"Ghoshal sings in a mature manner and does well once again to prove herself as a dependable playback singer\". Similar sentiments were echoed for the song \"Bolo To\" from Shabd which was composed by Vishal\u2013Shekhar. 2006 marks Ghoshal's first collaboration with Ravindra Jain in film Vivah, where she performed three duets with Narayan titled \"Mujhe Haq Hai\", \"Do Anjaane Ajnabi\" and \"Milan Abhi Aadha Adhura Hai\".

During the year, Ghoshal performed her first ever duet with Sunidhi Chauhan\u2014though they have contributed in multi-singer songs together\u2014with the Salim\u2013Sulaiman's composition, \"Imaan Ka Asar\" from Dor.

For the song, she received a Best Female Playback Singer nomination at the 52nd Filmfare Awards. She was next heard with Vishal Bhardwaj in the song \"O Saathi Re\", which exudes the feeling of intimacy and deep love. Ghoshal's low pitch rendition in the song was positively noted by critics. In 2006, Ghoshal sang \"Pyaar Ki Ek Kahani\", \"Koi Tumsa Nahin\" and \"Chori Chori Chupke Chupke\" for Rajesh Roshan-composed Krrish which were also favored by the critics. Reviewing the album, Bollywood Hungama wrote: \"Ghoshal is extremely competent and justifies her continued presence in the big league\". They also mentioned that Ghoshal has reached to a similar level of Alka Yagnik in terms of \"class, quality and style\". In 2007, Ghoshal recorded a thumri in the mujra style for Khoya Khoya Chand. Titled \"Chale Aao Saiyan\" and composed by Moitra, the song was particularly praised for Ghoshal's \"different\" vocal structure.

She also recorded her first track in a Sanjay Leela Bhansali's composition, \"Thode Badmaash\" for the same album, providing a \"feminine quality\" to her \"temperate nuances\".

        "artist_name": "Suman_Kalyanpur", 
        "biography": " Suman Kalyanpur (a.k.a. Suman Hemmady) (born 28 January 1937) is an Indian singer. She is one of the best-known and most respected playback singers in India. She succeeded in achieving recognition of her own during the years of Lata Mangeshkar's monopoly and sang under the baton of almost all the top composers of the period. Many people believe that she could not reach the stature and position which her talent really warranted, in spite of having all the mandatory characteristics required to make a mark in the field of playback singing like great knowledge of classical music, a melodious voice and a wide range. Her voice was often mistaken to be that of Lata Mangeshkar. Suman Kalyanpur's career started in 1954 and was very popular singer in the 1960s and 1970s. She recorded songs for movies in several languages besides Hindi, Marathi, Assamese, Gujarati, Kannada, Bhojpuri, Rajasthani, Bengali, Oriya and Punjabi. She was a bit unfortunate as she never won the National Film Awards or Filmfare Award for singing but is still considered among the popular singers of her prime time. She has sung a total of 857 Hindi songs.   Suman Kalyanpur (\u09b8\u09c1\u09ae\u09a8 \u0995\u09b2\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09a8\u09aa\u09c1\u09b0) was born on 28 January 1937 in Dhaka. Suman Kalyanpur's father Shankar Rao Hemadi hailed from an elite Saraswat Brahmin family belonging to Mangalore, Karnataka. Hemmady is a village in Kundapur Taluk of Udupi District , Karnataka. He served on a top post in the Central Bank of India and was posted to Dhaka (now Bangladesh) for a very long period. Apart from father and mother Seeta Hemmady, there were 5 daughters and one son in the family with Suman being the eldest among her siblings. She is an eminent Indian singer. In 1943, her family moved to Mumbai, where she received her musical training. Suman had always been interested in Painting and Music. After completing schooling from Mumbai\u2019s famed Columbia High School, She got admission in the prestigious Sir J. J. School of Arts for further studies in Painting. Simultaneously, she started learning classical vocal from Pune's Prabhat Films' music director and a close family friend, \u2018Pandit Keshav Rao Bhole\u2019. According to Suman, initially singing was just hobby to her but gradually her interest in music increased and she started learning it professionally from \u2018Ustad Khan Abdul Rehman Khan\u2019 and \u2018Guruji Master Navrang\u2019.  According to Suman, \"Everybody at home had an inclination towards arts and music but public performances were strictly prohibited. Still, I could not say 'no' to an offer to sing for the All India Radio in 1952. This was my first public performance after which I got a chance to sing for the Marathi film 'Shukrachi Chandni' released in the year 1953. At that time, Sheikh Mukhtar was making the film 'Mangu' whose composer was \u2018Mohammed Shafi\u2019. Sheikh Mukhtar was so impressed with my \u2018Shukrachi Chandni\u2019 songs, that he got me to sing 3 songs for the film \u2018Mangu\u2019. However, due to some unknown reasons, later \u2018O.P,Nayyar\u2019 replaced \u2019Mohammed Shafi\u2019 and only one of my 3 songs, a lullaby \u201cKoi Pukaare Dheere Se Tujhe\u201d was retained in the film. Thus, I entered Hindi cinema with the 1954 release \u2018Mangu\u2019.\" Immediately after the film \u2018Mangu\u2019, Suman sang 5 songs under the baton of composer \u2018Nashaad\u2019 for the film \u2018Darwaza\u2019 (1954), which was produced by Ismat Chugtai and directed by Shahid Lateef. Since \u2018Darwaza\u2019 released first, it is generally believed to be Suman Kalyanpur\u2019s first Hindi film. In the same year (1954), Suman sang the film version of O.P.Nayyar\u2019s hit ensemble song \u2018Mohabbat Kar Lo Ji Bhar Lo Aji Kisne Roka Hai\u2019 with Rafi and Geeta Dutt for the film \u2018Aar Paar\u2019. According to Suman, She had a couple of solo lines to sing and her services were used, more, as a chorus singer in this song. This proved to be the only song she ever sang for O.P.Nayyar. Suman Kalyanpur's first film song was a duet with Talat Mahmood in Darwaza (1954). Talat Mahmood heard Kalyanpur singing in a musical concert and was highly impressed by her singing. A rank newcomer, her career hit the big league when Talat agreed to sing the duet with her, making the film industry sit up and take notice of her. She sang for the movie, Mangu (1954), Koi Pukare Dheere Se Tujhe. Kalyanpur provided playback singing for Miyan Bibi Razi (1960), Baat Ek Raat Ki (1962), Dil Ek Mandir (1963), Dil Hi To Hai (1963), Shagoon (1964), Jahan Ara (1964), Sanjh Aur Sawera (1964), Noor Jahan (1967), Saathi (1968) and Pakeezah (1971). She sang for composers Shankar Jaikishan, Roshan, Madan Mohan, S. D. Burman, Hemant Kumar, Chitragupta, Naushad, S. N. Tripathi, Ghulam Mohammed, Kalyanji Anandji and Laxmikant-Pyarelal singing the most songs for the first two in the list. She has sung over 740 movie and non-movie songs. She sang over 140 duets with Rafi in the 1960s. Suman's first song in Marathi was the super-hit \"Bhaatuklichaa khel maandila\" for Vasant Prabhu, for the film Pasant Aahe Mulgi. After that she never looked back for over 20 years. Putra Vhawa Aisaa, Ekti, Manini and Annapoorna were but a few of her memorable films. But even outside films, her hits are legion and include over 50 timeless gems of Marathi films, bhavgeet and bhaktigeet. Kalyanpur sang with Lata Mangeshkar the duet \"Kabhi Aaj, Kabhi Kal, Kabhi Parson\" under the direction of composer Hemant Kumar. She recorded some popular duets with male singers Mohammed Rafi, Manna Dey, Mukesh, Talat Mahmood, and Hemant Kumar. Some of her memorable duets with Rafi are \"Aajkal Tere Mere Pyaar Ke Charche\", \"Na Na Karte Pyaar\", \"Tumse O Hasina\", \"Rahen Na Rahen Hum\", \"Parbaton Ke Pedon Par Shaam Ka Basera He\", \"Yeh Parbaton Ke Daayare\", \"Ajahuna Aye Balama\", \"Tumane Pukara Aur Hum Chale Aye\", \"Bad Muddat Ke Yeh Ghadi Ayee\", \"Mujhhe Yeh Bhool Na\", \"Dil Ne Phir Yaad Kiya\", \"Tujhko Dilbari Ki Kasam\" and \"Chand Takata Hai Idhar\". With Manna Dey, she sang the popular duet \"Na Jane Kahan Ham The\" under the music direction of Dattaram. With Mukesh she has sung many popular duets like `Yeh Kisne geet chheda', \"Akhiyon ka noor hai tu\", \"Mera Pyar bhi tu hai\", \"Dil ne phir yaad Kiya\", \"Shama se koi Kehde\" etc. Kalyanpur also recorded some memorable songs with a classical base, including \"Manamohan Man Mein Ho Tumhi\", \"Mere Sang G\u0101 Gunguna\" and \"Gir Gayi Re More Mathe Ki Bindiya\". Kalyanpur's voice was very similar to the great singer Lata Mangeshkar. Many of her songs are indistinguishable from Lata's style, because she sung with a quality comparable to Lata. Kalyanpur becomes very uncomfortable regarding the similarity between her voice and Lata\u2019s. She had once answered \"I was quite influenced by her. In my college days, I used to sing her songs. Meri aawaaz nazuk aur patli thi (My voice was fragile and thin). What could I do? Also when Radio Ceylon relayed the songs, the names were never announced. Even the records sometimes gave the wrong name. Maybe that caused more confusion.\" In the era of 1950s and 1960s, the period was referred as the golden era of Hindi film music where the time when female playback singing was dominated by the Mangeshkar sisters Lata and Asha Bhosale. When Lata was not available for recording, or if the producers could not afford her rate of Rs 100 per song, the song used to be sung by Kalyanpur. During the similar period, Lata had refused to sing with Rafi over royalty issues and those songs were recorded by Kalyanpur with Rafi. She sang over 140 duets with Rafi in this period. Suman married a Mumbai based businessman Ramanand Kalyanpur in the year 1958 and thus, became Suman Kalyanpur from Suman Hemadi. He accompanied her for every recording session after her marriage. She has a daughter named Charul Agni who is settled in the United States after marriage. Mera Pyar Bhi Tu Hai Yeh Bahar Bhi Tu Hai with Mukesh from Saathi (1968) Her recordings include devotional songs, ghazals and thumris. In Marathi, Kalyanpur recorded for composers Sudhir Phadke, Dashrath Pujari, Kamlakar Bhagwat and Ashok Patki."

Her father, Dushyant Kumar Chauhan, who is from Uttar Pradesh, is a theatre personality at the Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra. Her mother, a homemaker, inclined Chauhan to persuade a career in music. She also has a younger sister. At the age of four, Chauhan started performing at competitions and local gatherings, subsequently convinced by her father's friends to take singing seriously. During that time, she was doing live shows and trained herself with \"regular riyaaz by listening to cassettes and CDs of popular numbers\". She did her studies from Greenfields Public School and used to stay with her family members. She discontinued studies right after schooling to pursue a career in the music industry.

So she sang the song with that slightly broken voice\". In 2001, Chauhan was featured in four tracks from the album of Ajnabee. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com described Chauhan's rendition of Adnan Sami-duet \"Mehbooba Mehbooba\" as \"saucy\", and Kumar Sanu-duet \"Meri Zindagi Mein\" as \"mundane rendition\" but criticized the next two tracks; \"Mujhko Neend Aa Rahi Hai\" and \"Kasam Se Teri Aankhen\" as she is heard \"bored\" and \"fall flat\".

Moreover, Chauhan was selected to record the title track of Piku when composer Anupam Roy tried a lot of \"current\" singers, but the voices did not have the \"spunky element\" Roy wanted. However, Surabhi Redkar from Koimoi felt that Chauhan's \"gifted bright voice\" failed to \"upbeat feel\" of the song.

Lata Mangeshkar who described Chauhan's vocals as \"different\" from her contemporary, mentioned that her voice will not suit musical style of Lori. Chauhan has a \"powerful\" and \"husky\" voice which she attributes to her father. Chauhan feels that her vocals structure suits Priyanka Chopra, Katrina Kaif, Kajol, Parineeti Chopra and Urmila Matondkar the most. Chauhan's \"high-energy vocals\" have been described as \"stereotyped\" in item numbers by the media. However, according to The Daily Star, \"be it a soft classical-like piece or an operatic pitch, Chauhan is spectacular with her vocals\". Though Chauhan has performs in high-pitched vocals songs, she is prominent for her \"deeper pitched voice\" where Ajay Gehlawat wrote: \"Chauhan's deeper timbre replaces Asha Bhosle's higher pitched vocals\" in the song \"Yeh Mera Dil\", ensuring such \"fuller female timbres become more commonplace' to a decidedly more forceful and sensual sounds\". Ganesh Anantharaman in his book Bollywood Melodies: A History of the Hindi Film Song wrote that Chauhan has a \"good, expressive\" voice but she crafted a particular image for herself as the singer of fast, racy songs. The Times of India considered her voice as the \"liveliest voice in Bollywood\". According to MensXP.com, \"her voice is orgasmic and extremely fierce. While singing a certain stanza, she gets into the mood so deeply, her voice breaks into a passionate squeal as she strikes a high note\". In an interview, Indian classical musician Rahul Sharma said, \"Chauhan's voice has an element of sensuality which [is] also very versatile and I admire the quality of her voice and the kind of emotions she can bring out\". Chauhan believes that her voice has \"certain uniqueness\" and when it comes to a particular genre of singing, she cannot be competed. Chauhan's music contains elements of pop, hip hop and R&B. Chauhan's name was mostly tagged with item songs, though she has performed melodious slow numbers. Chauhan believes that her audience feels more comfortable in hearing her singing item songs and she made her \"name because of that genre\". Overtime, she was referred in the media as the \"queen of item songs\". The perception of singing only item songs was \"broken\" when Chauhan performed the romantic song, \"Meri Zindagi Mein\" for Anu Malik which was then followed by songs from Chameli and Fanaa. After several releases, she was described \"stereotyped\" with singing of similar style of item songs and the trend of such songs were criticized. However, Chauhan declared that she \"dislikes\" tagging songs as item numbers and \"they are treated specially, they have extra attention and they are picturised in a special way. So, I like being associated to any special song\". Describing her singing style, Chauhan said; \"I have no particular style; instead I only go with the music and the lyrics, and feel free to express my emotions through singing\". Though Chauhan's singing style has a strong western influences, she has recorded some semi-classical songs in her career, including songs from Rang Rasiya. However, she has not performed any classical songs or a ghazal and expressed her interest on releasing a ghazal album since releasing a film ghazal is almost unknown today as a female song. Known for her high pitch renditions, Chauhan's personal favourites are soft, soothing numbers. Chauhan listens to different kinds of music at \"different times\" but she considered soulful song as her \"all time favorites\". Believing that singing all kinds of songs makes her grow as a musician she revealed that her \"weakness remains for soft melodies\". \"Even on live shows, I first sing my fast numbers to get the audience into the groove. But once they are happy with their favorite numbers, I switch on to slow scores\". Chauhan's live rendition of songs is praised by the viewers for her power and energy. A newspaper published in the United Arab Emirates, The National wrote: \"From flitting between fast and slow songs, to playing with the tempos and notes of the songs she sang, she didn\u2019t stick to the original format of any number\". Chauhan was introduced to music by her father, and credited her \"powerful\" voice to him. Chauhan acknowledged that western music has had a huge impact in her singing and confessed that she likes to perform \"songs that have a western flavour in them\". Believing that her voice has a \"global appeal\", Chauhan feels that her exposure to international music has only \"sharpened\" her skills while she does not forcefully tries to imply a western feel to the song. Chauhan considers Lata Mangeshkar as her biggest inspiration. \"She is not a singer for me but a temple of music. There is something beyond singing that only she has\". Chauhan grew up listening to music by Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle, while she is equally influenced by singers like Kavita Krishnamurthy, Sadhana Sargam, Alka Yagnik, Kishori Amonkar, Kishore Kumar and Manna Dey. Sonu Nigam who helped her getting her first break in the industry was named as one of the biggest influences in shaping her career along with her parents and she described him as a \"catalyst to fuel my career\". Besides, Chauhan mentioned that competition is another influence in working hard in the industry. She was mainly compared with her contemporary singer Shreya Ghoshal for which Chauhan stated, \"I am contented to have my own area in the current music world. Likewise, Shreya Ghoshal has her own. I personally respect Shreya for her talents and nice songs, whom people consider as a threat to me\". Moreover, Chauhan's versatility is compared with Bhosle, where she described Bhosle as a \"singing institution\", whereas, Chauhan is like a \"student to her\". Chauhan has also been influenced by many artists outside the country. Chauhan considered Beyonc\u00e9 as her role model and acknowledged her for keeping \"herself together\" and \"balancing her life perfectly\"; \"She is such a strong woman. She can do everything\". Chauhan also admired the work of Michael Jackson and referred him as her God. \"My first pick [from books] was Michael Jackson's autobiography. He is my God. I read the first two chapters and had tears in my eyes\". Other mainstream country influences includes Mariah Carey, Celine Dion and Whitney Houston. According to Chauhan she started listening English songs after she turned 11, and she grew up listening to \"Always Be My Baby\" by Carey. Apart from them, Chauhan named Alicia Keys and Usher as some of her favorites among foreign artists. Chauhan who admires the work of Shakira was keen to be part of the Indian version of the The Voice since she served as a coach on the American version of the show. Known for experimenting with her style and image, Chauhan's music and fashion sense are noted by the media. In 2010, while she appeared a judge in the Indian Idol (Season 5), her look was discussed in the media; Rediff.com considered her wardrobe sense a \"real shame\" considering that she is \"young\", \"slim\" and \"pretty\". However, Mid Day praised her style in the show for \"dressing in normal clothes\" while compared to other judges, though they mentioned that \"her hairstyle changes too often for our liking\". Prior to Indian Idol, Chauhan's face was not so familiar with the public and according to her, people imagined her to be a \"30 to 40 years old woman in a sari\", while she is \"dressed casually in denims and a tee\". Reportedly, during a concert in Kolkata, the local people did not recognize her when she entered the venue, until the host introduced her to them. After Chauhan got married in 2012, she had put on weight of about 20kg. During the time, she was getting breathless on stage, hence she wanted to get fit. As Chauhan has to perform at concerts and regular shows, she wanted to \"feel light and confident\".

She made sure she works out at the gym every day or goes for a jog; follows a healthy diet; eats on time and sleeps as much as she can. She knocked off 12kg by jogging and working out. Post a hairdo in 2014, she worked on her wardrobe and chose a trendy image to \"open up\" to the fashion.

She was the most popular singing star of the Indian sub-continent of her generation. Till 1943, as a child singer, Suraiya gave play-back for one actress, namely, Mehtab in three films and also in some of her own films for her roles as a child artiste. After this, she only sang for her own films as an actress, and as a heroine after 1946 till 1963. From 1948 to 1950, she became the singing superstar of Bollywood, earning the highest amount for her performances, over all the performing actors of the times, male or female, including Dev Anand, Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Nargis and Madhubala. She was the only child of her parents. She had a natural talent for singing, acting and dancing from childhood. She received basic training in music, when her mother used to take her to Hindustani music teacher or 'masterji' for training. She first sang for a children's program for All India Radio in 1937.

She was also known for her North Indian Muslim feudal style acting or 'adakari' in many of her films (Mirza Ghalib (film), Phool, Afsar, Shayar, Jeet (1949 film), Anmol Ghadi, Dastan). This style 'endowed modernity with an aura of tradition' and brought nostalgic feudal tinge to the scenes. Her performance 'expertly integrated gestures, music and speech'. Suraiya in her heydays was known as 'Malika-e-Husn' (queen of beauty), 'Malika-e-Tarannum' (queen of melody) and 'Malika-e-Adakaari' (queen of acting), all rolled into one.

Soon, her father moved to Lahore and Suraiya was taken by her mother, Mumtaz Begum, and maternal grandmother, Badshah Begum to Bombay in early nineteen thirties, when she was one year old. Her maternal uncle, named Zahoor (also known as M. Zahoor) also came to Bombay and became a well known villain in films. Suraiya's father, later came to live with her and he died on the day of 'Holi' in March 1963. She attended New High School, now known as, J.B. Petit High School for Girls in Fort, Mumbai. Later, 1942 onwards, when she started singing for films as a 12 year old, her school principal Miss P.F. Patuck told her father not to let her be absent from school during school days. She sang for Mehtab in three films in 1942\u201343 and also acted and sang in a few films as a child artiste. In her childhood, Raju Bharatan, a few years younger to her who later became a famous music and sports writer, critic and correspondent, actor Raj Kapoor and composer Madan Mohan, both a few years older, were her neighbourhood friends. Raj Kapoor and Madan Mohan, both used to sing with her in A.I.R.(All India Radio), when she was a six-year-old girl. In fact, Madan Mohan first introduced her to A.I.R.(All India Radio) as a child singer. Later in life, Raju Bharatan wrote extensively about Suraiya in his books, while Raj Kapoor was her hero in one of her films, Dastan (1950), and Madan Mohan composed music for her film, Khubsoorat (1952). Suraiya made her debut as a child artist in 'Madam Fashion' in 1936, as Miss Suraiya, along with Nargis as Baby Rani. The film was directed by Jaddan Bai, mother of Nargis, with Jaddan Bai herself as heroine, and music and songs, also written and sung by her. Later, she got a prominent role as a child artiste with the help of her uncle M. Zahoor, who was then a popular villain in films. During a holiday from school in 1941, she accompanied him to Bombay's Mohan Studios to see the shooting of the film Taj Mahal (1941 film), which was being directed by Nanubhai Vakil. Vakil noticing the charm and innocence of young Suraiya, selected her to play the role of young Mumtaj Mahal. While she was singing for children's programs for All India Radio, Mumbai, as a six year old, Raj Kapoor and Madan Mohan who were her playmates in her neighbourhood and were 5\u20136 years older to her, used to be her co-artists. In fact, they first introduced her to AIR. Raj Kapoor, later, attained fame as an actor and a film maker, while Madan Mohan became well-known music director. Both were associated with her, later as an adult, as her hero and as her music director respectively in films. In AIR, Zulfiqar Ali Bukhari was then the Station Director at the Bombay Radio Station. Once, music director Naushad Ali heard Suraiya's voice, he chose her to sing as a 13-year-old for Mehtab in Abdul Rashid Kardar's film Sharda (1942). He became Suraiya's mentor and she sang some of the best songs of her career under his baton. Later he gave hits after hits when Suraiya became full-fledged singing star in Anmol Ghadi (1946), Dard (1947), Dillagi (1949) and Dastaan (1950). Naushad Ali composed approximately 51 songs for Suraiya, coming at 2nd place after Husnlal Bhagatram for composing the highest number of songs for Suraiya. As a child artist, she acted and also sang in Tamanna (1942), Station Master (1942), and Hamari Baat(1943). As an adult, Suraiya initially played as a co-star with the heroine in K. Asif's Phool, Mehboob Khan's Anmol Ghadi (1946), (which was written by Aghajani Kashmeri also known as Kashmiri) and Dard (1947). She acted as a heroine in the film Tadbir (1945) on the recommendation of K. L. Saigal, who liked her voice during a rehearsal of a song for Jayant Desai's film 'Samrat Chandragupt' (1945) in which she was acting. He recommended her name to Desai opposite himself in 'Tadbir' (1945). She went on to co-star with K. L. Saigal in Omar Khayyam (1946) and Parwana (1947 film). Although by then she had a couple of hit songs, but the four solo songs which she sang in Parwana for music director Khwaja Khurshid Anwar made her a genuine singer-film star. She had high regards for Khwaja Khurshid Anwar for whom she sang thirteen songs during 1943 to 1949 period. More opportunities arose for Suraiya after reigning famous actress Noor Jehan and Khursheed Bano migrated to Pakistan following the Partition of India in 1947. As an actress, Suraiya had an edge over her contemporaries Kamini Kaushal and Nargis, because she could sing her own songs. After three hits Pyar Ki Jeet (1948), Bari Bahen (1949), and Dillagi (1949), she became the highest paid film star, earning 1-2\u00a0lakhs of rupees per film, when male actors got much less. When 'Pyar Ki Jeet' was released, it drew large crowds outside Suraiya's house that had to be controlled by posting an inspector and four constables outside her house. During the premiere of 'Badi Behan', there was a very large crowd outside the cinema hall and the police had to lathi-charge when Suraiya was walking into the hall. People even pulled at her clothes, so that after that, Suraiya stopped going to the premieres of her films. But her reign at the very top was till 1952, after which, she reduced her assignments. She made a comeback in Waaris and Mirza Ghalib (film) (1954). Rustom Sohrab (1963) was the last film of her career. In the late 1940s, she worked with Dev Anand. While shooting the film Vidya (1948), she became romantically involved with Dev Anand. The two of them were paired in seven films together: Vidya (1948), Jeet (1949), Shair (1949), Afsar (1950), Nili (1950), Do Sitare (1951) and Sanam (1951), all of which were successful at the box office. In these films, Suraiya was always first-biller in the credits, indicating that she was a bigger star than Dev Anand. She fell in love with him during the shooting of the song Kinare Kinare Chale Jaayenge from the film 'Vidya' in 1948. While shooting the scene in a river, the boat they were in capsized, and Dev Anand saved Suraiya from drowning. From 1948 to 1951, their love affair was the talk of the tinsel world. During the shooting of the film 'Jeet', Dev Anand proposed to her and gave her a diamond ring worth rupees three thousand, a huge sum in those days. Suraiya was glad to be proposed, but soon her grandmother found out about her engagement and threw her ring into the sea. Her maternal grandmother opposed the relationship, mainly because they were Muslims and Dev Anand was a Hindu. Suraiya and Dev Anand were stopped from acting together after her last film with Dev Anand in 1951 by her grandmother. Thereafter, Suraiya remained unmarried by her own choice for the rest of her life. From the late forties to the early fifties, she remained the highest paid, as well as, the most popular star of the Indian cinema Her reign at the top was from 1947 to 1952.Her contract with A. R. Kardar ended with Deewana, after which she reduced her assignments in films. She made national news with Sohrab Modi's film Mirza Ghalib (1954), which won a national award, the President's Gold medal for the Best Feature Film. In the film, she made vivid, the role of the married Ghalib's lover. Along with an emotionally fluid performance where her expressions of love, expectation and hurt just seemed to merge into one another, the queen of cadence also recorded songs, which are still regarded by many as the definitive Ghalib renditions and the standard by which Ghalib's gazal singing is measured. No less a personality than Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru praised her singing and acting by saying, Tumne Mirza Ghalib Ki Rooh Ko Zinda Kar Diya, (You have brought Mirza Ghalib to life). After Mirza Ghalib, she acted in movies like Bilwamangal (1954), Waris (1954), Shama Parwana (1954), Kanchan (1955) (which was released in 1949 as Amar Kahani and re-released as 'Kanchan'), Inam (1955), Mr. Lambu (1956), Trolly Driver (1958), Miss 1958 (1958), Maalik (1958) and Shama (1961). In mid-fifties, Suraiya told Lata once that she would soon be cutting down on her films. Lata told her not to do so. Rustom Sohrab (1963) was her last film. The song, 'Yeh kaisi ajab daastan ho gayi hai' from the film, which was one of her finest songs, was also her last, as with this song Suraiya also said 'adieu' to her singing career, along with her film career. Suraiya in an interview said that during the shooting of the film, she suffered from low blood pressure, which was the reason of her giving up her acting career. As a heroine, Suraiya acted with the following actors as heroes in her films, namely, Prithviraj Kapoor, Raj Kapoor, Shammi Kapoor, Dev Anand, K. L. Sehgal, Ashok Kumar, Ajit, Kamal Kapoor, Rehman, Surendra, Shyam (Chopra), Amar Nath, Karan Dewan, Jairaj, Mukesh, C. H. Atma, Talat Mehmood, Sheikh Mukhtar, Naseer Khan (Dileep Kumar's brother), Vijay Dutt (Guru Dutt's brother), Prem Nath, Bharat Bhushan, Suresh, Wasti, Moti Lal, Jayant, Nusrat. Her film 'Jaanwar' in early nineteen fifties with Dilip Kumar as hero (and K. Asif as director) was left incomplete by her, as she refused to act in the film, because of rough behaviour by Dilip Kumar during the shooting of the film. In 1953, she refused film 'Anarkali' as heroine, a role which went to Bina Rai. Suraiya had a very sweet voice from childhood. She could sing all types of songs with ease, whether sad, with pathos in her voice, or romantic with amorous love, or comic with playful jest. Suraiya was initially, not a classically trained singer in Hindustani music, knowing the 'grammar' or theory of Hindustani music, yet she was a practical singer by nature. She became the most outstanding singing star of her times from 1945 to 1963 and reached dizzying heights during 1947\u20131950 in her popularity as an actress. Suraiya's first song as a child-singer was \"Boot karun main polish babu\" (as a playback singer) in the film Nai Duniya (1942), composed by Naushad. She went on to sing playback for Mehtab for Sharda, Kanoon and Sanjog (1942\u201343) under him, when her principal, Miss P.F. Puttack, took a strong view of her truancy from school, and her \u2018adventure\u2019 came to an abrupt halt. As a singer, Suraiya sang as a playback singer for actress Mehtab in Sharda (1942), Kanoon (1943) and Sanjog (1943), with Naushad as the music director and A R Kardar as director and producer. At first, seeing baby Suraiya, Mehtab was hesitant to have her as her playback singer, but on hearing her, she wanted Suraiya to sing all her songs in her films. Even in later years, in 1946, Mehtab was so attached to Suraiya's singing, that she requested Suraiya to record disc versions of her songs in her film Shama (1946), produced by Sohrab Modi, when Suraiya had become a busy heroine and had left singing playback in films for Mehtab. Suraiya then sang for Mehtab, in her own disc versions, available in YouTube, which were recorded by Shamshad Begum in the film. Suraiya debuted with Manna Dey in his first Hindi film song and their only duet 'Jago ayee usha' in 'Tamanna' in 1942, for which his uncle, famous K. C. Dey was the music director. Again in 1942, Suraiya paired with Rajkumari in 'Station-Master' for the song 'sajan ghar aye'. A few years later, the great singer actor, K.L. Saigal was so impressed by the singing of 16 years old youthful Suraiya, that he readily agreed to have her opposite him in the film 'Tadbir' as a heroine and a singer in 1945. Saigal again opted for Suraiya as his heroine and a singer in films 'Omar Khayyam' (1946) and 'Parwana' (1947). 'Parwana' was Saigal's last film and was released after his death. Later, Suraiya continued to work with music director Naushad in a few films and in 1946, she appeared with actress Noor Jehan in Anmol Ghadi as a co-star and Naushad as the music director. She sang three songs in the film, which became popular, of which 'Man Leta Hai Angdai' went viral throughout the country. Musical film 'Dillagi' (1949), under Kardar's direction, with Naushad's music, became a silver jubilee hit, with Suraiya becoming a national rage with her songs and acting. In a span of 22 years, she gave a number of hits. In her honey-rich voice, songs like \"Woh paas rahain, ya door rahein\", 'Tere naino ne chori kiya', 'Tu mera chaand, main teri chandni', \"Yaad karun tori batiya\" and the rare classical number, 'Man mor hua matwala' created hysteria in the country. Khurshid Anwar was the music director in Suraiya's three films, viz. 'Ishara (1943)', 'Parwana (1947)' and 'Singar (1949)'. Suraiya sang 13 songs in these films. Some outstanding songs of 'Parwana' are \"Jab tumhi nahin apne\", \"Mere munderey na bol\", and \"Papi papiha re\". With music directors duo, Husnlal Bhagatram, Suraiya worked in 11 films and recorded the highest number of songs for any music director from 1948 to 1958. The films were Pyar Ji Jeet (1948), Aaj Ki Raat (1948), Naach (1949), Balam (1949), Bari Behen(1949), Amar Kahani(1949), Sanam (1951), Shama Parwana(1954), Kanchan (1955), Trolley Driver (1955). Her song 'O, door janewale, wada na bhul jana' in 'Pyar Ki Jeet' in 1948 became a hit all over India. Suraiya did only three films with music composer Sachin Dev Burman, viz. Vidya(1948) (with Dev Anand), Afsar (1949) (with Dev Anand) and Lal Kunwar (1952)), as she was associated with other composers and SD Burman came late into the scene in Bombay. Yet, most of their songs are memorable. 'Man mor hua Matwala' (Afsar), 'Nain Dewane' (Afsar), 'Layi khushi ki dunia' (with Mukesh in 'Vidya') and 'Preet sataye teri yaad na'(Lal Kunwar) being some of them. All of Suraiya's songs from her film 'Mirza Ghalib' (1954) (music director: Ghulam Mohammed) have become classical songs and have enhanced the beauty of Ghalib's ghazals for the connoisseur and the layman alike. The songs 'Yeh na thi hamari kismat', 'Nukta- cheen hai gam-e-dil', 'Dil-e-nadan tujhe hua kya hai', 'Aah Ko Chahiye', 'Rahiye ab aisi jagha' are the finest examples of ghazal singing. Another movie of Suraiya, which has evergreen songs, is 'Shama' (1961). The lyrics were written by the stalwart lyricist Kaifi Azmi and the music composer was another 'Great', Ghulam Mohammed. The memorable songs sung by Suraiya are 'Mast aankhon mein shararat', 'Dhadakte Dil Ki Tamanna ho','Aap se pyaar hua jata hai'. Suraiya was the only singing actress, who also worked as a heroine and co-star with many other singing-stars of her times, including Noor Jehan (Anmol Ghadi), C. H. Atma (Bilwamangal), Talat Mahmood (Maalik and Waris), Mukesh (Mashuqa), K.L. Saigal (Tadbeer, Omar Khaiyyam and Parwana) and Surendra (1857 and Anmol Ghadi). Her last film as a singing actress was Rustom Sohrab, with the song \"Yeh kaisi ajab dastan ho gayi hai\", being her last, yet one of the most remembered songs. Suraiya was recognized as the first Melody Queen of the sub - continent and was the first singer to be given the honorific \"Malika-e-Tarannum\" (Melody Queen) for her singing talent before partition, ahead of any other singer. Suraiya could sing in all octaves, though she mostly sang her songs in lower octaves, as many of them were 'ghazals' and 'geets'. An example of her higher octave song is from the film 'Tadbir' (1945), viz. 'Jaag Ae Sonewale', with music by Lal Mohammad, who composed music in just four films, but was masterly in each one of them. Suraiya's songs, as a tribute to her, are played every year on her death anniversary on 31 January by Radio Sri Lanka (Hindi music) and are recorded on YouTube by eraksoldies. In the late 1940s and early 50s, craze for Suraiya amongst her fans was at its peak. Her house at Marine Drive was always mobbed by her fans and suitors, when her car used to come out or enter the gates. Most of the fans were obsessed with her. \"She was a screen goddess and a mellifluous singer, who had the world at her feet.\"(Tribune). Even one of them (actress Veena's brother) went on a fast outside her house, so that she would acquisce and marry him. Another crazy fan came with a 'barat'(wedding party) and dowry from Lahore, and yet another, kept a photograph of hers in the 'Puja' (temple at home) and would not eat without worshipping her. Even street singers would make money singing songs fom her film 'Pyar ki Jeet'. At the other extreme, even Kanti Desai, son of the Chief Minister, Bombay State, Morarji Desai (later Prime Minister of India), invited her to a private party, but she refused politely. It is said that Kanti Desai tried hard, even threatening her, but to no consequence. Actor Dharmendra was a great fan of Suraiya. He is said to have seen her film 'Dillagi' (1949) forty times in his teens, walking miles from his hometown, Sahnewal in Punjab, to watch her movies. Suraiya was known for her glamour, dresses and jewellery in films like ' Mirza Ghalib', 'Pyar Ki Jeet', 'Dillagi', 'Sanam', 'Dastan', 'Diwana' and 'Shama Parwana', while many of her films had simple, non-glamourous roles. In real life, Suraiya was known for her love for ethnic dresses and jewellery. At functions, she wore her jewellery to her maximum advantage and wore make-up. She kept her image of actress Suraiya alive in her viewers mind till her later life.  Journalist Suresh Kohli reported in 'Deccan Herald' in 2011, that during the 1977 Filmfare Awards function, hush descended on the scene, when heavily be-jewelled Suraiya, dressed in green brocade saree and sporting a 'bindi' and escorted by Filmfare editor B.K.Karanjia, walked towards Dev Anand, her favourite hero, former lover, marriage proposer and friend, whom she could not marry, under pressure. Suraiya was an ardent fan of the Hollywood star Gregory Peck, who paid her a surprise visit with actor, Al Nasir at mid-night from Hotel Ambassador near her home on January 5, 1954. Gregory Peck had come to Bombay for delivering the first Filmfare Awards, but was late because of flight delay from Ceylon. In 1952, Suraiya had given Frank Capra, a signed photograph of hers to be delivered to her idol, Gregory Peck, when Capra came to India for 20 days to attend the International Film Festival. Gregory Peck told Suraiya that \"he found my photograph which I sent him through Mr. Capra so beautiful that he had it on the wall of his bedroom! He did, and he actually asked me to act with him in a picture.\" In the late 1940s, Dev Anand used to enact Gregory Peck's mannerisms to please Suraiya, as she was a fan of Gregory Peck and she often expressed this to Dev Anand. Their love-affair continued for four years from 1948 to 1951. Dev Anand nick-named Suraiya \"Nosey\", while to Suraiya Dev Anand was \"Steve\", a name chosen from a book Dev Anand had given her. Suraiya also called Dev Anand \"Devina\" and Dev Anand called Suraiya \"Suraiyana\", while faking Italian accent. (Later on Dev Anand named his daughter 'Devina' as told to Suraiya, 'Star & Style', February, 1987). Suraiya was so much in love with Dev Anand that she let Lata sing some of the songs picturized on her in her films, in order to get more time to be with Dev Anand. Her love for Dev Anand was so intense, that she was ready to forgo her singing star career for Dev, who was even more passionate about her. \"All I could then think of was my love for Dev - Suraiya as a singing star and her career be damned!\"(in 'A Journey Down Memory Lane' by Raju Bharatan). During the shooting of director Rana Pratap's film 'Jeet', both Dev Anand and Suraiya, with the help of the film members, namely Durga Khote (actress), Dwarka Divecha (cinematographer) and others, had made plans for marriage in a temple, and elopement, but at the last minute, an assistant director, jealous of their marriage, informed Suraiya's grandmother, who dragged her home from the scene. Speaking to journalist Sheila Vesuna, Suraiya said, \"Eventually, my grandmother succeeded in separating us. Dev was deeply hurt and offended by my lack of courage. But I was afraid for him. In retrospect, I don't think anything would have happened if I'd been bold enough. But I was terrified of my grandmother. And was heartbroken. But time is the greatest healer.\" Suraiya's grandmother, Badshah Begum, who controlled the family, was fiercely opposed to Suraiya marrying Dev Anand. She was also supported by Suraiya's maternal uncle, Zahoor and some film persons, viz. composer Naushad, director-producer AR Kardar, lyricist Naqshab (Nadira's first husband) and director M. Sadiq. During the shooting of Dev Anand's own production 'Afsar' (1950), under the banner of 'Navketan', Suraiya's grandmother started to oppose their romance openly and started interfering even in the shooting of their love scenes. Kamini Kaushal, who worked with Suraiya and Dev Anand in 'Shair' (1949), said in an interview to Filmfare in January 2014, that Suraiya would pass on her letters to her be delivered to Dev Anand, when her grandmother started keeping an eye on their love-affair. She said that Dev Anand was non-aggressive, not someone to put his foot down and say, \"I'll marry her\". Dev Anand in a TV interview with Simi, \"Rendezvous with Simi Garewal\", after Suraiya's death in January 2004, revealed that Suraiya, who had gladly accepted his ring first, never told him the reason for her later refusal of the marriage proposal, and that she was coerced to say \"no\" to him by her grandmother. In an interview with 'Stardust', June 1972, Suraiya revealed that she lacked courage to resist her family and that Dev Anand truly loved her. \"When I refused to marry Dev Anand, he called me a coward. Maybe I was one. I admit I didn't have the courage to take a step I was not absolutely sure of. Perhaps, it was a folly, perhaps a mistake, or perhaps destiny\". Dev Anand in the interview with Simi, said that after she had said \"no\" to him, much later, she probably regretted it. But, by then, he had gone much ahead. The principal reason of opposition by the grandmother and her advisers was that Dev Anand was of a different religion and the covert one was that Suraiya was the only earning member of the family. Naqshab, even brought a copy of Koran to make her swear that she would not marry Dev Anand (February 1987, 'Star and Style' interview of both Dev Anand and Suraiya by Sheila Vesuna). The film people had also their own professional and personal interests in opposing an early marriage of their popular singing star. Rather, M. Sadiq, who was a married man, himself wanted to marry her. Suraiya's parents wanted her to marry Dev Anand, but being a mellow couple, their voice was ignored by the grandmother. In the 'Star and Style' interview, Suraiya said that she gave in only when both her grandmother and her maternal uncle threatened to get Dev Anand killed. Suraiya told during this interview, that during the shooting of the film 'Neeli', when she told Dev Anand that she did not want her to be the cause of his death, he slapped her across the face and called her a \"coward\". She did not mind Dev Anand slapping her, because she knew how much he loved her. Dev Anand later kept on apologising for days about his behaviour. The painful dalliance with Dev Anand, left her bruised emotionally, a phase from which many said she never recovered. A retreat from the public atmosphere was followed by a return in films like Mirza Ghalib (1954) for which she received praise even from the Prime Minister, Jawahar Lal Nehru, but she never attained the dizzy public popularity she had attained earlier on. Suraiya refused to marry anyone in future, in spite of efforts by her family to persuade her to marry certain film directors and businessmen of their community. M. Sadiq, film director, actor Rehman were some of the film persons who were interested in marrying Suraiya. Dev Anand who was very depressed on her reluctant refusal to marry him, and was counselled by his brother Chetan Anand to recover and stand up from the break up, went on to marry Kalpana Kartik after four years in 1954 in a hurried simple marriage, but as he said in his auto-biography, Suraiya was his first true love. Elsewhere, he has said to Shekhar Hattangadi that in spite of his marriage to Kalpana Kartik after his failed love affair that \"Suraiya was the love and passion of his life and that I will always cherish her memory\". While Suraiya was alive in October 2003, Dev Anand accepted the fact that \"Suraiya was my first and only real love. I wanted to marry her and she was willing. But her Muslim family objected to my being a Hindu, and created a big row over the communal issue. Remember, she was already a big singing star when we first met, and I was a nobody. Fans mobbed her, her songs were on the air, and her star image added to the attraction.\" In an interview to A Ganesh Nadar of rediff.com, reminiscing about Suraiya in his autobiography, Dev Anand said, \"The book would not be honest without mentioning her. Parting with her was painful. I met her for the last time on the terrace of her building in Marine Drive (in south Mumbai). That was the saddest day of my life.\" Suraiya and Dev Anand later did meet on a few occasions in parties as friends in Mumbai in their lifetime. Suraiya gave up her professional career as an actress and singer in 1963, and even later on refused to sing for music directors, like Naushad and for music companies like HMV and Polydor, despite several requests by them. She went on to live life away from media glare and public eye thereafter, except appearing on a very few public occasions, like during Noor Jehans visit to India in 1982. She did give a few interviews for magazines and some media people from India and Pakistan in the 1970s and 80s. Only later in life in the 1990s and thereafter, she accepted awards and mementos and appeared on a few public occasions. Suraiya's maternal grandmother, Badshah Begum, who played a major part in her career and even personal life, later went to Pakistan to live with her brother, and she was left alone with her mother, Mumtaz Begum. The time with her mother were her happy years, when her mother took care of her daily needs and she would occasionally go to her film world friends. She had a few friends like old timer Jairaj, Nimmi, Nirupa Roy and Tabassum, whom she met once in while. After her mother's death in 1987, Suraiya started feeling lonely in her rented apartment (owned by Aswin Shah) in Krishna Mahal, Marine Drive in Mumbai, where she lived from the early 1940s until her death in 2004 at the age of 74. She possessed several apartments in Worli and a house and orchard in Lonavala. Suraiya met Asha Bhonsle on 10 December 1993 at Raju Bharatan daughter Shilpa's wedding reception at Bombay's Vile Parle, where Raju Bharatan asked Suraiya in a chat along with Asha, whether the two had sung a song together, to which Suraiya said, \"regrettably no\", forgetting that the two had sung a duet together in 1954 in 'Shama Parwana', titled 'jake lage naina, wo paiye nahi chaina'. Tabassum, who worked with Suraiya in 'Bari Behan' and 'Moti Mahal' as her younger sister, met her often at her home, or rang Suraiya from her home. During Suraiya's last few months of her life, Tabassum said \"It's sad that she had shut her doors to the world in her last days. Sometimes when I visited her, I\u2019d find papers and milk collected at her door. She never opened the door. But she\u2019d talk comfortably with me on the phone. I remember our last conversation. I asked her, \"Aapa kaisi hain?\"(Elder sister, how are you?\") She replied in verse, \"Kaisi guzar rahi hai sabhi poochte hai mujhse, kaise guzaarti hoon koi nahin poochta.\"( \"Everbody asks me, how are you, but nobody asks me, how I spend my days and nights\".)(As told to Farhana Farook in 2012)\" She died on 31 January 2004 aged 74, after being hospitalized for a few days. In her last six months, she was taken care of by her neighbour and family friends, Dhimant Thakar's family, with whom she stayed during this period. She was very close to the two daughters (Amee and Camy) of Dhimant Thakar. She was admitted for a brief period for hypoglacemia, ischemia and insulinoma to Harkshandas hospital in South Mumbai by Thakars'. In the hospital, actor Sunil Dutt, music director, Naushad and Pratap A. Rana, writer-producer of her films, \"Jeet\" and \"Vidya\", visited her during this period. She died at 9.25\u00a0am on 31 January 2004. Actor Dharmendra, who was her ardent fan, also attended her funeral. She was buried at Badakabarastan in Marine Lines, Mumbai. After her death, Suraiya's property at Worli and her house at Krishna Mahal, where she lived on rent for over 70 years at Marine Drive, went into legal dispute, as she did not leave behind an explicit will. While the house at Krishna Mahal was claimed by her her adopted family (and lawyer) and her cousin, Mehfooz Ahmed (maternal uncle M. Zahoor's son) in Dubai, her property was claimed by the adopted family of her lawyer (based on his daughter being a nominee in Suraiya's papers and gift to her as 'hiba'), and her cousin. In 2006, Mumbai High Court, granted Mehfooz Ahmed, born in Lahore in 1943 and staying in Dubai, the right to administer Suraiya's estate, as she died without a will. In 2008, her cousin who never met her for over 40 years before her death, got the right to the rented house at Krishna Mahal, valued at 7.5 crores rupees, as a tenant by the High Court judgement (according to Mumbai's old rent control laws) over her family lawyer. The house owner Ashwin Shah did not contest the case. The cousin had no objection to the house being sold. In 1948, Suraiya was awarded a gold medal by the noted theatre personality, Adi Pherozeshah Marzban, for her role in Kajal(film), in which she acted as a sixteen year old to a sixty-year-old woman. In the 4 April 1952 issue of the newly launched film magazine 'Filmfare', Suraiya's coloured photograph appeared on the front-cover of the during the first year, second month of its publication, the first issue of which came out in March 1952. Suraiya featured regularly in 'Lux' soap campaigns in magazines and 'Lux' calendars in the 1950s. In 1955, Mirza Ghalib (film), a film in which Suraiya acted, was awarded the President's Gold Medal for the Best Feature Film of 1954 (first Hindi film) during the 2nd National Film Awards and her acting and singing was highly appreciated and extolled by the then Prime Minister, Jawahar Lal Nehru at Rastrapati Bhawan, during the special screening of the movie, which Suraiya said was bigger than an Oscar. In 1994, a retrospective of Suraiya's films was held at Mumbai by the 'Cine Club' during 21\u201326 March 1994, which was inaugurated by the then Cabinet Minister of Maharashtra, Vilas Rao Deshmukh (later Chief Minister of Maharashtra), in Suraiya's presence, wherein she gave an introductory talk about her films and the prevailing trends in Bollywood films. This event is recorded in YouTube as 'Suraiya-Khusboo ka Safar' in four parts. In 1996, Suraiya was awarded the Screen Lifetime Achievement Award, presented to her by the actor-politician Sunil Dutt. Dressed in a splendid white salwar kameez, Suraiya was overwhelmed with emotion on the occasion, and said in her ever sweet voice that she had had a long association with the film industry. She was deeply moved to note that the people continued to remember her after so many years. When the anchor-actor, Javed Jafri asked her to sing a few lines of any of her songs, she refused. Indian Express reported, \"As a star, she still remembers the meaning of letting a legend live. Heroines are captured forever on the silver screen and the public memory must never be updated.\" In December, 1998, she was especially honoured for perpetuating Mirza Ghalib's memory by her acting and songs by the then Prime Minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee during Mirza Ghalib celebrations in New Delhi conducted by the Urdu Academy and Sahitya Academy. In 1999, she was honoured with the Bimal Roy Memorial Trophy, instituted by the Bimal Roy Memorial and Film Society, Mumbai. In 1999, Suraiya was specially invited as the Chief Guest to present the Zee Cine Lifetime Acievement Award to Lata Mangeshkar, the event being conducted by Amin Sayani. On April 30, 2003, Suraiya, \"the unforgettable diva of yesteryears\", as described by the Times of India, was honoured by the Dadasaheb Phalke Academy and Screen World Publication at a special function on the 134th birth anniversary of Dada Phalke, the occasion was chaired by the Cultural Minister of Maharashtra, Ashok Chavan. The Times of India reported, \"Dressed in crimson red zardosi churidar with sparkling long dangling earrings, the singing rage of the 40's, Suraiya received a standing ovation as she went on the dais to receive a small token of appreciation from the Dadasaheb Phalke Academy and Screen World Publication, organisers of the show\". On 3 May 2013, a postage stamp, bearing her image in various roles, was released by the India Post owned by the Government of India to honour her on the occasion of the '100 Years of Indian Cinema'. In 2013, in a poll conducted by the ethnic Indian brand Seven East, in association with the International Indian Film Academy, as part of the 100 years of Indian Cinema, Suraiya was voted as the \"Best On Screen Beauty with the Most Ethnic Look\", followed by film Indian actresses Mumtaz, Waheeda Rehman, Madhubala, Meena Kumari, Sharmila Tagore and Hema Malini. Amin Sayani, renowned radio and TV anchor and music historian selected Suraiya song 'Wo pas rahe ya door rahe' from film 'Badi Behan', as one of the top songs among the 12 songs during the period 1949-1953. In 1954, Suraiya's duet 'Rahi Matwale' from the film 'Waris' with Talat Mehmood was selcted the 5th top songs of the year, chosen by listeners in 'Binaca Geet Mala' on Radio Ceylon. A building in which Suraiya owned flats in Worli, Mumbai is named 'Suraiya Apartments' and a road in Nagargaon, Lonavala, District Pune, where she had some property is named 'Suraiya Road' after her. Even now, in India, jewellery is sold by Suraiya's name by many online companies, because of styles popularized by her in her films and by her adornments, like 'Suraiya' earrings. Speaking about Suraiya, Dev Anand said in an interview, \"Suraiya and I fell in love when we started working together. She was a very nice girl who radiated warmth and friendliness. She was an established star but had no airs about her. I was passionately in love with her. I was young, It was my first love and very intense.\"  Suraiya continued to be so mesmerized by Dev Anand's memories and her love for him, that in a much later interview with Raju Bharatan, she always kept referring to him as \"my Dev', when talking about Dev Anand and her aborted love-affair (aborted by her granny, AR Kardar (producer-director) and Naushad (music-director)). \"I should have stood up to my granny, then and there. Gone ahead and wed my Dev. But, I was too much under Granny's thumb and the moment was gone. What hurt like hell was their \"Woh Hindu hai\" (\"He is a Hindu\") line on which they based their opposition. I owe so much to Kardar and Naushad (for her professional life), but I will never forgive them for the one-track outlook they adopted in creating hurdle after hurdle for me in the purely personal matter of my marrying my Dev\".\" Suraiya had a calm temperament and never showed any bitterness or rancour that is often found in people who have tasted the fruits of success and have to move on. On the contrary, there was a sense of relief from having escaped from the applause, bright lights and camera.(Interview to 'Society Magazine' in January,1982.)  Suraiya never boasted of her singing and acting ability, in spite of her immense popularity in her times. About her singing, she remarked to Raju Bharatan in his book 'Lata Mangeshkar- a Biography', \"Noorjehan was born great, Lata achieved greatness, I had singing greatness thrust upon me\". The centre of attraction of Suraiya's beauty were her large expressive eyes, which were so magnetic that songs were written about her eyes. A song which was sung by her in 'Pyar ki jeet' (1948) on the eyes, 'tere naino ne chori kiya', where her eyes were shown to advantage on screen, catapulted her to be the reigning superstar of her times, fetching her rupees one and a half lakh per film, the highest in those times, when heroes were getting less than one lakh rupees. Suraiya was friendly with elderly journalist, B.K. Karanjia, editor of Filmfare and Screen. She stood by him when a section of the movie industry did not support his hosting 'Constellation Nite', for a charitable cause (scarcity in the State) for a technical reason. The event was held on 10 May 1953 at the Lloyd's Reclamation Grounds at Marine Drive. When she went on stage to sing a song from the film 'Pagalkhana' with Vasant Desai wielding the baton, Dilip Kumar was so moved at the end, that he went on stage to garland her on the stage, which brought the whole house down.( 'Counting my Blessings' by B.K. Karanjia.) During her 28 years long career, Suraiya worked with several actors and actresses. During her interviews, she described the qualities of her co-stars in great detail. She worked with Prithviraj Kapoor in 'Ishara' in 1943, when she was only thirteen and Prithviraj Kapoor was in his mid forties. He encouraged her as his heroine, in spite of the age difference. She said that she respected him very much and the respect increased with years. Suraiya described Raj Kapoor as a \"bombshell\" on the sets and predicted in 1952 that he would make a great producer-director in future, as he was very imaginative. Suraiya worked with K.L. Saigal in three films during 1945 and 1946, when she was 15\u201316 years old. To her working with Saigal was a great honour and a privilege, as he was the king of romance and singing at that time. She was the heroine of actor Shyam and worked with him in three films, viz 'Dillagi', 'Nach' and 'Char Din', before he died suddenly of a fall from a horse on the sets in 1951. She said that she often thought of him as the Errol Flynn of India, as he was a merry person, jocular and talkative. Suraiya confided that Shyam was quite close to her family and even often teased her granny. Ashok Kumar with whom Suraiya worked in one film, 'Khiladi' (1950), was very humorous on the sets, although he appeared to be a serious person. To her, Ashok Kumar matured much as a polished actor after 'Mahal' (1949). Ajit, her hero in 'Moti Mahal' appeared to be a shy person to her at first, although to his fans, he was a \"tough\" guy. He did not mind people saying anything about him. He was nicknamed \"John Hal\" on the sets. Her hero of several films Rehman was a \"thinking actor\", who often played chess with her, a game she did not like much. He was generally serious, but could be witty at times with his jokes, which he wanted others to listen to. Jairaj, actor and hero in many of her films, had been known to her since her childhood. She knew him as a very generous and straightforward person, who was taken advantage of by many persons. He too was often a guest at her home on Sundays for lunch. Nasir Khan, younger brother of Dilip Kumar, acted in 'Lal Kunwar' (1952) could do well under a good director. He was much interested in puzzles and often asked puzzles on the sets from his co-aristes. Suraiya acted with Motilal as his heroine in three films, 'Do Dil', 'Aaj Ki Raat' and 'Lekh'. Motilal made a perfect lover on the sets, as he was a 'natural actor'. Mukesh acted in 'Mashuka' (1953) with her and was self-conscious on the sets at first and Suraiya had to guide her at first. Suraiya said that she had known Surendra since her childhood when he was already a grown-up person. She acted in two films with Surendra, viz. 'Anmol Ghadi' (1946) and '1857' (1946). Surendra once told her, when she was acting as a heroine opposite him, that he had saved her as a child from a car on the road when she was a toddler. According to Suraiya, Dev Anand was a debonair, handsome actor, who acted in the maximum number of films (seven) with her. Although, Dev Anand believed himself to be a \"tough\" guy, he actually was not. He had a habit of pulling Suraiya's hair between takes. He could play all types of roles, but hated singing roles. His greeting \"hello\" to all, while entering the sets, was known to everyone. Suraiya spoke highly of Noor Jehan, a few years her senior in acting, in an interview to 'Times of India' newspaper on 25 December 2000. \"Noor Jehan was my ideal. Noor Jehan was the most affectionate person, an ideal mother and a top class career woman. She was one of the greatest singer actresses the world has ever seen and the film industry has yet to produce another like her. I was only 14 years when I acted with Noor Jehan and was not a trained singer. But both Noor Jehan and Naushad encouraged me to sing in the film \"Anmol Ghadi\", I got a small role in the film but got noticed because of her. The film was a big hit and celebrated diamond jubilee in Novelty Cinema. It was a great experience with Noor Jehan, as she was friendly, witty and used to crack jokes and also used to give me tips for make up. She was like my sister, a great mother and a fighter who carried on with her career despite being a single mother\". On her death on 31 January 2004, the then Prime Minister of India, Atal Behari Vajpayee in a condolence message said Suraiya was \"not only a good actress but a talented singer\" and \"the legendary singer was endowed with a mellifluous voice\". Information and Broadcasting Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Suraiya was \"one of the most popular singing superstars of the forties and her famous honey voice and rich songs will remain popular for all times to come. Her contribution to the development of the Indian cinema will be remembered for long\". O.P. Dutta, director-writer, the only living director (when she died) to have worked with her in \"Pyar Ki Jeet\" remembered her as \"a lonely heart and a bundle of unforgettable qualities\".\"Suraiya, Bano to me, was a bundle of unforgettable qualities. A sublime voice, the ring in the voice, the perfect diction, the effortless rendering. But she always insisted that she was no singer.\" \"There were congratulations all around (on her success in his film). But Suraiya insisted she was no great shakes as an actress. The argument was over when she gave a sterling performance in 'Bari Bahen'. The success made Suraiya smile that unforgettable smile that could send a thousand hearts aflutter. She was right at the top and I was very happy for her.\" Dilip Kumar, veteran actor, said on her passing away, \"She was a caring girl, very affectionate, particularly with junior artistes,\". \"Suraiya will be sorely missed, even though she had been a recluse for decades.\" Dev Anand said on her death, \"I felt sad when she died. One does feel sad at death. I did not go to her funeral because I would have been reminded of her past. I cried from a distance.\". In an interview with Simi Grewal in her show, 'Rendezvous with Simi Grewal', Dev Anand paid his ultimate tribute to Suraiya, speaking poignantly about their failed love affair and Suraiya's loneliness in life. He said \"in her death, maybe she was relieved of her sorrows in life\". Lata Mangeshkar, Suraiya's co-singer in her films 'Balam', 'Sanam' and 'Diwana', narrated to Subash K. Jha of 'The Times of India' newspaper, \"My eyes mist over when I remember Suraiyaji's stardom. Oh-ho-ho ho! 'Kya naam tha unka'! ('How popular was she!'). I used to just gaze at her long sleek car ('Cadillac'). I remembered her car's number by heart. 'Humlog sochte thay kitne bade artiste hain'! ('We would feel in awe, how big an artiste was she!'). People say Suraiyaji's death is a big loss to the film industry. But who went to see her when she was alive?\" Singer Nitin Mukesh said Suraiya had played heroine opposite his father, playback legend Mukesh, in the movie, 'Mashooka' (1953), as the lead actor.\u2018\u2018Papa was very fond of her. She met me at a couple of award functions and was always affectionate.\u2019\u2019 Jaya Bhaduri, actress and wife of actor Amitabh Bachan, poignantly remembered Suraiya in 2004 just after her death, while receiving \"Sansui Lifetime Achievement Award\", saying that more tributes should have come her way, on how big an artiste she was. Earlier, in 1974, Sulakshana Pandit, then an upcoming actress cum singer, in an interview to Hindi film magazine 'Mayapuri' said \"I want to to be a heroine cum singer like Suraiya. Her voice was fabulous, and she sang her own songs for films. I want to do the same.\"  Editor of the film weekly, 'Screen (magazine)', Rauf Ahmed, remembered her, \"She was the uncrowned queen of her time, a dazzling singing star. She took off from where Noor Jehan left when she went to Pakistan. When Suraiya acted with Dev Anand and Raj Kapoor, she was bigger than all of them\".\"...(For the Screen Videocon Lifetime Achievement Award (1996)), it was difficult to bring Suraiya to the Screen Awards ceremony. Till the last moment, we didn\u2019t know if she would arrive to collect the award,\" he said. The Outlook (magazine) wrote after her death: \"She evoked the kind of hysteria [in the late 1940s] that can be compared only with Rajesh Khanna in his heyday from 1969 to 1972. Ask any old-timer and they would confirm that people bunked offices, schools and colleges, even shops closed on the opening day of her films, to see her films first day, first show.\" The Hindu newspaper wrote about Suraiya, \"What can you say about a lady, who was courted by Dev Anand, respected by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, but feared by Lata Mangeshkar! That she was beautiful, talented, adored by millions, but died a lonely single woman? Or, that she was the best ever superstar singer-actress of Indian films, yet walked away to a self-imposed exile at the height of her glory? Yes, Suraiya was all this, plus \"a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma\" who resolutely shunned screen and media once she departed from the arc lights.\" Suraiya's songs, as a tribute to her, are played every year on her death anniversary on 31 January by Radio Sri Lanka (Hindi music) (formerly Radio Ceylon) and are recorded on YouTube by eraksoldies.

Dev Anand remembers Suraiya Dev Anand was closely emotionally involved with Suraiya during 1948\u20131951. He describes various facets of her personality in the following videos. (1) 'Rendezvouz with Simi Garewal Dev Anand Part-1' The TV interview of Dev Anand was conducted by Simi Garewal after Suraiya's death in 2004. Dev Anand comes out about their love-affair in quite a detailed way, and how he felt for Suraiya till her end. He said he did not go to meet her in her last days in the hospital, because he did not want to make a show of his sorrows. \"Your sorrows are the citadels of your loneliness, not to be shared with the world\", he said. (2) Dev Anand remembered Suraiya in an interview with Karan Thapar in 'Face to Face' for BBC in 2002. He said, he was in totally in love with Suraiya. His affair with Suraiya refined him and made a man out of him. About the question on eloping with Suraiya, he said he did not favour elopement. If he had married, it would have been with consent of her family. (3) In, possibly, his last interview on his birthday on 26 September 2011, Dev Anand said, if he cried for any girl in his life, it was Suraiya. Suraiya acted in the following films, along with singing her own songs in most of them. Three of Suraiya's films were left incomplete. 'Jaanwar' with Dilip Kumar (early 50s) was abandoned by Suraiya, owing to misbehaviour with her by the lead actor, Dilip Kumar and producer director, K. Asif. 'Pagalkhana' (also, in early 50s), with Bharat Bhushan as lead actor, was abandoned by the producer director P.L. Santoshi after eight reels, because of financial constraints. An English version of 'Wajid Ali Shah', starring Suraiya and Ashok Kumar in 1953, being filmed by British film director, Herbert Marshall, was shelved after being made for some time.

He has sung songs in some Bhojpuri films, Odia albums and bhajans and in Konkani films.   In 1968, when Suresh Wadkar was 13, Jialal Vasant encouraged him to work towards the \"Prabhakar\" certificate offered by the Prayag Sangit Samiti, because it was equivalent to a BEd and qualifies the awardee to teach professionally. Wadkar successfully completed his \"Prabhakar\" and joined Arya Vidya Mandir in Mumbai as a music teacher.[citation needed] He has a music school in Mumbai, India (www.ajivasan.com) and New Jersey/New York City (www.sureshwadkarmusic.com) where methodical training is given to students.

        "artist_name": "Sushma_Shrestha", 
        "biography": " Poornima Shrestha (Nepali: \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f\u092e\u093e \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0937\u094d\u0920 born c. 1960), also known as Sushma Shrestha, is a noted Bollywood playback singer who has sung many superhit songs in Indian music industries. Sushma started her career as a child singer in Ramesh Sippy's 1971 film Andaz. In that film, she sang under the music direction of Shankar Jaikishan the song \"Hai Na Bolo Bolo\" along with Mohammed Rafi, Suman Kalyanpur and Pratibha. The song went on to become a hit. She sang numerous Nepali songs; the most popular one is from the 1980 Nepali movie Sindoor, 'Ali Ali Haar Ho'. She is mostly remembered for her songs like \"Tera Mujhse Hai Pehle\" from Aa Gale Lag Jaa (1973) and \"Kya Hua Tera Vada\" from Hum Kisise Kum Naheen (1977); both earned her nominations for the Filmfare Best Female Playback Award. Poornima has sung other popular numbers like \"Channe Ke Khet Main\" from Anjaam (1994) and in a series of David Dhawan films like such as Coolie No. 1 (1995), Judwaa (1997), Hero No. 1 (1997) and Biwi No.1 (1999) amongst others. Apart from Hindi, Poornima Shreshta has sung number of Marathi film and non-film songs. These include Baal Geet (children's songs), Bhavgeet etc.Music director duo Anand-Milind were very fond of her voice in early 90s and gave her many chances to sing their songs. She sang many hit songs for actresses like Juhi Chawla, Madhuri Dixit, Shilpa Shirodkar, Karishma Kapoor, Raveena Tandon, Kajol, Rani Mukherji, Madhu, Tabu, Sridevi etc.   Sushma's father was a music composer, Bholanath. She lost her father on 12 April 1971 when she was barely 11 years old. She sang the hit \"Hai Na Bolo Bolo\" when she was just nine. She has sung many super hit songs in her childhood: \"Tera Mujhse Hai Nata Koi\", \"Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na\", \"Yaadon Ki Baarat\" are a few. Poornima is the oldest singer in terms of experience in the industry who can boast of having worked with Naushad, Madan Mohan, C. Ramchandra, Anil Biswas, S.D. Burman and Shankar Jaikishan. She got her first break accidentally when Chandrakant Bhosle, a family friend and an assistant to Shankar\u2013Jaikishan recommended her name to Shankar. In spite of the prevailing custom of women playback singers singing for children, Shankar took upon him the challenge of taking an unknown child to sing \"Hai Na Bolo Bolo\" for the film Andaz. Sushama recorded her first song on 11 November 1969 with Mohammed Rafi and Suman Kalyanpur. Rafi was very impressed by her singing. Sushma did a children's album called Bal Geet, which had the legendary S.Khale composing the songs and Shanta Shelke penning them. She sang four songs in it. The album proved as huge hit and gave immense exposure to Poornima who surprised everybody by singing Marathi songs with ease. Her career was planned to be launched at a function organised by the Punjab Association organised by Raj Kapoor, Pran and others. Slated to perform on 12 April 1971, tragedy struck on 11 April when her father suffered a cardiac arrest and died. She was undaunted and was encouraged by family and friends. She gave a performance, which impressed many and enabled her to get a scholarship of Rs. 250 to study music. Marriage put a temporary halt to her singing career with regard to films as she stopped doing stage shows, which promptly dried up the offers for playback. Her last song as Sushma Shreshtha was in N.Chandra's Ankush: \"Itni Shakti Humein Dena Data\" (along with main singer Pushpa Pagdhare \u2013 in Hindi movie Ankush filmed on Ashalata Wabgaonkar, Nana Patekar, Suhas Palshikar and others). Jingles took her attention where the professionalism made her settle to a steady work schedule. In the 1990s, Tips, the music company approached her with an offer. Wanting to make a clean departure from the child prodigy image, they suggested a change of name and image. Sushma took the name Poornima. Her song \"Barsaat Mein Jab Aayega Saawan Ka Maheena\" from Maa was a hit. Few things changed till David Dhawan's Bol Radha Bol. \"Tu Tu Tu Tu Tara\" was nothing short of an anthem and the remaining songs, which were a success also, gave Poornima the opportunity to savour success and adulation that had eluded for long. She continued her association with Dhawan, she went on to sing for all his No. 1 series including Haseena Maan Jayegi and Biwi No.1. In spite of the lacklustre Indi-pop scene last year,[when?] Poornima was one of the top-ten selling artistes with her album Mera Dil Bole Piya Piya. With the adage \"slow and steady wins the race\" enforcing her nearly three comebacks, more of her has yet to come. \"Piratii ko kitaab maa naulo paanaa thapchhaun\" Best Female Playback singer, Zee Cine Awards (1998) \u2013 Sona Kitna Sona Hain (Hero No. 1) (Nominated, did not win)"

        "biography": " www.talatmahmood.net Talat Mahmood (Hindi: \u0924\u0932\u0924 \u092e\u0939\u092e\u0942\u0926, Urdu: \u0637\u0644\u0639\u062a \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f\u200e;(24 February 1924 \u2013 9 May 1998) is considered one of the greatest male Indian non-classical and semi-classical singers. He was a born singer with an intuitive sense of beauty, charm and grace. He was an Indian playback singer. Although he tried his luck as a film actor, he didn't succeed a great deal in acting. Talat received Padma Bhushan in 1992, in recognition of his artistic contributions in the spheres of cinematic and ghazal music. he had a unique, elegant and profoundly artistic style of singing. Talat was a very gifted singer in every sense. He was particularly famous for singing soft and sombre semi-classical and non-classical ghazals, but the film songs sung by him are also considered critically flawless and outstanding. Although Talat's typical genre was Ghazal, he was an astoundingly brilliant film singer who sung innumerable fantastic film songs. Romantic and tragic were the moods he liked most and it was he who helped a great deal in shaping the style and method of modern ghazal singing. He can be described as the real founder of modern semi-classical and non-classical ghazal. During the 1950s and 60s, Talat was the first choice of the high-brow literary and artistic community of Indian sub-continent, especially Urdu-speaking community. Even his cancelled songs were immensely popular among them. No other singer had such intellectually high-class and learned audience at the time with an exception of Manna Dey. Talat's voice has often been described as the softest male voice of the Indian sub-continent; not only this, but his voice is also considered among the most soulful male voices ever heard in the Indian sub-continent.   Talat Mahmood was born in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, to Manzoor Mahmood. Talat showed his musical leanings from a very young age and would enjoy sitting through all-night music soirees listening patiently to some of the biggest names in classical Indian music then. Coming from a conservative Muslim background, singing was not encouraged. Talat had to choose between working in films and staying at home. Despite his parental objection he opted for the former, though his family accepted the fact only about a decade later when he gained respect in the industry. Talat apprenticed classical music under Pandit S.C.R. Bhat at Marris College of Music, Lucknow (presently Bhatkhande Music Institute) some time in late-30s. He started his career purely as a ghazal singer in 1939. Talat Mahmood began his singing career at the age of 16 in 1939 when he began singing the Ghazals of Daag, Mir, Jigar etc. on All India Radio, Lucknow. His voice had a quality distinct from all the other singers. HMV was quick to notice this and offered Talat his first disc in 1941 Sab din ek samaan nahin tha, Bun jaoon ga kya se kya main, Iska to kuch dhyan nahin tha. His reputation as a ghazal singer was not limited to his hometown of Lucknow, but it reached the city that proved to shape his destiny \u2013 Calcutta. The then famous ghazal singers were Ustad Barkat Ali Khan, K.L. Saigal and M.A. Rauf. The classical songs he sang were \" Sapnon Ki Suhaani Duniyaa Ko \" for film Shikast and \" Laage Tose Naina \" for Chaandi Ki Deewar. In 1944 came the hit Tasveer teri dil mera behela nah sake gi. Its popularity was so phenomenal and unrivalled that even today it remains one of the top selling non-film discs[citation needed]. This disc brought Talat the fame throughout India and soon he was beckoned by the Calcutta film industry. Talat made cameo appearances and starred in about 16 movies, for both the Calcutta (film hub of the 1940s) and Bombay Film Industry. The three movies in which he starred were regional hits in Calcutta. Initially, in Calcutta, he recorded a lot of Bangla songs (basic album) under the assumed name of \"Tapankumar\". Several of his Bangla numbers were super hits in Bengal and are still aired on All India Radio old song reminisces. He sang to the tune of eminent music directors like Kamal Dasgupta [\" Du'ti paakhi du'ti teere... \"], Sudhin Dasgupta [\" Ei rimjhimjhim barosha... \"], Rabin Chattopadhyayaa [ \" Chander eto aalo... \" ], Hemanta Mukhopadhayay [ \" E Jodi aakash hoy... \" ] and V. Balsara [ \" Tumi sundar jodi nahi... \" ] during the 50s and early 60s. In 1949 Talat moved to Bombay, to sing for the Hindi film industry. His name and fame had already preceded him and soon he was flooded with offers. His big break came with the song Ae dil mujhe aisi jagha le chal jahan koi na ho composed by music director Anil Biswas for the soundtrack of the movie Arzoo. The song proved to be extremely popular. Talat Mehmood was the real founder of modern semi-classical and non-classical ghazal. So, his influence upon other contemporary and succeeding ghazal singers has been broad and profound. It was he who paved the way for such legendary ghazal singers as Mehdi Hassan and Jagjit Singh. Hence he will always be placed very high for his contributions to transform and revitalize the whole art and form ghazal singing. Talat Mehmood can safely be placed among the greatest male gazal and/or film singers of the Indian subcontinent together with the singers like K. L. Saigal, Mohammed Rafi, Ahmed Rushdi, Mehdi Hassan, Manna Dey, K. J. Yesudas, Ustad Amanat Ali Khan, Kishore Kumar, Jagjit Singh, Ustad Ghulam Ali and Mukesh. Because of his soft and silky voice, subtly intricate and detailed method, correct pronunciation, infallible striking of the notes that are being tried,very sound knowledge of Indian music, striking the right note on the right time, and never missing a single bit of a beat, Talat conquered the souls of countless people throughout the globe, wherever Urdu and Hindi are spoken and understood. He is particularly and immensely popular among learned Urdu-speaking audiences having literary or artistic background, especially in Pakistan. Talat was a member of the famous male singers' troika of the 1950s who had their respective separate fan-followings throughout the Indian subcontinent, the other two were Muhammad Rafi and Mukesh.This famous troika was the most popular group of the film singers of the 1950s in the entire sub-continent, who enjoyed the largest audience ever existed during any period of sub-continent's cinematic history. Talat exerted a profound influence upon the ghazal singing of his time with his immensely melodious voice and artistic craftsmanship, particularly suitable for typically semi-classical ghazal singing. He was born to be a Ghazal singer, with his majestic style and brilliant diction he conquered not only the hearts of innumerable high-brow listeners but also common folks of his time. He was the heart-favorite singer of the older and maturer audience of his time, and this type of audience still listens to him more than any of the ghazal singers who ever sung except the Shahenshah-e-Ghazal Mehdi Hassan and Jagjit Singh. So, in a sense, he still necessarily is a member of another troika, to be more precise, the three most influential ghazal singers of all time. Talat particularly and profoundly influenced a whole generation of young singers who succeeded him; including legendary ghazal singers Jagjit Singh and Pankaj Udhas (who always honors him with the title of Shahenshah-E-Ghazal), singer Sajjad Ali and playback singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya.[citation needed] G. M. Durrani was a model to many playback singers who followed then. The soulful renditions of Durrani were to be reminded of by Talat's singing as well. Besides being a gifted singer, Mahmood was quite handsome as well. He acted in over a dozen films with top actresses of the time like Nutan, Mala Sinha, Suraiya and others. Later he decided to give up acting to concentrate on singing. Talat acted in the following Hindi films : The advent of rock-n-roll in the late 1960s sidelined singers like Talat. As long as he was top box-office draw, the movie producers insisted on including his songs in their movies. Talat's velvety vocals posed a special challenge to the music-composers, most of whom leaned towards the deep baritones of Mohammad Rafi and Mukesh. The resultant demise of his movie career led to the decline of his singing career. At the same time, the social changes and happiness brought about by increasing prosperity in India meant that blue mood ghazals and heart-rending ballads were not popular any more. Talat continued to record good songs, but less in number. His last soundtrack recording, in 1985, is the song \"Mere Shareek-e-Safar\", a duet sung with Miss Hemlata, from the movie \"Wali-e-Azam\" composed by Chitragupt and written by Ahmed Wasi. However, Talat who was the first Indian singer to go on foreign concert tours in 1956 to East Africa found eager fans awaiting his arrival in other foreign countries. Jam packed audience in the United States, the UK, West Indies and other countries awaited his arrival enthusiastically. He performed in famous Royal Albert Hall in London, Madison Square Garden in the States and Jean Pierre Complex in the West Indies. He continued singing in the packed auditoriums until 1991 when he toured Holland. Talat sang about 800 songs in his long career. His songs are still popular among the music lovers as they were in the days these were released. Talat married a Bengali Christian girl from Calcutta, who also acted in films and was a great fan of his, Latika Mullick, later named Nasreen on 20 February 1951 and had two children Khalid born in 1953 and Sabina born in 1959. People, who were close to Talat, describe his nature as a quiet one. He is often remarked as a decent man, and his velvety and silky voice also reflected that decency and sense of calmness. Music directors, who worked with him, claimed that while listening to him, one would develop the feeling that Talat was a soft-hearted man. Dilip Kumar termed Talat as \"a perfect gentleman\". He was a fine gentleman who always had time and respect for his admirers. Talat sang approximately 800 songs spread over 4 decades spanning between the 40s and 80s. Some of the most popular work of Talat is available even today with the following titles: Even though Talat sang hundreds of hits, some of his most memorable songs from Indian cinema are: Talat Mahmood has sung a for a Malayalam movie 'Dweep'.

        "biography": " Usha Khanna (Hindi: \u0909\u0937\u093e \u0916\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e; born 7 October 1941) is an Indian music director in Hindi cinema. She is the third female music director to enter the Indian film industry, after Jaddan Bai and Saraswati Devi and is one of the most commercially successful music directors in the male dominated music industry. She is most known for songs like \"Chodo kal ki baatein\", \"Shaayad meri shaadi ka khayal\", \"Zindagi pyaar ka geet hai\" and \"Aap to aise na the\". She remained active for more than 3 decades from 1960s to 1980s. She is still active making some music for some movies and television-serials, more than 40 years after her debut as music director in Dil Deke Dekho (1959). She received a Filmfare Award nomination for composing the songs for the huge hit film Souten (1983). She was married to director, producer, lyricist, Sawan Kumar Tak, from whom she separated later on.   Born in Gwalior, her father, Manohar Khanna, was a lyricist and singer, working as Assistant Superintendent in the Water Works Department in then Gwalior State. When he came to Bombay (now Mumbai) for some work in 1946 he met Jaddanbai who was mother of Hindi film actress Nargis Dutt.On her request he started writing Gazals for Hindi films by the name, Jaaved Anwar .He was getting a monthly salary of Rs. 250 in Gwalior State and Jaddanabi offered him Rs. 800 for 3 gazals which he wrote for Jaddanbai,s Nargis Art Productions film Romeo Juliet . Usha Khanna did often take inspiration from Arabic music, which she liked and she claims that she has never lifted any song directly, but that she has composed something along the lines. The popular music director O. P. Nayyar introduced Usha Khanna to Sashadhar Mukherjee, a powerful man in the Indian film industry at that time. She sang a song for Mukherjee, and when he realised that she had composed the song on her own, he told her to compose two songs per day for one year. After a few months, Mukherjee signed her as the composer for his movie Dil Deke Dekho (1959) as a music composer. The film, which also introduced the actress Asha Parekh, became a big hit, and Mukherjee hired her again for another Asha Parekh starrer Hum Hindustani (1961). After she started composing music for Hindi movies, Usha Khanna struggled to establish herself as a music director, despite producing many hit songs. She often collaborated with Asha Bhosle, who referred to Usha Khanna as her daughter, and Mohammed Rafi. This trio produced many hit songs.Many of songs sung by Mohammed Rafi under composition of Usha Khanna are still very popular and will be everlasting forever. DIL DEKE DEKHO (1959). HAWAS (1974), SAJAAN KI SAHELI (1981),AAP THO AISE NA THE (1980) as to named a few good songs of movie of Rafi Usha Association. Saawan Kumar was often the lyricist for Usha Khanna, and wrote most of his lyrics for her songs. He directed and produced the lyrics for eleven movies she scored the music for. In 1979 K. J. Yesudas received Filmfare award for her song Dil ke tukde tukde in the film Dada. Usha Khanna was married to Sawan Kumar Tak but later they separated and she lives in Bombay (present name Mumbai). The effort she had put earlier in life to establish herself in the industry, made her realise how difficult it was to break through, and this made her often give the chance to new singers. She gave the chance to the singers who were little known at that time \u2013 Anupama Deshpande, Pankaj Udhas, Hemlata, Mohammed Aziz, Roop Kumar Rathod, Shabbir Kumar, and Sonu Nigam. Many of these went on to become notable singers. Usha Khanna herself also sang a few songs as a playback singer. Many of Usha Khanna's songs are still very popular. Some of the other movies she provided for are 'Shabnam', 'Aankh Micholi', Saajan Bina Suhagan, 'Sautan', 'Sajan ki Saheli', 'Ab Kya Hoga', 'Lal Bungalow', 'Dada', 'Do Khiladi', 'Hanste Khelte'. Usha Khanna remained quite active as a composer until the mid-nineties. Until now, the last movie she has given music to was in 2003. The movie was Dil Pardesi Ho Gaya, produced and directed by her ex-husband Saawan Kumar who she was briefly married to. Usha Khanna has given music to non-Hindi movies too. The Malayalam movie Moodal Manju (1969) is still remembered for some of the finest songs in Malayalam including 'Nee Madhu Pakaroo' by K. J. Yesudas and 'Maanasa Mani veenayil' by S.Janaki. Agni nilavu and Puthooram Puthri Unniyarcha are the other Malayalam movies done by her. Why she did not get many chances remains a mystery for many music lovers even now."

        "biography": " Usha Uthup (born 7 November 1947) is an Indian pop, jazz and playback singer who sang songs in the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Darling, which she recorded with Rekha Bhardwaj for the film 7 Khoon Maaf, won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer in 2012.   Usha was born in Bombay (now Mumbai). Her father was Vaidyanath Someshwar Sami who hailed from Madras (now Chennai), in Tamil Nadu in 1947. She studied at St. Agnes High School (Clare Road,Byculla). When she was in school she was thrown out of music class because she didn't fit in with a voice like hers. But her music teacher recognised that she had some music in her and would give her clappers or triangles to play. Even though she was not formally trained in music, she grew up in an atmosphere of music. Her parents used to listen to a wide range from Western classical to Hindustani and Carnatic including Kishori Amonkar and Bade Ghulam Ali Khan on radio and she used to join them. She used to enjoy listening to Radio Ceylon. Her next door neighbour was S.M.A. Pathan, who was then the deputy commissioner of police. His daughter, Jamila, influenced Usha to learn Hindi and take up Indian classical music. This fusion approach helped her to pioneer her unique brand of Indian pop in the 1970s. She is married to Mr Jani Uthup from Kottayam, Kerala. She is presently a resident of Kolkata, West Bengal. Her first public singing occurred when she was nine. Her sisters who were already exploring a music career, took her to the most popular radio announcer in India that time called Ameen Sayani who gave her an opportunity to sing on the Ovaltine Music Hour in Radio Ceylon. She sang a number called \"Mockingbird Hill\". After that, several appearances followed through her teenage years. Usha Uthup started singing in a small nightclub in Chennai called as Nine Gems in the basement of the erstwhile Safire theatre complex on Mount Road, when she was 20, wearing a saree and leg callipers. Her performance was so well received that the owner of the nightclub asked her to stay on for a week. After her first night club gig, she began singing in Calcutta at night clubs such as \"Trincas\". She met her future husband Uthup in Trincas. At about the same time, she also sang at \"Talk of the Town\", now known as \"Not Just Jazz by the Bay\" in Bombay (now Mumbai). After Trincas, her next engagement took her to Delhi where she sang at the Oberoi hotels. By happenstance, a film crew belonging to Navketan unit including Shashi Kapoor visited the nightclub and they offered her a chance to sing movie playback. As a result, she started her Bollywood career with Hare Rama Hare Krishna. Originally, she was supposed to sing Dum Maro Dum along with Asha Bhosle. However, as a result of internal politicking on the part of other singers, she lost that chance but ended up singing an English verse. In 1968, she recorded covers of two pop songs in English, \"Jambalaya\" and The Kingston Trio's \"Greenback Dollar\", on an EP, Love Story, and \"Scotch and Soda\", another Kingston Trio song, which sold very well in the Indian market. She also spent some time in London during this early period. She was a frequent visitor to Vernon Corea's BBC office at the Langham in London and was interviewed on London Sounds Eastern on BBC Radio London. Usha visited Nairobi as part of an Indian festival. She was so popular that she was invited to stay on. Singing and quite often nationalistic songs in Swahili made her extremely popular and the then President Jomo Kenyatta made her an Honorary Citizen of Kenya. She sang the famous song \"Malaika\" (angel) with Fadhili Williams who was the original singer. She produced a record \"live in Nairobi\" with a local band Fellini Five. Uthup sang several songs in the 1970s and 1980s for music directors R D Burman and Bappi Lahiri. She also reprised some of R.D. Burman songs that were sung by others such as Mehbooba Mehbooba and Dum Maro Dum and popularised them to a distinct end. Uthup also sang for a two-volume collection of children's rhymes \"Karadi Rhymes\", which are \"Indian Rhymes for Indian Kids\", brought out by Karadi Tales (www.karaditales.com). The rhymes reflect the Indian ethos through the Sa-re-ga-ma, mangoes, Indian rivers, the train experiences, Indian festivals, indigenous trees, Cricket, Indian foods like bhelpuri and sambhar, Indian attire like the dhoti, sari, bindi and bangles and even some folk tales. With each rhyme set to an Indian raga, and sung in her characteristic voice with a feisty tempo, Usha creates the atmosphere for children and, surprisingly, even adults to sing along and dance to the toe-tapping beats. She appeared as a judge on a singing reality show Bharat Ki Shaan: Singing Star \u2013 Season 2 (2012), aired on DD National channel, along with Ismail Darbar.
