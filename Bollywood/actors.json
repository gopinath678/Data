        "biography": " Aamir Khan (pronounced\u00a0[\u02c8a\u02d0m\u026ar \u02c8xa\u02d0n]; born Mohammed Aamir Hussain Khan on 14 March 1965) is an Indian film actor, director, and producer. Through his career in Hindi films, Khan has established himself as one of the most popular and influential actors of Indian cinema. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including four National Film Awards and eight Filmfare Awards. He was honoured by the Government of India with the Padma Shri in 2003 and the Padma Bhushan in 2010. Khan first appeared on screen as a child actor in his uncle Nasir Hussain's film Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973). His first feature film role came with the experimental film Holi (1984), and he began a full-time acting career with a leading role in the tragic romance Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988). His performance in the film and in the thriller Raakh (1989) earned him a Special Mention at the National Film Award ceremony. He established himself as a leading actor of Hindi cinema in the 1990s by appearing in several commercially successful films, including the romantic drama Dil (1990), the romance Raja Hindustani (1996), for which he won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor, and the drama Sarfarosh (1999). He was also noted for playing against type in the critically acclaimed Canadian-Indian film Earth (1998). In 2001, Khan started a production company, whose first release, Lagaan, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and earned him a National Film Award for Best Popular Film and two more Filmfare Awards (Best Actor and Best Film). After a four-year absence from the screen, Khan continued to portray leading roles, most notably in the 2006 box-office hits Fanaa and Rang De Basanti. The following year, he made his directorial debut with Taare Zameen Par, a major success that garnered him the Filmfare Awards for Best Film and Best Director. Khan's greatest commercial successes came with the thriller Ghajini (2008), the comedy-drama 3 Idiots (2009), the action film Dhoom 3 (2013), the satire PK (2014) and the sports biopic Dangal all of which held records for being the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time. Khan won his third Best Actor award at Filmfare for Dangal (2016). In addition to acting, Khan is a humanitarian and has participated and spoken out for various social causes, some of which have sparked political controversy. He has created and hosted the television talk show Satyamev Jayate, through which he highlights sensitive social issues in India. Khan was married to his first wife, Reena Dutta, for fifteen years, after which he married the film director Kiran Rao. He has three children\u2014two with Dutta, and one with Rao through surrogacy.   Khan was born on 14 March 1965 in Mumbai to Tahir Hussain, a film producer, and Zeenat Hussain. Several of his relatives were members of the Hindi film industry, including his late paternal uncle, the producer-director Nasir Hussain. He is related to the Indian philosopher Abul Kalam Azad who is related to him through his grandmother. Khan is the eldest of four siblings; he has a brother, the actor Faisal Khan, and two sisters, Farhat and Nikhat Khan (married to Santosh Hegde). His nephew, Imran Khan, is a contemporary Hindi film actor. As a child, Khan appeared on screen in two minor roles. At the age of eight, he appeared in a highly popular song in the Nasir Hussain-directed musical film Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973). The following year, he portrayed the younger version of Mahendra Sandhu's character in his father's production Madhosh. Khan attended J.B. Petit School for his pre-primary education, later switching to St. Anne's High School, Bandra till the eight grade, and completed his ninth and tenth grade at the Bombay Scottish School, Mahim. He played tennis in state level championships, and has professed being \"much more into sports than studies\". He completed his twelfth grade from Mumbai's Narsee Monjee College. Khan described his childhood as \"tough\" due to the financial problems faced by his father, whose film productions were mostly unsuccessful. He said, \"There would be at least 30 calls a day from creditors calling for their money.\" He was always at risk of being expelled from school for non-payment of fees. At the age of sixteen, Khan was involved in the experimental process of making a 40-minute silent film, Paranoia, which was directed by his school friend Aditya Bhattacharya. The film was funded by the filmmaker Shriram Lagoo, an acquaintance of Bhattacharya, who provided them with a few thousand rupees. Khan's parents did not want him to make films, wishing that he would instead pursue a \"steady\" career as an engineer or doctor. For that reason, the shooting schedule of Paranoia was a clandestine one. In the film, he played the lead role alongside actors Neena Gupta and Victor Banerjee, while simultaneously assisting Bhattacharya. He said that the experience of working on it encouraged him to pursue a career in film. Khan subsequently joined a theatre group called Avantar, where he performed backstage activities for over a year. He made his stage debut with a small role in the company's Gujarati play, Kesar Bina, at Prithvi Theatre. He went on to two of their Hindi plays, and one English play, which was titled Clearing House. After completing high school, Khan decided to discontinue studying, choosing instead to work as an assistant director to Nasir Hussain on the Hindi films Manzil Manzil (1984) and Zabardast (1985). In addition to assisting Hussain, Khan acted in documentaries directed by the students of FTII, Pune. The director Ketan Mehta noticed Khan in those films, and he offered him a role in the low-budget experimental film Holi (1984). Featuring an ensemble cast of newcomers, Holi was based on a play by Mahesh Elkunchwar, and dealt with the practice of ragging in India. The New York Times said that the film was \"melodramatic\" but \"very decently and exuberantly performed by the nonprofessional actors\". Khan's role was that of a rowdy college student, an \"insignificant\" role that was described by CNN-IBN as \"lack[ing] in finesse\". Holi failed to garner a broad audience, but Nasir Hussain and his son Mansoor signed him as the leading man in Mansoor's directorial debut Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988) alongside Juhi Chawla. The film was a tale of unrequited love and parental opposition based on the Shakespearean tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, with Khan portraying Raj, a \"clean-cut, wholesome boy-next-door\". Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak proved to be a major commercial success, catapulting both Khan and Chawla to stardom. It received seven Filmfare Awards including a Best Male Debut trophy for Khan. The film has since attained cult status, with the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama crediting it as a \"path-breaking and trend setting film\" for Indian cinema. The year 1989 saw the release of Raakh, a crime thriller from Aditya Bhattacharya that was filmed before the production of Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak. The film tells the story of a young man avenging the rape of his ex-girlfriend (played by Supriya Pathak). Despite a poor reception at the box office, the film was critically acclaimed. Khan was awarded a National Film Award\u00a0\u2013 Special Jury Award / Special Mention for his performances in both Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak and Raakh. Later that year, he reunited with Chawla for the romantic comedy Love Love Love, a commercial failure. Khan had five film releases in 1990. He found no success in the sport film Awwal Number with Aditya Pancholi and Dev Anand, the mythological thriller Tum Mere Ho, the romance Deewana Mujh Sa Nahin and the social drama Jawani Zindabad. However, the Indra Kumar-directed romantic drama Dil (opposite Madhuri Dixit) was a major success. A tale of parental opposition to teenage love, Dil was highly popular among the youth, and emerged as the highest-grossing Hindi film of the year. He followed this success with a leading role alongside Pooja Bhatt in the romantic comedy Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin (1991), a remake of the Hollywood film It Happened One Night (1934), which proved to be a box office hit. Khan appeared in several other films in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar (1992), Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke (1993) (for which he also wrote the screenplay), and Rangeela (1995). Most of these films were successful critically and commercially. Other successes include Andaz Apna Apna, co-starring Salman Khan. At the time of its release, the movie was reviewed unfavorably by critics, but over the years has gained cult status. Khan continued to act in just one or two films a year, then an unusual trait for a mainstream Hindi cinema actor. His only release in 1996 was the Dharmesh Darshan-directed commercial blockbuster Raja Hindustani, in which he was paired opposite Karisma Kapoor. The film earned him his first Filmfare Best Actor Award, after seven previous nominations, and went on to become the biggest hit of the year, as well as the third-highest grossing Indian film of the 1990s. Khan's career seemed to hit a plateau at this point of time, and most of the films to follow for the next few years were only partially successful. In 1997, he co-starred alongside Ajay Devgn, Kajol and Juhi Chawla in Ishq, which performed well at the box office. The following year, Khan appeared in the moderately successful Ghulam, for which he also did playback singing. John Mathew Matthan's Sarfarosh, Khan's first release in 1999, was also moderately successful, gaining an above average box office verdict. The film and Khan's role in it were highly appreciated by movie critics, as was his role in Deepa Mehta's art house film Earth. His first release for the new millennium, Mela, in which he acted alongside his real-life brother Faisal Khan, was both a box-office and critical bomb. In 2001, he appeared in Lagaan. The film was a major critical and commercial success, and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the 74th Academy Awards. Additionally, the film gathered critical acclaim at several international film festivals, in addition to winning numerous Indian awards, including the National Film Awards. Khan himself won his second Filmfare Best Actor Award. The success of Lagaan was followed by Dil Chahta Hai later that year, in which Khan co-starred with Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna, with Preity Zinta playing his love interest. The film was written and directed by the then-debutant Farhan Akhtar. The film won the 2001 Filmfare Best Film Critics Award. Khan then took a four-year break from Bollywood after divorce from his wife Reena Dutta. Khan made a comeback in 2005 with Ketan Mehta's Mangal Pandey: The Rising playing the title role of the real-life sepoy and martyr who helped spark the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The film was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's award-winning Rang De Basanti was Khan's first release in 2006. His performance was critically acclaimed, earning him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor and various nominations for Best Actor. The film went on to become one of the highest-grossing films of the year, and was selected as India's official entry to the Oscars. Although the film was not shortlisted as a nominee for the Oscar, it received a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language at the BAFTA Awards in England. In his next movie, Fanaa (2006), Khan co-starred with Kajol. The film became one of the highest-grossing Indian films of 2006. His 2007 film, Taare Zameen Par, was also produced by him and marked his directorial debut. The film, which was the second offering from Aamir Khan Productions, starred Khan in a supporting role as a teacher who befriends and helps a dyslexic child. It opened to excellent responses from critics and audiences. Khan's performance was well-received, although he was particularly applauded for his directing. Khan received the Filmfare Awards for Best Director and Best Film of 2007, as well as the National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare. The film won other awards, including the 2008 Zee Cine Awards and 4th Apsara Film & Television Producers Guild Awards. The film was initially acclaimed as India's official entry for the 2009 Academy Awards Best Foreign Film. In 2008, Khan appeared in the movie Ghajini. The film was a major commercial success and became the highest-grossing Bollywood movie of that year. For his performance in the film, Khan received several Best Actor nominations at various award ceremonies as well as his fifteenth Filmfare Best Actor nomination. In 2009, Khan appeared in the commercially and critically acclaimed film 3 Idiots as Ranchodas Chanchad. 3 Idiots became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time in India, breaking the previous record set by Ghajini, which also starred Khan. The film grossed \u20b9202 crore (US$31\u00a0million). 3 Idiots was of the few Indian films to become a major success in East Asian markets such as China and Japan, eventually bringing its overseas total to US$25 million\u2014the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time in overseas markets. It was expected to be the first Indian film to be officially released on YouTube, within 12 weeks of releasing in theatres on 25 March 2010, but finally got officially released on YouTube in May 2012. The film also won six Filmfare Awards (including best film and best director), ten Star Screen Awards, eight IIFA Awards and three National Film Awards. It was reported that Khan had disagreements with director Reema Kagti over the issue of his 2012 film Talaash, causing significant delays in the film's release. However, Khan said that the claims were baseless. The film was a hit in India and overseas markets. Khan's next venture was Dhoom 3 with Yash Raj Films. He has considered this to be the most difficult role of his career. The film was released worldwide on 20 December 2013. Box Office India declared Dhoom 3 \"the biggest hit of 2013\" after two days of release, with the film grossing \u20b92 billion (US$31\u00a0million) worldwide in three days and \u20b94 billion (US$62\u00a0million) worldwide in ten days, making it the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time. In 2014, Khan appeared as the eponymous alien in Rajkumar Hirani's comedy-drama PK. It also starred Anushka Sharma, Sushant Singh Rajput, Boman Irani and Sanjay Dutt in pivotal roles. The film received critical acclaim and emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time (the fourth time Khan achieved this feat). Khan's performance was unanimously praised by critics. Raja Sen called the film a \"triumph\" and said: \"Aamir Khan is exceptional in PK, creating an irresistibly goofy character and playing him with absolute conviction.\" In December 2016, Khan appeared as a wrestler in Nitesh Tiwari's Dangal, which he also produced. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time domestically, surpassing PK, making it the fifth time Khan had achieved this feat. Khan also won his third Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Khan will be making a guest appearance in Secret Superstar. Khan has also committed to starring in Thugs Of Hindostan with Amitabh Bachchan. This will be directed by Dhoom 3's director Vijay Krishna Acharya. See more: Aamir Khan Productions In 2001, Khan set up a production company known as Aamir Khan Productions. Its first film was Lagaan. The movie was released in 2001, starring Khan as the lead actor. The film was selected as India's official entry to the 74th Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category, but it lost to No Man's Land. The film won numerous awards at several Indian award functions such as Filmfare and IIFA, and won the National Film Award for Most Popular Film, an award shared between Khan and the film's director, Ashutosh Gowariker. Khan later commented on the loss of Lagaan at the Oscars: \"Certainly we were disappointed. But the thing that really kept us in our spirits was that the entire country was behind us\". For producing the documentary Madness in the Desert on the making of Lagaan, Khan and director Satyajit Bhatkal were awarded the National Film Award for Best Exploration/Adventure Film at the 51st National Film Awards ceremony. In 2007 he produced the drama Taare Zameen Par, which marked his directorial debut. Khan also played a supporting role in the film, sharing the screen with new child actor Darsheel Safary. The film was conceived of and developed by the husband and wife team of Amole Gupte and Deepa Bhatia. It is the story of a young child who suffers in school until a teacher identifies him as dyslexic. The movie was critically acclaimed, as well as a box office success. Taare Zameen Par won the 2008 Filmfare Best Movie Award as well as a number of other Filmfare and Star Screen Awards. Khan's work also won him the Best Director. In 2008, Khan launched his nephew Imran Khan's debut in the film Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na under his production house. The film was a big hit in India, and earned Khan another nomination for Best Movie at the Filmfare. In 2011, Khan released his home production Dhobi Ghat, which was directed by his wife Kiran Rao. In same year khan co-produced English language Black comedy film Delhi Belly with UTV Motion Pictures starring Imran Khan, Kunaal Roy Kapur, Vir Das. The film opened to critical acclaim and was a commercial success, with a domestic revenue of over \u20b9550 million (US$8.5\u00a0million). In 2012, Khan starred in Reema Kagti's neo-noir mystery film Talaash, which was a joint production of Excel Entertainment and Aamir Khan Productions. The film was declared a semi-hit in India and accumulated a worldwide gross of \u20b91.74 billion (US$27\u00a0million). Around August 2011, Khan started talks with Siddhartha Basu's BIG Synergy to host a talk show similar to The Oprah Winfrey Show. Khan made his television debut with his talk show, Satyamev Jayate. The show dealt with social issues. It started airing on 6 May 2012. Aamir was paid Rs. 30\u00a0million rupees per episode to host the Satyamev Jayate, and it made him the highest paid host in Indian television industry as of June 2012. Aamir, speaking on a radio channel, said that in view of phenomenal public response, he may come up with a second season of the show. The show went live simultaneously on Star Plus, STAR World and national broadcaster Doordarshan on the 11\u00a0am Sunday slot in eight languages, being the first to do so in India. Satyamev Jayate opened to positive reviews and feedback from social activists, media houses, doctors, and film and television personalities. Khan was also praised for his effort. In her review, Ritu Singh of IBN Live stated, \"Aamir Khan deserves an applause for bringing up such a sensitive issue and presenting it in a hard hitting way. The amount of research Aamir and his team has put into the show was clearly visible with the facts and figures presented. Every aspect of the issue was covered with great diligence.\" Parmita Uniyal from Hindustan Times praised the content and Khan for \"step[ing] in to do what journalists are supposed to do\u00a0\u2013 make a difference. The show is a classic example of that.\" Despite the initial hype and being labelled as the channel's most ambitious project till date, the initial viewership figures were not very encouraging; the show received an average television rating of 2.9 (with a reach of 14.4 million, it was watched by only 20% of TV viewers) in the six metros in its debut episode on 6 May. The rating was far lower than those of most other celebrity-hosted shows at the time. In October 2013, Khan also appeared as a guest celebrity contestant in the show Kaun Banega Crorepati for the promotion of his film Dhoom 3. In a 2009 interview, Khan stated that he tends to take an independent approach to the world of filmmaking, noting that he does not \"do different things; I try to do it in a different manner. I think every person should follow his/her dream and try and make it possible to create an ability to achieve it backed by its practicality.\" He has also indicated that he is more interested in the process of filmmaking than in the end result: \"For me, the process is more important, more joyful. I would like to have my entire concentration on the process right from the first step.\" Khan has a reputation for avoiding award ceremonies and not accepting any popular Indian film awards. Though nominated many times, Khan has not attended any Indian film award ceremonies and has stated that \"Indian film awards lack credibility\". When asked about the selection procedure and authenticity of popular Indian film awards, Aamir Khan said, \"Fact is that I have no objections to film awards per se. I just feel that if I don't value a particular film award, then I won't attend it either. Apart from the National Film Awards, I don't see any other award ceremony that I should give value to. My personal experience about these award ceremonies is that I don't trust them. I have no faith in them so I would prefer to stay away.\" In 2007, Khan was invited to have a wax imitation of himself put on display at Madame Tussauds in London. Khan declined, saying, \"It's not important to me\u00a0... people will see my films if they want to. Also, I cannot deal with so many things, I have bandwidth only for that much.\" Khan also endorsed brands including Coca-Cola, Godrej, Titan Watches, Tata Sky, Toyota Innova, Samsung, Monaco Biscuits and Snapdeal. In April 2013, he was among TIME magazine's list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. Khan was featured in the cover page of TIME magazine Asia edition in the September 2012 issue with title \"Khan's Quest\" \u2013 \"He is breaking the Bollywood mold by tackling India's social evils. Can an actor change a nation?\" In February 2015, Khan stated his views at a popular online comedy group All India Bakchod for its celebrity Roast episode. He said, \"I completely believe in freedom of speech, no issues. But we have to understand that we all have a certain responsibility. When I heard what was being described to me I felt it was a violent event.\" He further said violence is not just physical but it has verbal aspects to it. Calling the roast a shameless act, Khan did not spare even his friends from the film industry Karan, Ranveer and Arjun. In April 2006, Khan participated in the demonstrations put up by the Narmada Bachao Andolan committee with their leader Medha Patkar after the Gujarat government's decision to raise the height of the Narmada dam. He quoted to support adivasis (tribes), who might be displaced from their homes. Later he faced protests and a partial ban on his film Fanaa, but the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, supported him by saying, \"Everyone has the freedom of expression. If someone says something on a particular subject, that doesn't mean you should start protesting.\" Aamir also lent his support to the Janlokpal Bill Movement led by Anna Hazare in August 2011. He has been supporting common causes; when asked about views on entertainment tax in 2012 budget, Khan said, \"I don't want any reduction in that, all I expect is focus on education and nutrition.\" He quit the GOI's copyrights panels in February 2010 after facing sharp differences with other members. During the promotion of 3 Idiots, he journeyed to diverse parts of India, mostly to small towns, noting that \"film makers from Mumbai don't understand small town India.\" This experience of reaching out to \"regional India\" was extended in his debut TV show, Satyamev Jayate. On 16 July 2012, Khan met the prime minister and the minister for social justice and empowerment and discussed the plight of manual scavengers and sought eradication of manual scavenging in the country. On 30 November 2011, Khan was appointed national brand ambassador of UNICEF to promote child nutrition. He is part of the government-organised IEC campaign to raise awareness about malnutrition. \"I think in the last maybe six to eight months, there is a growing sense of despondency. When I chat with Kiran at home, she says, 'Should we move out of India?' That's a disastrous and big statement for Kiran to make. She fears for her child. She fears what the atmosphere around us will be. She feels scared to open the newspapers every day.\" In November 2015, Khan expressed his feelings around intolerance in India at an event in New Delhi hosted by the Indian Express newspaper Khan's remark about \"moving out of India\" started a debate on social media. Khan faced an intense backlash for his comments, while some voiced their agreement around his concerns. Several Bollywood actors criticised Khan's remark for intolerance, including Shatrughan Sinha, Anupam Kher, Raveena Tandon and Vivek Oberoi. Far-right political party Shiv Sena sharply criticised Khan's statement, labelling it as \"the language of treachery\". In the wake of the controversy, burning of posters took place in Ludhiana by the Sena party. As a result, the Khan family was given additional police protection. Political party Bharatiya Janata Party remarked the incident as a \"Moral Offence\". Khan, despite some criticism from Bollywood, received support from other celebrities and public figures including Hrithik Roshan Shah Rukh Khan Rahul Gandhi Mamata Banerjee Rajkumar Hirani Kabir Khan and Farah Khan. Khan later stated that he was not leaving the country. A lawsuit has been filed against Khan and Rao at Jaunpur in ACJM II court. He clarified his comments in January 2016, saying that he never meant that India was intolerant or he thought about leaving the country. He said that his comments were taken out of context and the media was responsible for it to some extent. Khan married Reena Dutta, who had a small part in Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, on 18 April 1986. They have two children, a son named Junaid and a daughter, Ira. Reena was involved briefly in Khan's career when she worked as a producer for Lagaan. In December 2002, Khan filed for divorce. Reena took custody of both children. On 28 December 2005, Khan married Kiran Rao, who had been an assistant director to Ashutosh Gowariker during the filming of Lagaan. On 5 December 2011, Khan and his wife announced the birth of their son, Azad Rao Khan, through a surrogate mother. In 2007, Khan lost a custody battle for his younger brother Faisal to their father, Tahir Hussain. His father died on 2 February 2010. A practising Muslim, Khan along with his mother Zeenat, performed Hajj, an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and a mandatory religious duty for Muslims, in 2013. In March 2015, Khan stated that he has quit non-vegetarian food and has adopted a vegan lifestyle after being inspired by his wife. Khan received 8 Filmfare Awards from 26 nominations,[a] including Best Actor award for Raja Hindustani, Lagaan and Dangal. In addition, Khan received honorary accolades including Padma Shri in 2003, Padma Bhushan in 2010 and Honorary Doctorate by Maulana Azad National Urdu University (MANUU) for his distinguished contributions to the Indian cinema and entertainment industry."

        "artist_name": "Abhay_Deol", 
        "biography": " Abhay Deol (also known as Abhay Singh Deol, born 15 March 1976) is an Indian film actor and producer of Hindi language films. Born in the influential Deol family of the Hindi cinema, he began acting at a young age in theater productions at his school. Deol made his on screen debut in 2005 with Imtiaz Ali's romantic comedy Socha Na Tha. After the modest success of his debut, Deol garnered praise for his performances in films including Manorama Six Feet Under (2007), which won him the Best Actor Award at the Indo-American Arts Council Film Festival, and the commercially successful Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye! (2008). His breakthrough role came in 2009 with the starring role as Dev in Anurag Kashyap's critically and commercially successful Dev.D, a modern day adaptation of the Bengali classic novel Devdas. With the success of the film, Deol gained wider recognition and further praise from film critics. Deol mainly appeared in independent films early in his career, but that changed in 2011 when he starred in Zoya Akhtar's Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, a road film that went to become one of the highest grossing films in Bollywood. His performance in the film was well received, and earned him his first nomination for Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. Deol has since appeared in commercially successful films including the drama film Raanjhanaa (2013), and the romantic comedy Happy Bhag Jayegi (2016), while simultaneously working in independent films including the war film Chakravyuh (2012), and the political thriller Shanghai (2012). Deol continuously garners attention for his portrayal of complex characters on screen, and is vociferous in his support for parallel cinema in India. He has often been labelled as a nonconformist or an unconventional actor by Indian media. Deol owns a production company, Forbidden Films which was established in 2009. In addition to his acting career, Deol is also an active philanthropist and supports various NGOs.   Deol was born into a Sikh family to Ajit Singh Deol and Usha Deol. He is the nephew of Film Actor Dharmendra, and the cousin of Esha Deol, Ahana Deol, Bobby Deol and Sunny Deol. Abhay Deol stated in an interview with Rediff that he is into acting not because of his father, but because he was involved in theatre since school. \"At 18, I decided to take the plunge. It took me 10 years because I didn't want to leave my education to get into films.\" Deol made his film debut in the 2005 Imtiaz Ali's Socha Na Tha, a romantic comedy where he starred opposite Ayesha Takia. The film garnered mostly positive reviews from critics and was a average grosser at the box-office. Deol's performance in the film was well received. His second film role was 2006's Ahista Ahista. Deol's first 2007 release was the multi-starrer comedy drama Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd. which emerged as a box-office success. Deol had two more releases in the year, the crime film Ek Chalis Ki Last Local and the thriller Manorama Six Feet Under. The latter won the Best Film at the Mahindra Indo-American Arts Council Film Festival in New York City, and Deol won the Best Actor Award. Deol's sole release of 2008 was black comedy film Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!. Directed by Dibakar Banerjee, the film had Deol portray a compulsive thief, Devinder Singh aka Bunty, and the film's plot follows his exploits. Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye! was met with critical acclaim, but suffered heavily because of the timing of its release, a day after the 2008 Mumbai attacks, leading to widespread fear of crowded places. Deol's breakthrough role came in 2009 when he portrayed the titular character in Anurag Kashyap's 2009 neo-noir film Dev.D, a modern day adaptation of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's classic Bengali romance novel Devdas. The idea behind the film was conceived by Kashyap during a conversation with Deol where the latter spoke about a man frequenting a Los Angeles strip club like a \"modern day Devdas\". Dev D. received widespread attention for its distinct visual style, experimental soundtrack, and the innovative narrative structure which was unprecedented for any Bollywood film. In a 4 out of 5 star review for Times of India, Nikhat Kazmi deemed Deol's performance in the film as a \"class act\". Deol appeared alongside Tannishtha Chatterjee in Road, Movie Deol made a cameo appearance for an Item number in the movie Tera Kya Hoga Johnny in 2010. In 2009, Deol launched a production company Forbidden Films, with Junction being the film to be picked up by the banner. In 2011, Deol starred in Zoya Akhtar's comedy drama road movie Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara alongside Hrithik Roshan, Farhan Akhtar, Katrina Kaif and Kalki Koechlin. The story that follows three friends, who have been inseparable since childhood, had him play the role of Kabir, an architect. They set off to Spain on a bachelor trip for Kabir who is set to be married to Natasha, an interior designer played by Koechlin. He trained to be a deep-sea diver for the film which was filmed in Spain.

        "biography": " Abhishek Bachchan (born 5 February 1976) is an Indian actor, producer and playback singer best known for his work in Hindi films. Part of the Bachchan family, he is the son of veteran actors Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan. He made his film debut in the war drama Refugee (2000), which did not perform well at the box office, but had earned him appreciation from critics. For the next few years, Bachchan starred in a series of unsuccessful films that failed to propel his career forward. Bachchan then established himself as a leading actor of Hindi cinema with the blockbuster action thriller Dhoom (2004). Since then, he has starred in several successful films, including Bunty Aur Babli (2005), Dus (2005), Bluffmaster (2005), Dhoom 2 (2006), Guru (2007), Sarkar Raj (2008), Dostana (2008), Bol Bachchan (2012) and Housefull 3 (2016). He has also featured in Dhoom 3 (2013) and Happy New Year (2014), both of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. In addition to three consecutive Filmfare Awards for Best Supporting Actor for his critically acclaimed performances in Yuva (2004), Sarkar (2005), and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), Bachchan has garnered the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi for producing the family dramedy Paa (2009). Since 2007, Bachchan has been married to actress Aishwarya Rai and the couple have a daughter.   Abhishek Bachchan was born on 5 February 1976 in Mumbai to veteran actors of Hindi cinema, Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan (\u0144ee Bhaduri), an accomplished actress in her own right. His grandfather, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, was a noted poet of the Nayi Kavita Literary Movement of the Hindi literature and professor at the Allahabad University in Uttar Pradesh, while his grandmother, Teji Bachchan, was a social activist. The original surname of his family is Srivastava, Bachchan being the pen name used by his grandfather. However, when Amitabh entered films, he did so under his father's pen name. Bachchan is of Kayastha heritage on his father's side, Bengali from his mother's side and Punjabi from his grandmother's side\u2013who moved from Faisalabad to Mumbai before the partition of India. Bachchan was dyslexic as a child; this was referred to by Aamir Khan in the film Taare Zameen Par. He attended Jamnabai Narsee School and Bombay Scottish School in Mumbai, Modern School, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi, and Aiglon College in Switzerland. He then attended Boston University, and subsequently moved to Bollywood. In 2000, Bachchan made his film debut playing the male lead in J. P. Dutta's war drama Refugee opposite Kareena Kapoor, who was also making her debut in the film. Although the film did not fare very well at the box office, both Bachchan and Kapoor received positive reviews for their performances. Film critic Taran Adarsh wrote that he \"has all it takes to emerge a competent actor in years to come. Even in his debut-making film, Abhishek comes across as a fine actor and lives up to his family name.\" After Refugee, Bachchan starred in a series of poorly received films that failed to make a mark at the box office. However, his performance in Sooraj R. Barjatya's romantic dramedy Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon (2003) earned him his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor, and he went on to win the award the following year for his performance in Mani Ratnam's political drama Yuva (2004). Bachchan better established himself in Hindi cinema playing a no-nonsense Mumbai police officer in the blockbuster action thriller Dhoom (2004), which also starred Uday Chopra, John Abraham, Esha Deol, and Rimi Sen in pivotal roles. His next two films were Phir Milenge (2004) and Naach (2004), neither of which performed very well at the box office. Bachchan's first release of 2005 was the crime comedy Bunty Aur Babli, which featured him and Rani Mukerji as the titular con artist duo who perform several successful heists and fall in love along the way. The film emerged as the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2005, and earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. This film also marked his first professional collaboration with his father Amitabh Bachchan, who played a police officer closely following the lead pair. Bachchan was next seen in Ram Gopal Varma's political drama Sarkar, which was a moderate success at the box office. His performance as the morally upright son of a troubled politician (played by his father Amitabh Bachchan) earned him rave reviews from critics as well as his second consecutive Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. His next two releases Dus (2005) and Bluffmaster! (2005) were both moderately successful, but did not earn much critical appreciation. Bachchan won his third consecutive Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Karan Johar's critically acclaimed romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), which emerged as a moderate commercial success despite the fact that it dealt with the controversial subject of marital infidelity. Bachchan played the role of a man whose wife (Rani Mukerji) is unhappy with their marriage, and so begins an affair with a friend (Shahrukh Khan) who is also unhappy with his marriage to his wife (Preity Zinta). Bachchan then starred opposite Aishwarya Rai in the period romance Umrao Jaan, a remake of the 1981 film of the same name starring Rekha and Farooq Sheikh in the lead roles. The film failed to earn the same level of appreciation as the original, and was also a commercial failure. He was next seen in Dhoom 2 (2006), which featured him and Uday Chopra reprising their roles from the original Dhoom (2004) joined by new cast members Hrithik Roshan, Aishwarya Rai, and Bipasha Basu. The film emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2006, but some critics commented that Bachchan was \"reduced to a mere supporting player\" to his co-star Roshan. Bachchan earned much critical acclaim for his performance in Mani Ratnam's Guru (2007), loosely based on the life of business magnate Dhirubhai Ambani.\" The film starred him alongside Aishwarya Rai Bachchan (their first professional collaboration after marriage), R. Madhavan, Mithun Chakraborty, Vidya Balan, and Arya Babbar. His next release was the dance comedy Jhoom Barabar Jhoom (2007) alongside Preity Zinta, Bobby Deol, and Lara Dutta. Although the film failed at the Indian box office, it was a moderate success overseas. He was then seen playing a minor role in the female-centric drama Laaga Chunari Mein Daag (2007) as the love interest of the film's lead actress Rani Mukerji. Bachchan's first release of 2008 was Ram Gopal Varma's Sarkar Raj, which featured him and his father Amitabh Bachchan reprising their roles from Sarkar (2005) while his wife Aishwarya Rai Bachchan entered the cast as a new addition. This film proved to be a major success at the box office, and earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. His next release was the fantasy adventure film Drona (2008), which was a major failure both critically and commercially. Bachchan was next seen in Dostana (2008), a romantic comedy about two men (Bachchan and John Abraham) who pretend to be gay in order to be allowed to live with a girl (Priyanka Chopra), but then find that they have both fallen in love with her. The film was a major success at the box office, and earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Bachchan's first release of 2009 was Delhi-6, which received a lukewarm response from critics. Later that year he was seen in the family dramedy Paa, which he also produced. The film's plot centered on a boy (Amitabh Bachchan) who suffers from progeria whose parents were played by Abhishek Bachchan and Vidya Balan. For his work as a producer on the film, Bachchan earned the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. Bachchan experienced a brief setback in his career with five films that failed critically and commercially. These films were the thriller Raavan (2010), the social drama Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey (2010), the action thriller Game (2011), the crime drama Dum Maaro Dum (2011), and the heist thriller Players (2012). Bachchan then played a supporting role alongside Ajay Devgan, Asin, and Prachi Desai in Rohit Shetty's comedy Bol Bachchan (2012), which was a major blockbuster at the box office despite receiving mixed reviews from critics. Film critic Anupama Chopra called Bachchan a \"good part of the film\" and also commented that he \"manages to sparkle even in a script that is lazy and determinedly lowbrow\". Bachchan received several comedian award for his role (Including Screen & IIFA). Bachchan then appeared in Dhoom 3 (2013), which featured him and Uday Chopra reprising their roles from the previous two Dhoom films. In this installment of the series, they were joined by Aamir Khan and Katrina Kaif. While the film became a major blockbuster, most critics commented that Bachchan's performance was overshadowed by Khan's. Bachchan was next seen in Farah Khan's blockbuster Happy New Year, a musical heist film which featured an ensemble cast of Shahrukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Sonu Sood, Boman Irani, Vivaan Shah and Jackie Shroff. Bachchan's performance in a double role earned him many positive reviews from critics, who called his performance a \"surprising standout\" and \"his loosest, funniest performance in years, if not ever.\" Both Dhoom 3 and Happy New Year rank among the highest-grossing Hindi films of all time. Bachchan was then seen in the 2015 family-drama All Is Well, which failed at the box office. Bachchan's first release of 2016 was the comedy Housefull 3, a sequel of the 2012 film Housefull 2. The film was successful at the box office.

The first leg covered the USA, Canada, Trinidad, and London.

        "biography": " Aishwarya Rai (born 1 November 1973), also known by her married name Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, is an Indian actress, model and the winner of the Miss World 1994 pageant. Through her successful acting career, she has established herself as one of the most popular and influential celebrities in India. Rai has received numerous awards and accolades, including two Filmfare Awards from eleven nominations, and she was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2009. She has often been called \"the most beautiful woman in the world\". While in college, Rai did a few modelling jobs. Following appearances in several television commercials, she entered the Miss India pageant, in which she placed second. She was then crowned Miss World 1994, after which she began receiving offers to act in film. She made her acting debut in Mani Ratnam's 1997 Tamil film Iruvar and had her first Hindi film release in Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya that same year. Her first commercial success was the Tamil romantic drama Jeans (1998), following which she achieved wider success and won two Best Actress awards at Filmfare for her performances in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999) and Devdas (2002). Rai garnered critical appreciation for portraying a passionate artist in the Tamil romance Kandukondain Kandukondain (2000), Tagore's heroine, Binodini, in the Bengali film Chokher Bali (2003), a depressed woman in the drama Raincoat (2004), Kiranjit Ahluwalia in the British drama film Provoked (2006), as a nurse in the drama Guzaarish (2010) and as a justise-seeking sister in the biographical drama Sarbjit (2015). Rai's greatest commercial successes have been the romance Mohabbatein (2000), the adventure film Dhoom 2 (2006), the historical romance Jodhaa Akbar (2008), the science fiction film Enthiran (2010), and the romantic drama Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016). Rai married actor Abhishek Bachchan in 2007 with whom she has one daughter. Her off-screen roles include duties as a brand ambassador for several charity organisations and campaigns. She is a Goodwill Ambassador for the Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS). In 2003, she was the first Indian actress to be a jury member at the Cannes Film Festival.   Rai was born into a Tulu-speaking Bunt family in Mangaluru, Karnataka. Her father, Krishnaraj who passed away on 18 March 2017, was an Army biologist, while her mother, Brinda, is a homemaker. She has one elder brother, Aditya Rai, who is an engineer in the merchant navy. Rai's movie Dil Ka Rishta (2003) was co-produced by her brother and co-written by her mother. The family moved to Mumbai, where Rai attended the Arya Vidya Mandir High School. Rai did her intermediate schooling at Jai Hind College for a year, and then joined DG Ruparel College in Matunga, securing 90 percent in the HSC exams. She trained in classical dance and music for five years during her teens. Her favourite subject was zoology, so she initially considered a career in medicine. Then with plans to become an architect, she enrolled at Rachana Sansad Academy of Architecture, but later gave up her education to pursue a career in modelling. In 1991, Rai won an international supermodel contest (organised by Ford) and was eventually featured in the American edition of Vogue. In 1993, Rai gained huge public recognition for her appearance in a Pepsi commercial with actors Aamir Khan and Mahima Chaudhry. The single line \u2013 \"Hi, I'm Sanjana,\" of her dialogue in the commercial made her instantly famous. In the 1994 Miss India pageant, she won second place, behind Sushmita Sen, and was crowned Miss India World, also winning five other sub-titles, including \"Miss Catwalk\", \"Miss Miraculous\", \"Miss Photogenic\", \"Miss Perfect Ten\" and \"Miss Popular\". With Sen representing India at the Miss Universe pageant, Rai's duties as the first runner-up included representing India in the rival Miss World Pageant, held that year in Sun City, South Africa. She went on to win the crown where she also won the \"Miss Photogenic\" award and Miss World Continental Queen of Beauty \u2212 Asia and Oceania. After winning the pageant, Rai spoke of her dream for peace for this world, and her desire to be an ambassador of peace during her one-year reign in London. Rai continued to pursue a career as a model until she became an actress. Rai made her acting debut in 1997 with Mani Ratnam's Tamil film Iruvar, a semi-biographical political drama, featuring Mohanlal, Prakash Raj, Tabu and Revathi. The film was a critical success and among other awards, won the Best Film award at the Belgrade International Film Festival Rai featured as Pushpavalli and Kalpana \u2013 dual roles; the latter was a fictionalised portrayal of politician and former actress Jayalalithaa. Due to Rai's weak Tamil-speaking skills, her dialogue in the film was dubbed by Tamil actress Rohini. That same year, she was cast as Ashi, a naive teenager in her first Bollywood film \u2013 Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya, a romantic comedy opposite Bobby Deol. Both Iruvar and Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya were commercial failures and reviewers were critical of Rai's acting ability in both the films. However, for the latter, she won a Screen Award for Best Female Debut. In the 1998 big-budget Tamil romantic drama Jeans directed by S. Shankar, Rai appeared alongside Prashanth and Nassar. She played Madhumita, a young woman who accompanies her ailing grandmother to the United States to seek medical attention. A commercial success, the film earned Rai praise for her acting and dancing skills. Unlike in Iruvar, Rai practised and dubbed for her own lines in the film. Jeans was later submitted as India's official entry to the Academy Awards for 1998. Her first role in 1999 was in the melodrama Aa Ab Laut Chalen, directed by Rishi Kapoor. The film was a critical failure and had a below average performance at the box office. Rai's portrayal of Pooja Walia, a traditional Indian woman living in the United States, met with negative reviews; Rediff.com published, \"Aishwarya Rai sports a plastic smile and never gets a scene where she can portray any depth. All she does is cry and smile and look pretty\". In 1999, Rai starred in the romantic drama Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam which became a significant turning point in her career. The film, an adaptation of Maitreyi Devi's Bengali novel Na Hanyate, was directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and co-starred Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan. She played the main protagonist Nandini, a Gujarati woman who is forced into wedlock (with Devgan's character) despite being in love with another man (played by Khan). Bhansali cast Rai after he met her at the screening of a film and was impressed with her eyes. TheMovieReport.com praised Rai's performance over her co-actors and noted, \"Rai, in a luminous, award-winning performance (largely considered her big dramatic breakthrough\u2014and justifiably so), fills in the conflicted emotional shades that Khan fails to bring with his one-dimensional presence\". Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam emerged as a major commercial success and won Rai a Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Rai next took the leading role of Mansi, an aspiring singer, in Subhash Ghai's musical Taal; alongside Akshay Khanna, Anil Kapoor, Amrish Puri and Alok Nath. A reviewer for Rediff praised her acting and dancing prowess in it and wrote that \"Taal will again enhance her reputation as an actress while in no way detracting from her image as a traffic-stopper\". A moderate domestic success, Taal was notable for being the first Indian film to feature in the top twenty listing at the American box-office. Rai received a second Best Actress nomination that year at the Filmfare Awards ceremony. In 2000, Rai starred in Kandukondain Kandukondain, a Tamil language adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Sense and Sensibility. Directed by Rajiv Menon, the film also starred Tabu, Mammooty and Ajith Kumar in prominent roles. Rai was cast as Meenakshi (based on the character of Marianne Dashwood), the younger sister of Tabu's character. The film was a critical and commercial success and earned Rai positive comments from critics; a review carried by The Indian Express summarised, \"Attacking her role with just the perfect dollop of innocence, Aishwarya does full justice to her part, and matches up perfectly to Tabu.\" Rai next starred alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Chandrachur Singh in the action drama Josh. She portrayed Shirley Dias, the twin sister of Khan's character who falls in love with his arch enemy's brother (played by Singh). The casting of Rai as Khan's sister was considered an unusual pairing at the time; director Mansoor Khan, however, described it as \"perfect\". Despite earning mixed reviews from film critics, Josh emerged as a commercial success. Satish Kaushik's social drama Hamara Dil Aapke Paas Hai was Rai's next release; she played a rape victim in the film. Co-starring Anil Kapoor and Sonali Bendre, the film was well received by critics and did moderate business at the box office. Film critic Sukanya Verma praised Rai's decision to star in the film and added that she \"conveys the turmoil and pain of a rape victim well. But it is her transition from an emotional wreck trying to gather the broken pieces of her life back together that is amazing.\" Rai eventually earned a third Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. Following a leading role in the box-office flop Dhai Akshar Prem Ke, Rai took on a supporting role in Aditya Chopra's ensemble romance Mohabbatein. Rai's role was that of Megha Shankar, the daughter of Amitabh Bachchan's character who commits suicide after realising that her father will not accept her romance with one of his students (played by Shah Rukh Khan). Despite earning mixed reviews from film critics, Mohabbatein emerged as the second highest-grossing film of the year and earned Rai a Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination. The following year, she starred alongside Govinda and Jackie Shroff in the romantic comedy Albela. Upon release, both the film and her performance received mostly negative reviews; Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama criticised the film and mentioned Rai as \"plastic in some scenes\". After featuring in David Dhawan's slapstick comedy film Hum Kisise Kum Nahin, Rai appeared alongside Shahrukh Khan and Madhuri Dixit in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's love-saga Devdas, an adaptation of Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel of the same name. She played the role of Paro (Parvati), the love interest of the protagonist (played by Khan). The film was screened at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and was featured by Time in their listing of the \"10 best films of the millennium\". The film emerged as a major international success with revenues of over \u20b9840 million (US$13\u00a0million). Alan Morrison, writing for Empire, praised the performances of the three leads and wrote, \"Aishwarya Rai proves she has the acting talent to back up her flawless looks\". Devdas was chosen as India's official entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and received a nomination at the BAFTA Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category. In India, the film won 10 Filmfare Awards, including a second Best Actress award for Rai. In 2003, Rai featured in two romantic dramas of Bollywood, her brother's production d\u00e9but Dil Ka Rishta, alongside Arjun Rampal, and Rohan Sippy's Kuch Na Kaho, alongside Abhishek Bachchan. Neither of these films fared well critically or commercially. She was later noted for her starring role in Rituparno Ghosh's independent Bengali film Chokher Bali, an adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore's novel of the same name. She portrayed the character of Binodini, an emotionally manipulative widow, struggling with her sexual desires in early-20th century Bengal. The film was a major critical success and Rai earned positive notice for her performance; Derek Elley of Variety noted, \"Rai dominates the film with her delicately sensual presence and physical grace\". Commercially, the film was a sleeper hit. After the success of Chokher Bali, Rai returned to mainstream Hindi film with Rajkumar Santoshi's Khakee (2004), an action thriller featuring Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgan and Tusshar Kapoor. The film tells the story of five constables embroiled in a mystery surrounding a terrorist attack; Rai's role was that of Mahalakshmi, a gun moll. While filming for Khakee, Rai was accidentally hit by a running car, which resulted in the fracture of her left foot. Upon release, the film received moderate critical and commercial success. In her next release, the romantic comedy Kyun! Ho Gaya Na..., Rai played Diya Malhotra, a university student who develops a one-sided attraction toward her friend Arjun Khanna (played by Vivek Oberoi). The film received positive to mixed comments from critics, but failed commercially. In late 2004, Rai garnered international recognition for her starring role opposite Martin Henderson in Gurinder Chadha's British film Bride and Prejudice, a Bollywood-style adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice. International film critics expressed mixed views on Rai's performance as the Punjabi version of Elizabeth Bennet; a review carried by The New York Times mentioned her as \"radiantly beautiful but inert\", while Rolling Stone noted that \"she is a world-class hottie with talent to match, as she proves in her first English-speaking role\". With a worldwide gross of $24 million against a production budget of $7 million, Bride and Prejudice proved a commercial success. Rai next collaborated with director Rituparno Ghosh, for the second time, in the relationship drama Raincoat, an adaptation of O. Henry's The Gift of the Magi. Also featuring Ajay Devgan, Raincoat met with wide critical acclaim and among other wins, won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. The Hindu noted, \"[A]s Neerja, [Rai] appears to have shed her inhibitions about looking unglamorous. What is more, she seems to have made an earnest effort to emote, using less of her body and limbs and more of her face, and eyes in particular\". She eventually received another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. Rai next co-starred alongside Sanjay Dutt and Zayed Khan in the 2005 adult drama Shabd, which tells the story of an author who convinces his wife to pursue an illicit relationship with a younger man in research for his next book. The film received predominantly negative reviews and proved a commercial failure. The Times of India concluded, \"For the umpteenth time, Ms Rai looks drop-dead gorgeous. And that's about it. She is like that picture postcard you get when what you were actually waiting for is a letter. It's very beautiful to look at, but is of no use because it says nothing.\" That same year, Rai took on the lead role of Tilo in Paul Mayeda Berges's romantic fantasy film The Mistress of Spices, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. The film received negative reviews from film critics and emerged as a commercial failure.[not in citation given] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian termed Rai's performance as \"annoying\" and wrote that she \"wafts and simpers\" through the entire film. Rai's only successful venture of 2005 was a special appearance in Shaad Ali's comedy Bunty Aur Babli, in which she featured in the popular item number Kajra Re. Rai had two film releases in 2006, J P Dutta's Umrao Jaan and Yash Raj Films' Dhoom 2. The former, an adaptation of Mirza Hadi Ruswa's Urdu novel Umrao Jaan Ada (1905), tells the story of a doomed courtesan from 19th-century Lucknow. Rai played the titular role, a character famously played by Rekha in the first film adaptation of the novel. Reviewers, while comparing the film to its previous adaptation, were critical of the film as well as of Rai's performance. BBC noted, \"While only Aishwarya could emulate the grace and poise of Rekha, she doesn't quite capture the intensity of Umrao's abiding melancholy\", adding that \"Rai's incandescent beauty and artistry [..] does indeed keep the audience watching, though not necessarily emotionally engaged.\" In the Sanjay Gadhvi-directed adventure film Dhoom 2, Rai portrayed Sunehri, a petty thief who helps the police catch an illusive criminal; the film had an ensemble cast including Hrithik Roshan, Abhishek Bachchan, Bipasha Basu, and Uday Chopra. Though critically unsuccessful, the film was Rai's first major commercial success since Devdas; the film was declared a blockbuster, and became the highest grossing Indian film of 2006 with gross revenues of over \u20b91.11 billion (US$17\u00a0million). Rediff.com commented, \"[She] is all gloss and no depth. You seldom feel any tension in her behaviour and expressions. [..] Sunehri enters the film nearly 50 minutes after its opening in a disguise. In no time, she is wearing the flimsiest of clothes. Once she opens her mouth\u2014and she does it two minutes after appearing in the film\u2014she spoils the image.\" Nonetheless, her performance earned her a sixth Filmfare Award nomination in the Best Actress category. In 2007, Rai played the wife of Abhishek Bachchan's character in Mani Ratnam's social drama Guru. A fictionalised biography of businessman Dhirubhai Ambani, Guru tells the rag to riches story of an uneducated man who builds a multinational corporation. The film met with international critical acclaim and emerged as a box-office success. Richard Corliss of Time labelled her character as an \"ornament\", but Raja Sen from Rediff described it as \"arguably her finest performance, visible especially when she takes over the film's climax.\" Rai received her seventh Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her performance in the film. Rai next starred alongside Naveen Andrews and Miranda Richardson in Jag Mundhra's independent British drama Provoked, as the real-life character of Kiranjit Ahluwalia, a non-resident Indian who murders her husband after suffering years of domestic abuse. Rai earned mostly positive comments for her performance. Critic Indu Mirani from DNA wrote, \"Aishwarya Rai plays the battered wife in what is undoubtedly one of her best performances to date. Rai convincingly goes through the various stages of shock, bewilderment, remorse and finally vindication\". Internationally well-received, the film emerged as a moderate commercial success in the United Kingdom. That same year, Rai starred alongside Ben Kingsley, Colin Firth and Thomas Sangster as the Indian warrior Mira in Doug Lefler's epic film The Last Legion. After a series of films that under-performed either critically or commercially, Rai garnered both critical and box-office success with Ashutosh Gowariker's period romance Jodhaa Akbar (2008). The film narrates a partly fictionalised account of a marriage of convenience between the Mughal emperor Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar (played by Hrithik Roshan) and the Rajput princess Jodha Bai (played by Rai). Rajeev Masand noted, \"Aishwarya Rai is wonderfully restrained and uses her eyes expertly to communicate so much, making this one of her finest outings on screen\". The film had gross earnings of \u20b91.12 billion (US$17\u00a0million) and fetched Rai a Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards ceremony. She then co-starred with her husband, Abhishek Bachchan, and her father-in-law, Amitabh Bachchan, in Ram Gopal Verma's political drama Sarkar Raj, a sequel to the 2005 box-office hit Sarkar. Rai was cast as Anita Rajan, the CEO of an international power firm who proposes to set up a plant in rural Maharashtra. The film was a critical and commercial success, with praise directed to the performances of the three leads.[not in citation given] Rai's next role was in the 2009 Harald Zwart-directed spy comedy The Pink Panther 2. Starring alongside Steve Martin, Jean Reno and Emily Mortimer, Rai portrayed the role of Sonia Solandres, a seductive criminology expert. Like its predecessor, the sequel received negative reviews from critics, but did a moderate business of $34 million at the American box office. Roger Ebert wrote, \"Rai is breathtaking in Bollywood films, where they devote a great deal of expertise to admiring beauty, but here she's underutilized and too much in the background\"; USA Today mentioned her expressions as \"wooden\" and added, \"She looks gorgeous, but her expression rarely changes\". In 2010, Rai was cast by Mani Ratnam in his bilingual modern-day adaptation of the Indian epic Ramayana. Her role was that of Ragini (modeled on Sita, the heroine of Ramayana), a woman married to the superintendent of police, who is kidnapped by a bandit. The Hindi version (Raavan) and the Tamil version (Raavanan) of the film were shot simultaneously and Rai played the same role in both the film versions. The films received polarising reviews from film critics, as did Rai's performance. Kaveree Bamzai of India Today wrote, \"Aishwarya's Sita is one of the best things in the film ... her performance is heartfelt\u2014this is a performer who is at ease playing women, rather than girls\". However, film critics Aniruddha Guha and Rajeev Masand criticised her character and noted, \"She's left to scream and shriek and hiss.\" Commercially, Raavanan emerged as a success while Raavan flopped. Rai's next role was opposite Rajinikanth in the science fiction Tamil film Enthiran (2010), directed by S. Shankar. She was cast as Sana, a college student and the girlfriend of Rajinikanth's character. At the time of release, Enthiran was the most expensive Indian film production and eventually emerged as one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. She then appeared as Mala, an impetuous brat, in Vipul Shah's Action Replayy; a science fiction comedy co-starring Akshay Kumar, Aditya Roy Kapoor and Neha Dhupia. Rai's final film of 2010 was the drama Guzaarish; her third collaboration with director Sanjay Leela Bhansali and actor Hrithik Roshan. The film tells the story of Ethan Mascarenas, a former magician (played by Roshan) suffering from quadriplegia, who after years of struggle, files an appeal for euthanasia. Rai's role was that of Sophia D'Souza, Mascarenas' nurse, who is abused by her alcoholic husband. Due to her and Bhansali's prior associations, Rai agreed to the project before reading its script. Despite flopping at the box-office, Guzaarish met with positive critical comments. The Telegragh described it to be \"one of Aishwarya Rai\u2019s best performances\" and The Times of India summarised, \"Aishwarya is a stunning picture of fire and grace, walking away with certain scenes by her sheer vitality.\" In 2011, Rai was cast as the protagonist of Madhur Bhandarkar's social drama Heroine; however, due to her pregnancy, Rai was replaced by actress Kareena Kapoor, the original choice for the role. After a five-year sabbatical from film acting, Rai made a comeback with Sanjay Gupta's drama-thriller Jazbaa, co-starring Shabana Azmi and Irrfan Khan. A remake of the Korean thriller Seven Days (2007), the film saw Rai play the role of Anuradha Verma, a criminal lawyer who is forced to defend a rapist in exchange for her daughter's safety. The film received mixed reviews from critics but turned out to be a profitable venture at box-office. Shomini Sen from CNN-IBN writing, \"Jazbaa scores only because of the performances. Aishwarya Rai grunts and screeches on some scenes but manages to deliver a convincing performance.\" In 2016, Rai starred in Omung Kumar's biographical drama Sarbjit. The film is based on the life of Indian farmer Sarabjit Singh, who was convicted of terrorism by a Pakistani court, and how his sister Dalbir Kaur fought relentlessly for his release. Rai played the role of the sister of Sarabjit Singh (played by Randeep Hooda). The film premiered at the 69th Cannes Film Festival, and received mixed reactions from critics. Few reviewers expressed that Rai was \"miscast\" as she neither looked nor sounded like a Sikh woman. Her Punjabi accent and her over-the-top performance in few scenes was largely criticized, though several critics took note of how much she stood out in the film's quieter scenes. Rajeev Masand summarised that \"she's required to scream and shout and weep copiously to express her anguish; the shrillness does her no favors. In quieter moments \u2013 like one in which Dalbir can't bear to part with her stillborn baby \u2013 the actress shines.\" Nonetheless her role earned her tenth Filmfare Best Actress nomination. The film underperformed at the box-office. Rai's final release of 2016 was Karan Johar's romantic drama Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, alongside Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma in which she played the role of a poetess named Saba. Rai received mostly positive notice for her performance despite having limited screen time. Nihit Bhav of Indiatimes wrote that \"seeing [Rai] in the role of a confident seductress is a welcome change\". The film emerged as a major commercial success with revenues of over \u20b92 billion (US$31\u00a0million). Rai made her first commercial for Camlin exam pencils when she was in the 9th grade. Rai became popular after appearing in a Pepsi commercial with actor Aamir Khan. She is the only actress who endorsed both Pepsi and Coca-Cola. She is one of the top brand ambassadors in the country and is one of the top paid Bollywood actresses in this respect. She modelled for Titan Watches, Longines watches, L'Or\u00e9al, Coca-Cola, Lakm\u00e9 Cosmetics, Casio pager, Philips, Palmolive, Lux, Fuji films, Nakshatra Diamond Jewellery, and Kalyan Jewellers. She was named the official brand ambassador for De Beers diamonds in India. Rai has been ranked the 2nd most popular watch brand ambassador worldwide in a survey, conducted by World Watch Report. In 2013 Rai and her husband Abhishek Bachchan have been roped in as the brand ambassadors by the TTK Group. Rai endorses Lodha\u2019s Worli project by Lodha Group World One.

Rai is the brand ambassador for The Eye Bank Association of India's nationwide campaign to promote eye donation in India. In 2005, she became a brand ambassador for Pulse Polio, a campaign established by the Government of India in 1994 to eradicate polio in India. In the same year, Rai was appointed spokesperson for the International Year of Microcredit, raising awareness of the main goals and priorities of the United Nations' poverty alleviation efforts. In February 2005 Rai performed with other Bollywood stars at the HELP! Telethon Concert, an event to raise money for the victims of the 2004 tsunami earthquake. Along with other members of the Bachchan family, she laid the foundation of a special school for underprivileged girls in Daulatpur village in Uttar Pradesh in 2008. Construction is being funded by the Bachchan family and the school will be named after Rai. She appeared along with various other Bollywood actors at the closing ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. The performance showcased Indian culture as a lead-up to India hosting the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Rai is a UN Microcredit Spokesperson. She supports PETA India. She pledged to donate her eyes to the Eye Bank Association of India and appeared in a public awareness film on eye donation. In November 2004, Rai created the Aishwarya Rai Foundation to help needy people in India. In 2009 Rai was appointed as the first Goodwill Ambassador of Smile Train, an international charity that provides free Cleft lip and palate surgery to children in need. Her work with Smile Train will focus not only on India, but on 76 different developing countries around the world. In September 2012, Rai had joined United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and renowned Hollywood actor Michael Douglas at a ceremony to commemorate the International Day of Peace in New York. Later that week, she was appointed as the new international Goodwill Ambassador for UNAIDS, the joint United Nations programme on AIDS and HIV. She will raise global awareness on protecting children from HIV infection and increasing access to antiretroviral treatment. Rai has taken part in several stage shows and world tours since 2001. Her first world tour, a series of concerts called Craze 2001, was performed across the US alongside Anil Kapoor, Aamir Khan, Preity Zinta and Gracy Singh. The show faced early cancellation due to the 11 September 2001 attacks, and the team prepared to return to India as soon as possible. However, the shows continued successfully in Canada. In 2002, she participated in the show From India With Love in the UK, along with Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta. It took place at two outdoor venues, Manchester's Old Trafford and London's Hyde Park, with over 100,000\u00a0spectators. Between July to August 2008, Rai, her husband Abhishek Bachchan, her father-in-law Amitabh Bachchan, and actors Preity Zinta, Ritesh Deshmukh and Madhuri Dixit starred in the \"Unforgettable World Tour\" stage production. The first leg covered the USA, Canada, Trinidad, and London, England. Rai is also involved in the functional and administrative operations of her father-in-law's company, originally known as ABCL, and rechristened as AB Corp. Ltd. That company, along with Wizcraft International Entertainment Pvt. Ltd., developed the Unforgettable production. In 1999, Rai began dating Bollywood actor Salman Khan; their relationship was often reported in the media until the couple separated in 2002. Rai cited \"abuse (verbal, physical and emotional), infidelity and indignity\" on the part of Khan as reasons for ending the relationship. Though they both appeared in Dhai Akshar Prem Ke (in which her then longtime boyfriend, Salman Khan, had a brief cameo) and Kuch Naa Kaho, Abhishek Bachchan fell in love with Rai whilst filming Dhoom 2. Their engagement was announced on 14 January 2007 and later confirmed by his father, Amitabh Bachchan. The couple married on 20 April 2007 according to traditional Hindu rites of the Bunt community, to which she belongs. Token North Indian and Bengali ceremonies were also performed. The wedding took place in a private ceremony at the Bachchan residence, \"Prateeksha\", in Juhu, Mumbai. They have been described as a supercouple in the Indian media. Rai is very close to her family and lived with them in Bandra, Mumbai, until her marriage. Rai is Hindu and deeply religious. Her international presence shot up when Abhishek Bachchan accompanied her to the Cannes Film Festival shortly after their marriage, and later to The Oprah Winfrey Show, appearing on 28 September 2009. They were described as being more famous as a couple than Brangelina. Rai gave birth to a baby girl on 16 November 2011. Her daughter became popularly known by the name of \"Beti B\", a name attributed to her by fans and the media, since the couple took over four months to name their daughter. Rai is commonly referred to by fans and the media by the nicknames \"Ash\" and \"Aish\", but has stated that she dislikes being called as such. She has discouraged people from referring to her by names other than \"Aishwarya\" as she does not want to \"spoil [her] good name\". Rai Bachchan is one of the most popular Bollywood celebrities in the world. Despite constant media speculation, she keeps her personal life well-guarded. Her beauty and performances have made her as a style icon for young women. Over 17,000 websites dedicated to her, she was selected by Verve magazine in its list of the country's most powerful women. In 2001 Forbes named Rai among the top five Indian movie stars. In a reader poll conducted by UK's Hello! magazine, she was voted \"the most attractive woman of 2003\". In the same year, Rai appeared in Rolling Stone magazine's annual \"Hot List\". In 2004, she was chosen by TIME magazine as one of the world's most influential people, and appeared on the cover of its 2003 Asia edition. Rai has earned the distinction of being the first Indian actress to be on the jury of the Cannes International Film Festival In October 2004 a wax figure of Rai was put on display in London's Madame Tussaud's wax museum. She was the sixth Indian and the second Bollywood personality\u2014after her father-in-law, Amitabh Bachchan\u2014to get this honour. In 2007 the same figure was displayed at Madame Tussaud's Museum in Times Square in New York. As her most distinctive physical features, Rai's green-blue eyes, luscious lips, sexy curves and ultra-feminine mannerisms have been cited by the media as her trademark. In 2005, she was the subject of a 60 Minutes profile on 2 January, which said that \"at least according to thousands of Web sites, Internet polls and even Julia Roberts\", she was \"the world's most beautiful woman\". The same year, a tulip in the Netherlands was named \"Aishwarya Rai\" after her. Also in 2005, Mattel released a limited edition of Barbie dolls of Rai in the United Kingdom.

However, she silenced her critics by walking the red carpet at the \"AmfAR Cinema Against Aids\" gala in 2012 Cannes Film Festival for the 11th time. Later that year, Rai has made it to the issue of New York Magazine\u2019s list of \"Forty Women That Women Find Beautiful\", where she grabbed the 21st position in the list, with New York Magazine saying \"She may be the \"world\u2019s most beautiful woman,\" but what we really love is that she never feels fragile onscreen,\".

However, the film was not popular with the public. Mahesh Manjrekar's Tera Mera Saath Rahen followed. In 2002, Devgan performed in Ram Gopal Varma's fictional examination of the Mumbai underworld in the film Company. Devgan played a gangster named Malik. Both Company and Devgan's performance received critical acclaim. Taran Adarsh reviewed, \"Ajay Devgn enacts his role to perfection. A controlled performance, the actor takes to this complex character like a fish takes to water. He underplays his part with admirable ease.\" Devgan was nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award and won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Devgan's next release was David Dhawan's comedy Hum Kisise Kum Nahin, with Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt and Aishwarya Rai. The same year, he played the role of Bhagat Singh, in Rajkumar Santoshi's biopic The Legend of Bhagat Singh. His performance was well received by critics. Taran Adarsh said, \"Ajay Devgn has lived the role. To state that he is excellent would be an understatement. His performance is bound to win admiration from cinegoers, besides fetching awards.\" The film was released on 7 June 2002 and went on to win two National Film Awards, including the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi, and three Filmfare Awards, including the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie. Despite these awards, and Devgan winning his second National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance, the film was not popular with the public.

Devgan's next release of the year was Prakash Jha's Gangaajal. The film was set in the time of the blinding incident in Bhagalpur, Bihar. Rediff.com said, \"Ajay Devgan pulls up an ace with a part tailormade to reinforce his seething-under-the-surface angry hero image. To his credit (and the director's), he brings style and grace to a largely stereotypical, righteous protagonist. To a great extent, his presence covers up the film's patchiness in the second half.\" Devgan was nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for this performance. He then worked in Rohit Shetty's directional debut Zameen and J. P. Dutta's war film LOC Kargil. In 2004, Devgan was cast with Amitabh Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai and Akshay Kumar in Rajkumar Santoshi's action thriller Khakee. The film was released on 23 January 2004.

His performance as a police officer turned murderer was well received by critics.

His confrontations with Amitabh Bachchan are exemplary.\" Later in 2004, Devgan appeared in Indra Kumar's Masti: Sanam Teri Kasam. He also starred in Yuva. Devgan next collaborated with Rituparno Ghosh in the relationship drama Raincoat with Aishwaraya Rai. The film is an adaptation of O. Henry's The Gift of the Magi. Raincoat met with wide critical acclaim and won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. Devgan was praised for his performance. Rediff said, \"Hesitation, desperation, humiliation \u2013 Ajay Devgn conveys them eloquently. His Manoj is no cool dude, but just another lower middle-class guy in misery, with whom none would like to switch place. He particularly stands out in the scenes where he cries in the bathroom, or begs Neeru not to marry someone else.\" In 2004, Devgan was also seen in a cameo appearance in Taarzan: The Wonder Car. 2005 was a less successful year for Devgan. His movies were not financially successful. They included Insan, Blackmail, Main Aisa Hi Hoon, Tango Charlie and Shikhar. However, the films Kaal and Apaharan did well. For his performance in Apaharan, Devgn was nominated for the National Film Award for Best Actor and the Filmfare Best Actor Award. His performance as a villain in Kaal also earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Best Villain Award. In 2006 Devgan played Othello in Omkara, an Hindi adaptation of William Shakespeare's Othello. It was directed by Vishal Bhardwaj. The film is a tragedy of sexual jealousy set against the backdrop of the political system in Uttar Pradesh. It premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and was screened at the Cairo International Film Festival. Omkara was well received by critics. Rediff said, \"Othello is a tricky role, a leading man eclipsed by the villain. Yet the Moor is a brooding and compelling character, and Ajay Devgn does valiantly with his material. Omkara strips Othello of the racism, exchanging his black skin for surprisingly inconsequential half-Brahminism. Ajay's best bits are when restrained, and while there is a bit of a seen-that feel to his character, by the time the film is over, you realise just how unflinchingly solid he's been.\" Taran Adarsh said, \"Ajay makes a stirring and powerful interpretation of a man haunted by uncertainty about his lover's faithfulness. The serious look that Ajay carries suits him to the T. Of course, Ajay is exceptional in the film and looks every inch the character he portrays.\" In 2006, Devgan also starred in Rohit Shetty's Golmaal. It had two sequels Golmaal Returns and Golmaal 3. In the same year, Devgan was featured in a short documentary about the Mumbai floods of 2005 titled The Awakening. In 2007 Devgan starred in two movies, director Anubhav Sinha's action thriller Cash and Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag. In 2008, Devgan performed in the social film Halla Bol, directed by Rajkumar Santoshi.

In 2008, Devgan also performed in Rohit Shetty's third film Sunday. He then took the lead role with Kajol in his own directorial debut film, U Me Aur Hum. The film performed moderately well at the box-office and earned positive critical reviews for his performance as well as for his direction. Rediff said, \"His character grows, discovers both shirt-buttons and subtlety, delivering an intense acting job. Speaking almost entirely in platitudes \u2013 pithy at first, profound as he goes on \u2013 this grows into an extraordinarily well-written character, replete with flaws and relatability. The way he treats his remorse, drunkenly pointing every finger at himself around a dinner table, is superbly handled, as is his guilty struggle to delineate his life experience from his professional opinion.\" Devgan also made a cameo appearance in his brother Anil Devgan's film Haal\u2013e\u2013dil. He then starred in Afzal Khan's Mehbooba. Again in 2008, Devgan performed in Rohit Shetty's comedy Golmaal Returns, a sequel to the 2006 film Golmaal: Fun Unlimited about a mistrustful wife who believed her husband was unfaithful. The Indian Express said the screenplay was derivative, concluding, \"There is nothing particularly new about a suspicious wife keeping tabs on her husband, and there is nothing particularly new in the way Ajay-Kareena play it.\" Golmaal Returns was a financial success with global revenues of \u20b979.25 crore (US$12\u00a0million). In 2009, Devgan produced his third film, All the Best, directed by Rohit Shetty. It had some financial success.

There were also issues about the use of the national anthem in the film. The film was made with a budget of \u20b960 crore (US$9.3\u00a0million) When the film was released, it had positive reviews and was financially successful. Again, in 2010, Devgan starred in Milan Luthria's Once Upon a Time in Mumbai which was among the top-grossing films of that year. Both the film and Devgan's performance were well received by the critics. Taran Adarsh said, \"Ajay Devgn is splendid as Sultan. The actor had enacted a similar role in Company, but it must be said that his interpretation is so different in Once Upon A Time in Mumbaai. He adds so much depth to the character, which only goes to prove his range and versatility. This is, without a trace of doubt, Ajay's finest work so far.\" Komal Nahta said, \"Ajay Devgn is simply fantastic in the role of Sultan Mirza. So real is his performance that it looks like he was born to play this role. Right from his look to his acting including dialogue-delivery, everything is fabulous. Indeed, an award-winning performance!\" Devgan then starred in Priyadarshan's action-thriller film, Aakrosh. The movie explores the subject of honour killings. Aakrosh received some positive reviews but financially unsuccessful. At the end of 2010, Devgan worked again with Rohit Shetty in Golmaal 3, a sequel to Golmaal Returns (2008).

He was a narrator in Yamla Pagla Deewana and also made a cameo appearance in Ready. Devgan starred in Rohit Shetty's Singham. Taran Adarsh said, \"The title means 'Lion' and Ajay is in the centre of the battle between good and evil. Ajay is well known for the lines, \"aataa maajhi satakli\". The embodiment of screen masculinity, Ajay enacts the central character of a righteous, hardhearted cop with flourish. He brings alive on screen a larger-than-life hero character with determined conviction, which renders you thunderstruck. One of the few actors who underplays his part admirably, he returns to the over-the-top-action genre of films with this one. In a nutshell, his performance plays a pivotal role in carrying the film to the winning post.\" He then starred David Dhawan's action comedy film Rascals. In 2012, Devgan starred in Tezz, directed by Priyadarshan. His co-stars were Anil Kapoor, Boman Irani, Kangana Ranaut, Sameera Reddy and Zayed Khan.

Collection over \u20b932.09 crore (US$5.0\u00a0million) on the first day of its release in India. Domestic nett of Singham Returns are \u20b9140.62 crore (US$22\u00a0million).

        "artist_name": "Ajit_Khan", 
        "biography": " Hamid Ali Khan (27 January 1922 \u2013 21 October 1998), better known by his stage name Ajit, was a prolific Hindi film actor. He acted in over two hundred movies in almost four decades. Ajit is also credited for starring as a lead actor in popular Bollywood movies such as Nastik, Bada Bhai, Milan, Bara-Dari, and later as a second lead in Mughal-e-Azam and Naya Daur.   Born Hamid Ali Khan, near the historic place Golconda, Hyderabad, Ajit had his early education in Warangal, studied in Govt. Junior College, Hanamkonda, Warangal district of Telangana. Hamid was the son of Bashir Ali Khan, who was in the Nizam's army, and had a younger brother, Wahid Ali Khan and 2 sisters. Hamid entered the film industry to become a hero and did quite a few creditable films as lead artiste in Nastik, Bada Bhai, Milan, Baradari, Dholak and later as a second lead in Mughal-e-Azam and Naya Daur. Film director K. Amarnath, who directed him in Bekasoor, suggested that the actor change his long name of Hamid Ali Khan to something shorter, and Hamid zeroed in on \"Ajit\". Ajit, who ran away from home to Mumbai after selling his college books, started his career in films in the 1940s. Luck did not favour him in the initial stages. He began with the 1946 movie Shahe Misra, acting opposite Geeta Bose, and also did films such as Sikander (van mala), Hatimtai (1947), Aap Beeti (Khursheed), Sone Ki Chidiya (Leela Kumari), Dholak (Meena Shori) and Chanda Ki Chandni (Monica Desai) as leading hero, but flopped. He did most of films (15) with Nalini Jaywant. Ajit switched over to play the villain. His first movie as a villain was Suraj, followed by films such as Zanjeer and Yaadon Ki Baaraat. His famous dialogues included the 'Mona darling' bit inYaadon Ki Baraat, 'Lily don't be silly' in Zanjeer and the ones about a 'Lion' in Kallicharan. Ajit's other well known films were Naya Daur, Nastik and Shikari to name only a few. In his four decades of film career, Ajit had acted along with the legendary Prithvi Raj Kapoor, Sohrab Modi, Amitabh Bachchan, I S Johar, Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand, Shami Kapoor, Dharmendra and many actress, both young and old.  In the mid-seventies he had acted in over 57 films, mostly as a villain. His dialogue delivery remains popular even to this date. His colleagues in the film industry \u2014leading personalities who have acted with him, grown seeing him in Mumbai \u2014 have expressed deep sorrow over the death of the legendary actor. Writer Javed Akhtar, who scripted Zanjeer, said: \"Like Bachchan, Ajit found a new image as villain after Zanjeer. He started a new innings in his career though he was an established hero in the fifties. His villainy started a new trend. Here was a new villain who was soft-spoken yet forceful. We wanted to give a different image to villainy which matched the hero.\" He is survived by two sons-Shehzad Khan and Arbaaz Ali Khan. Another \"villain\" Amrish Puri said Ajit's death is a sad loss to films. \"Ajit developed his own style of acting and delivery of dialogue. We still remember his style of acting which is guidance to the new generation of actors.\" Prem Chopra, who starred with Ajit in many films including Jugnu, Chupa Rustom and Ram Balram as a father and son team, said Ajit was devoted in his work. \"He had a subtle sense of humour. He was a cultured man. We had a common interest -- reciting Urdu shairi.\" New-generation villain Kiran Kumar was shocked to hear that \"his Ajit uncle\" had died. \"Our relationship was more personal than professional. I must have been hardly eight or ten years when my father (veteran character actor Jeevan) used to take me to Paradise Bakery opposite which was Ajit's residence. Father would call him by his first name Hamid, and would call him down. Ajit would come down, wearing lungi and jaali banian to chat with my father.\" Ajit almost always portrayed the sophisticated, educated, well groomed evil mastermind, albeit heartless villain. Ajit was presented in striking western attire, the \"bold\" checked suits, matching overcoats, white leather shoes, wide sunglasses, jewellery accessories etc. Given his stature as a senior artist; Ajit was usually the gang leader to second tier villains (such as Jeevan (actor), Prem Chopra, Ranjeet, Kader Khan, Sujit Kumar). He was rarely portrayed (in movie roles) doing any \"dirty work\" himself, rather relaying on his army of henchmen for the task, with zero tolerance for any failures. He always had a savvy female accomplice, usually named \"Mona.\" Acting in over 200 films, he specialized in playing suave villains with memorable catch-phrases delivered in now iconic Ajit style nasal drawls such as \"Mona, darling\". Ajit also brought to fame the smuggler as the villain. In his movies, he is generally seen smuggling gold biscuits in or out of the country. It has also been noted that most of his gang members had Christian names like Robert, Michael, Peter etc. This also has been used for comic purposes in parodies. It was the menacing voice he was most famous for. He is still remembered for bringing the most famous villains in the history of Indian cinema to life. His contemporaries include veteran actors like Amrish Puri, Pran, Prem Chopra and Amjad Khan. Some of his popularity in present time is due to the innumerable jokes and parodies made on his famous lines by comedians."

He was critically acclaimed for his performance in Dil Chahta Hai (2001), Humraaz (2002), Gandhi, My Father (2007) and Dishoom (2016) Akshaye Khanna had a four year gap from his acting career following his role in Gali Gali Chor Hai. He returned in 2016 as an antagonistic character in the film Dishoom.   Akshay Khanna was born on 28 March 1975 in Mumbai. He is the second son of famous Bollywood actor and politician Vinod Khanna, and the younger brother of actor Rahul Khanna. After studying in Kishore Namit Kapoor Acting Institute in Mumbai, Khanna made his acting debut in Bollywood in 1997 with the movie Himalay Putra, which was produced by his father and went without much success at box office. His performance in his next release, J. P. Dutta-directed Border (1997), earned him the Filmfare Best Debut Award and a nomination for Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1998. After that a string of unsuccessful films followed such as Mohabbat (1997), Kudrat (1998), Laawaris (1999), Love You Hamesha (1999) and Dahek: A Burning Passion (1999). In 1999, he starred in Rishi Kapoor's Aa Ab Laut Chalen; though the film did average business, he was praised for his acting. He next starred in Subhash Ghai's Taal opposite Aishwarya Rai. The film became a critical and commercial success. In 2001, Khanna appeared in Farhan Akhtar's cult classic Dil Chahta Hai. This marked a turning point in his career: the film was a commercial and critical success and Khanna's performance was particularly applauded, later validated by Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2002. Dil Chahta Hai relaunched Akshaye Khanna and Saif Ali Khan's careers. In 2002, Khanna appeared in an Abbas-Mustan thriller Humraaz; his role as a convincing con-artist in this film earned him much critical acclaim and a nomination for a Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role. Khanna then plunged into the comedy genre with Priyadarshan\u2019s Hungama (2002) and Hulchul (2004) that became box office hits.

The Abbas-Mustan thriller was the fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film in 2008 and Khanna's performance in a negative role brought him awards in the Best Villain category. However, Khanna\u2019s portrayal of Harilal Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi's eldest son, in the critically acclaimed 2007 film Gandhi, My Father is unanimously acknowledged his best performance yet as an actor. In 2010, he starred in Anees Bazmee's No Problem with Sanjay Dutt, Anil Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut. Khanna's later releases did not fare well at the box office, but his performances in Aakrosh (2010) and Tees Maar Khan (2010) were well-received by critics and audience. After a four year hiatus, Khanna made his comeback in the film Dishoom. Akshaye Khanna, in 2013, reported a case of a couple duping him of \u20b950 lakh for doubling this amount in 45 days through commodity trading to the police."

After having obtained a black belt in Taekwondo while in India, he studied martial arts in Bangkok, Thailand, where he learned Muay Thai and worked as a chef and waiter. Upon his return to Mumbai, he commenced the teaching of martial arts. One of his students, an aspiring photographer, recommended Kumar into modelling which ultimately led to a modelling assignment. Kumar effectively made more money within the first two days of shooting, in comparison to his entire months salary, and therefore chose a modelling career path. He worked as an assistant for photographer Jayesh Sheth for 18 months without payment to shoot his first portfolio. He also worked as a background dancer in various films. One morning, he missed his flight for an ad-shoot in Bangalore. Disappointed with himself, he visited a film studio along with his portfolio. That evening, Kumar was signed for a lead role by producer Pramod Chakravarthy for the movie Deedar. Kumar made his first appearance as the lead actor opposite Raakhee and Shantipriya in Saugandh (1991), though he had appeared in the uncredited role of a martial arts instructor in the 1987 Mahesh Bhatt-directed and Kumar Gaurav starrer, Aaj. In the same year, he acted in Kishore Vyas-directed Dancer, which received poor reviews. The following year he starred in Abbas Mustan-directed suspense thriller, Khiladi, widely considered his breakthrough role. His next release was the Raj Sippy-directed detective film Mr. Bond, based on James Bond. His last release of 1992 was Deedar. It failed to perform well at the box office.

His role in the film earned Kumar his first nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare Awards and Star Screen award. During the same year, Kumar also had success with films like Suhaag and the low budget action film Elaan. All these achievements, promoted Kumar as one of the most successful actors of the year. In 1994, he appeared in 11 feature films. The following year, Kumar played dual role in Umesh Mehra-directed action thriller, Sabse Bada Khiladi, which was a commercial success. He proved to have success with the Khiladi series, as in the next year he starred in the fourth film of the Khiladi series, Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi opposite Rekha and Raveena Tandon. The film was a commercial success. During the film's shooting Kumar was injured. He received treatment in United States. Kumar played a supporting role in Yash Chopra-directed romance, Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), co-starring Shah Rukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor, for which he received his first nomination for the Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award. In the same year, he starred opposite Juhi Chawla in David Dhawan-directed comedy Mr. and Mrs. Khiladi, fifth instalment of the Khiladi series. Unlike his previous films of the series, it failed commercially. His following releases failed commercial and this caused a setback to his film career. In 1999, Kumar played opposite Twinkle Khanna in International Khiladi. The film turned out to be an average grosser at the box office. He received critical acclaim for his roles in the films Sangharsh and Jaanwar. Whilst the former did not make a profit at the box office, the latter turned out to be a commercial success and marked his comeback. In 2000, Kumar starred in the Priyadarshan-directed comedy Hera Pheri alongside Paresh Rawal and Sunil Shetty. The film which was a remake of Malayalam film Ramji Rao Speaking, became a commercial success and proved to be a turning point in Kumar's career. He also starred in the Dharmesh Darshan-directed romantic drama Dhadkan later that same year. The film performed moderately at the box office but Kumar was praised for his acting. Rediff.com's review stated that he had proved that he is \"director's actor\" and that \"he has worked hard on his role is apparent.\" That same year, he performed some of his most dangerous stunts in Neeraj Vora-directed action thriller Khiladi 420, where he climbed a running plane, stood on top of the plane flying a thousand feet in the air, and jumped from the plane onto a hot air balloon. In a later scene, he is also seen being chased by a car, dodging bullets, jumping off buildings, and climbing walls. His character in the film had two names and his role received mixed reviews. In his review, Taran Adarsh wrote that \"The actor does a great job in a role that has negative shades, but as a softie in the second half, he is just about okay. And that's mainly because he has been asked to do what he has been doing in film after film. Nevertheless, Khiladi 420 is amongst his finest performances.\" Sukanya Verma wrote \"Negative roles and Akshay Kumar don't go hand-in-hand.[...] Akshay is ridiculously over the top and irritating to the core. However, he manages a decent performance as the sober and suave Anand.\" His first release in 2001 was Suneel Darshan-directed drama Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love. Kumar was praised for his performance in the film. Next, he played a negative role in the Abbas Mustan-directed film Ajnabee. While reviewing the film for Rediff.com, Sarita Tanwar termed Kumar the \"surprise package\" of the film. She added that he was \"in total control as the bad guy.\" The film won him critical acclaim as well as his first Filmfare Award for Best Villain and IIFA award 2002 for Performance in a Negative Role.

Rediff.com's review of the film mentioned that his sincerity and intensity seen in Hera Pheri, Ek Rishtaa \u2013 The Bond Of Love and Aankhen \"seems missing\".

        "biography": " Alia Bhatt (born 15 March 1993) is a British film actress and singer who works in Bollywood. Born into the Bhatt family, she is the daughter of filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt and actress Soni Razdan. After making her acting debut as a child artist in the 1999 thriller Sangharsh, Bhatt played her first leading role in Karan Johar's romantic drama Student of the Year (2012), which earned her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. Bhatt established herself in Bollywood by starring as the female lead in several commercially successful films, including the romantic drama 2 States (2014), the romantic comedy Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania (2014), the drama Kapoor & Sons (2016), the coming-of-age film Dear Zindagi (2016), and the romantic comedy Badrinath Ki Dulhania (2017). She received critical acclaim for portraying emotionally intense characters in the road drama Highway (2014), which won her the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress, and the crime drama Udta Punjab (2016), which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. In addition to acting in films, Bhatt has launched her own line of clothing for women. She has sung six of her film songs and participates in stage shows and concert tours.   Bhatt was born on 15 March 1993, to Indian film director Mahesh Bhatt and actress Soni Razdan. Her father is of Gujarati descent and her mother is of Kashmiri and German ancestry. Director Nanabhai Bhatt is her paternal grandfather. She has an elder sister, Shaheen (born 1988) and two half-siblings, Pooja Bhatt and Rahul Bhatt. Actor Emraan Hashmi and director Mohit Suri are her maternal cousins, while producer Mukesh Bhatt is her uncle. Bhatt was educated at the Jamnabai Narsee School in Mumbai. Bhatt's first acting role was as a child artist in Sangharsh (1999), starring Akshay Kumar and Preity Zinta where she played the younger version of Zinta's character. She had her first leading role in 2012 with Karan Johar's Student of the Year, alongside Sidharth Malhotra and Varun Dhawan. She portrayed the role of Shanaya Singhania, a sophisticated teenage girl who is in a relationship with Dhawan's character but is attracted to the character played by Malhotra. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama wrote of her performance, \"Alia's role is reminiscent of Kareena Kapoor in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. Stylish, classy, born with a silver spoon, she's someone who loves to flaunt not just her clothes and bags, but also her riches. Extremely photogenic, Alia makes a super-confident debut.\" Anupama Chopra of Hindustan Times also mentioned the similarities with Kapoor's character, but noted that her performance was \"without the killer attitude.\" Student of the Year grossed \u20b9960 million (US$15\u00a0million) at the box office. Bhatt established herself in Bollywood with her three film releases of 2014. She played the protagonist of Imtiaz Ali's road film Highway opposite Randeep Hooda. Her portrayal of a lonely teenage girl who develops stockholm syndrome after being abducted was acclaimed by the critics. Rachit Gupta of Filmfare mentioned that \"[a]t 20, it\u2019s surprising how Alia has got so many deft nuances right. It\u2019s as if the actor has grown with the character. She is truly one of the most promising new actors in Hindi films.\" Sonia Chopra of Sify added that Bhatt is \"completely immersed\" in her role, and that \"Alia\u2019s uninhibited and raw performance will have you emotionally invested in her character all through.\" Though the film underperformed at the box office, Bhatt won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress and also garnered a Best Actress nomination at the ceremony. In Karan Johar and Sajid Nadiadwala's joint production 2 States, Bhatt starred opposite Arjun Kapoor. An adaptation of Chetan Bhagat's novel of the same name, it narrates the story of two IIM Ahmedabad students who encounter trouble in convincing their parents to approve of their relationship. For her role as Ananya Swaminatham, a headstrong Tamil girl, she learnt the language. Critics were appreciative of her performance with Rediff.com publishing that Bhatt \"really grows into the character and makes you believe that she's a career-oriented IIM-A grad.\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express added that Bhatt was a \"surprise\" and was \"easy and fresh and natural.\" The film emerged as a top-grossing production, earning over \u20b91.7 billion (US$26\u00a0million) worldwide. Bhatt's final film role in 2014 was as Kavya Pratap Singh, a Punjabi girl who engages in a romantic affair with a stranger a few days prior to her wedding, in Shashank Khaitan's romantic comedy Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania. Co-starring Varun Dhawan and Siddharth Shukla, the film was described as a tribute to Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) by Johar, who served as producer. Writing for India Today, Rohit Khilnani thought that Bhatt had pitched in \"one of her best performances so far\", though Nandini Ramnath of Mint found her performance to be lacking in subtlety, writing that she was \"more comfortable acting out her feelings through dialogue and actions\". Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania proved to be her second consecutive release to earn over \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million). Her accomplishments in 2014 led Box Office India to label her as the top Bollywood actress of the year. Also in 2014, Bhatt appeared in a short film on women's safety, entitled Going Home, from director Vikas Bahl. She next reunited with Bahl to film the romantic comedy Shaandaar. Released in 2015, the film featured Shahid Kapoor and Bhatt as two insomniacs who fall in love during a destination wedding. Kunal Guha of Mumbai Mirror criticised the film and wrote that Bhatt \"socks life into her character but fails to pump any into this film\". Shaandaar earned little at the box office. In 2016, Bhatt played the supporting role of a lively young girl with a buried past in Kapoor & Sons, a drama about a dysfunctional family starring Sidharth Malhotra and Fawad Khan. The film proved to be a critical and commercial success. Bhatt then took on the part of a poverty-stricken Bihari migrant in the Indian state of Punjab in Udta Punjab (2016), a crime drama about substance abuse from the director Abhishek Chaubey. The intense role marked a significant departure from the mostly light-hearted parts she had previously played, and in preparation, she watched documentaries on drug abuse and learned to speak a Bihari dialect. The film, co-starring Shahid Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor, and Diljit Dosanjh, generated controversy when the Central Board of Film Certification deemed that the film represented Punjab in a negative light and demanded extensive censorship before its theatrical release. The Bombay High Court later cleared the film for exhibition with one scene cut. Bhatt's performance in the film was critically acclaimed, with several commentators believing that it was her best performance to that point. Raja Sen of Rediff.com wrote that Bhatt \"commits to her accent and deals with the film's most unsavoury section, and is stunning during an incendiary speech that elevates the entire film to a whole other level.\" Bhatt continued to gain critical praise as she took on the role of an aspiring cinematographer whose life undergoes a series of changes after she consults a free-spirited psychologist (played by Shah Rukh Khan) in the coming-of-age film Dear Zindagi (2016). Writing for IndieWire, Anisha Jhaveri noted that Bhatt provides her character with \"a three-dimensionality in which the somewhat annoying nature of millennial angst is balanced with an innocence that\u2019s impossible not to recognize\". The film proved a box office success as well, earning a total of \u20b91.39 billion (US$22\u00a0million) worldwide. Udta Punjab and Dear Zindagi earned Bhatt several awards and nominations; for the former, she won the Screen Award and the Filmfare Award for Best Actress, and for the latter, she received an additional Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. The series of successful films continued with Bhatt's next project\u2014the romantic comedy Badrinath Ki Dulhania (2017)\u2014which reunited her with Khaitan and Dhawan. The film tells the story of an independent young woman (Bhatt) from rural India who refuses to conform to patriarchal expectations from her chauvinistic fiancee (Dhawan). Rachel Saltz of The New York Times took note of the film's statement on gender equality and wrote, \"Without ever falling into the clich\u00e9s of spunky Bollywood heroine, [Bhatt] effortlessly embodies that admirable thing: a modern woman.\" With over \u20b91.95 billion (US$30\u00a0million) in box office receipts, Badrinath Ki Dulhania proved to be Bhatt's highest-grossing release. As of March 2017, Bhatt has committed to star with Ranbir Kapoor in Ayan Mukerji's Dragon about a man with superpowers, and opposite Ranveer Singh in Zoya Akhtar's Gully Boy, a musical based on the life of rappers living in Mumbai's ghettos. Bhatt has performed playback singing for the song \"Sooha Saaha\" in Highway (2014). A. R. Rahman, the composer of the film, invited her to his music school to undergo training. In 2014, she sang the unplugged version of the song \"Samjhawan\", for the composers Sharib-Toshi, in Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania. In 2016, she sang an alternate version of the song \"Ikk Kudi\", for the soundtrack of Udta Punjab, with her co-star Dosanjh. In addition to acting in films, Bhatt has performed at the Filmfare, Screen and Stardust award ceremonies, and has also participated in a stage show in Hong Kong alongside Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra. In 2013, she performed at a charity event with Dhawan, Malhotra, Aditya Roy Kapur, Shraddha Kapoor and Huma Qureshi to raise funds for the flood-affected victims of Uttarakhand. In August 2016, she performed in various cities of the United States as a part of the \"Dream Team 2016\" tour, alongside actors Dhawan, Malhotra, Kapur, Katrina Kaif, Parineeti Chopra, filmmaker Karan Johar, and singer Badshah. In 2013, Bhatt took part in a campaign for PETA to raise awareness about homeless animals.

        "biography": " Ameesha Patel (pronounced\u00a0[\u0259\u02c8mi\u02d0\u0282a\u02d0 p\u0259\u02c8\u0288e\u02d0l]; born Amisha Amit Patel; 9 June 1975) is an Indian actress and model who predominantly appears in Bollywood films. She has also appeared in a few Telugu and Tamil films. Making her acting debut in the 2000 romantic thriller film, Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, Patel won critical praise for her performance in Gadar: Ek Prem Katha (2001), which became one of the biggest hits in the history of Hindi cinema, earning her a Filmfare Special Performance Award.

Her performance in the 2006 film Ankahee, received critical recognition. In 2007, she appeared in a supporting role in Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd. and also co-starred Akshay Kumar in Bhool Bhulaiyaa. Rediff featured Patel as one of the top Bollywood actresses of 2001. Patel is frequently cited as one of the \"sexiest\" Bollywood actresses of all time. In 2011, she founded her own production company Ameesha Patel Productions. In 2013, she made an extended special appearance in Race 2.   Patel was born in Gujarati family to Amit Patel and Asha Patel. She is sister of Ashmit Patel and the granddaughter of the famous lawyer-politician Barrister Rajni Patel who was the Congress Pradesh Committee President of Mumbai. She was born in the Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai and is a trained Bharatnatyam dancer since the age of five. Her birth name is a blend of the first three letters of her father's name Amit and the last three letters of her mother's name Asha. She studied at the Cathedral and John Connon School in Mumbai and was head girl for the academic year 1992\u201393 before heading overseas to study Bio-genetic engineering, which she studied for two years, and eventually switching to Economics at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. She graduated with a gold medal. Patel's career began as an economic analyst at Khandwala Securities Limited after graduation. Later on, she received an offer from Morgan Stanley but turned it down. After returning to India, she joined Satyadev Dubey's theatre group and acted in plays, including an Urdu language play titled Neelam (1999) that was written by Tanveer Khan, upon receiving permission from her conservative parents. At the same time she plunged into modelling appearing in several commercial campaigns. Patel has also modelled for well-known Indian brands like Bajaj Sevashram, Fair & Lovely, Cadburys Jai Lime, Fem, Lux and many more. Patel's first opportunity for acting came in the form of an offer from her father's schoolmate, Rakesh Roshan, to star opposite his son, Hrithik Roshan, in Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000). The offer came immediately after she graduated from high school but she refused the project because she wanted to continue her education in USA. Afterward, Kareena Kapoor replaced her but luckily, Kapoor dropped out a few days into principal photography and Patel was given the opportunity once again during a family lunch. She readily agreed to do the project this time. The role of an exuberant college girl in love, undergoing a tortuous time at losing her lover and rediscovering a more mature relationship gave Patel scope to perform. The film was a smashing success and established Patel as a rising star, earning her awards for Best Debut at a number of award ceremonies. In her second film, the Telugu language drama Badri, she starred opposite Pawan Kalyan. The film was a major success, grossing more than Rs 120 million in India. 2001 saw her appearing in Anil Sharma's cross-border romance, Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, alongside Sunny Deol. Patel signed on much before she shot into the limelight with Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai and was among 22 girls that were screen-tested from 500 girls who came to audition for the film. Patel had gone through a 12-hour audition before she got the part. The film went on to become the top-grossing film of the year, as well as the biggest hit of the 21st century, earning Rs 973 million in India. Set during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, it featured Patel as Sakeena, a Muslim girl who finds refuge in Deol's house during the riots, and subsequently falls for him. Her performance was praised, and won her the Filmfare Special Performance Award, as well as nominations for Best Actress at various award ceremonies. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM concluded, \"Despite being one-film-old, Amisha Patel deserves full marks for handling the complex role with elegance. She looks the character she is portraying and impresses with a natural performance.\" The film was perceived as being excessively anti-Pakistani. These successes were followed by a series of films that flopped at the box-office. In Yeh Zindagi Ka Safar (2001), she played a successful singer who was abandoned by her mother at the time of her birth. In 2002, Patel had three failures. In Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage, she played the role of Sapna who is caged in protective custody of her own father. She co-starred opposite Hrithik Roshan for the second time in this film. Unlike their successful pairing in Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, the film proved to be a disappointment and resulted in a critical and commercial failure. Patel's performance in the film was criticised by a section of the media, but during an interview she clarified that there was an \"error\" because the scene explaining that her character is supposed to be asthmatic in the film was edited out not knowing that one shot would make such a difference, thus creating confusion to the viewer about her appearing out of breath, as if she's overacting or crying. Patel's unsuccessful follow-up continued with Kranti and David Dhawan's comedy Yeh Hai Jalwa in 2002. In the same year, she tasted minor box office success with Kya Yehi Pyaar Hai, in which she played a career-oriented young woman who rejects the advances of Aftab Shivdasani's character. Then she found another major success when her last release of the year, Humraaz, became the fifth highest-grossing film of the year at the box office, and her performance earned her a nomination for Filmfare Best Actress Award. The Abbas-Mustan marital thriller saw her playing a character with negative shades for the first time. She played the girlfriend of Akshaye Khanna, who marries Bobby Deol to grab his wealth \u2013 but, seeing Bobby's honesty, her character surrenders to him. Taran Adarsh commented, \"Amisha Patel is just about okay as Akshaye's lover (first half), but splendid as Bobby's wife (second half). This performance should silence her detractors for sure. Also, she's looked her best with admirable outfits and perfect make-up.\" During 2003 to 2006, Patel's acting career entered a slump. After the relative success of Humraaz, Patel's string of unsuccessful films followed and would continue until 2006. In 2003, her only releases were Tamil language film Pudhiya Geethai and Hindi film Deepak Bahry's Parwana. Her releases in 2004, Vimal Kumar's comedy Suno Sasurjee, a delayed production since 2000, and her second Telugu language film Naani, followed. That year she also appeared in the music videos for O Meri Jaan and Hai Kasam Tu Na Ja by Adnan Sami. In 2005, she starred in Satish Kaushik's thriller Vaada, playing the role of Arjun Rampal's unfaithful wife who is followed by her obsessive ex-lover. In her next release, Elaan, she played a TV reporter. She later appeared in Ketan Mehta's historical drama Mangal Pandey: The Rising where she played the role of the soft-spoken Jwala, a Bengali widow who gets rescued from committing Sati by a British commanding officer. Patel was cast as a replacement for Aishwarya Rai under the recommendation of Aamir Khan who was impressed by her IQ level when he saw her on BBC under the segment of Question Time India in 2003. The film, which saw her appearing without make-up for the first time, became the third highest grosser of that year but due to its high budget, emerged an average earner at the box office. Her other releases that year include Zameer: The Fire Within, a delayed production since 2001, and the Telugu film Narasimhudu, both of which failed at the box office. Patel featured in six films in 2006, all of which failed commercially. She first starred in Mere Jeevan Saathi, a production that had been delayed since 2003. She next appeared as a blind girl in Humko Tumse Pyaar Hai, another delayed production since 2002. The film had a limited release and flopped badly with some critics describing it as \"outdated\". In Teesri Aankh: The Hidden Camera, she played the role of a mute girl who witnesses a murder. She learned the sign language in order to fit the role. Patel was next cast in Tathastu, based on Denzel Washington's thriller John Q (2002). Patel's fifth release in 2006, Ankahee, earned her critical praise despite its failure at the box office. The film centred around an extramarital affair with Patel playing a housewife whose husband cheats on her with a model. To understand the mentality of a wronged wife, Patel spoke to her own grandmother who had undergone a similar situation. Diganta Guha from Hindustan Times noted \"...it's Ameesha's performance that remains in your mind. She is dignity personified in the film, playing a woman betrayed in marriage, going all out to save it and in the end choosing her own path.\" Later that year, she appeared alongside Akshaye Khanna and Priyanka Chopra in Dharmesh Darshan's Aap Ki Khatir. After appearing in a series of box office flops during 2003\u20132006, Patel's career prospects began to improve in 2007. Her first release in that year was the multi-starrer comedy drama Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd.. The low-budget film became a moderate success at box office. Patel played the role of Karan Khanna's talkative wife who tries to overcome her husband's gay leanings. Patel's comic timing in the film was well received. Later in 2007, she co-starred opposite Akshay Kumar in Priyadarshan's hit Bhool Bhulaiyaa as a rejected adopted girl who is accused of trying to disrupt the marriage of her childhood crush. In an attempt to renew her image, Patel appeared in a bikini item number, Lazy Lamhe, in Kunal Kohli's Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic (2008). She learned scuba diving for the song that took 15 days to complete. Although the film flopped at the box office, Patel managed to garner attention for her appearance. Post the release of Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic, Patel signed on to two comedies; Run Bhola Run and Chatur Singh Two Star. However, both films were continuously delayed despite being completed in 2009. She next attempted a comeback by signing on to Rajkumar Santoshi's Power, but the film was shelved after eight days of principal photography. Despite repeated attempts to land a starring role, Patel dropped out of several projects due to various reasons. Following a two-and-a-half-year sabbatical, she made a comeback to the Telugu film industry in a brief role with Parama Veera Chakra (2011) alongside Nandamuri Balakrishna; the film flopped. In the same year, Chatur Singh Two Star released after a long delay and marked her return to Hindi cinema after three years. However, the film was a critical and commercial failure. Run Bhola Run remains unreleased following the shutting down of the production company, Shree Ashtavinayak Cine Vision, despite the trailer and posters being unveiled in late 2010. On 23 April 2011, Patel hosted an event launching her production company, Ameesha Patel Productions, in collaboration with her friend and business partner Kuunal Goomer. David Dhawan and Priyadarshan were signed on to direct films for her banner. In 2013, Patel co-starred in Abbas-Mustan's Race 2 as Anil Kapoor's ditzy assistant. Despite being a critical failure, the film emerged a box office success becoming the first film in that year to enter the 100 crore club. Patel next appeared alongside Neil Nitin Mukesh in Susi Ganeshan's Shortcut Romeo, a Hindi remake of his own 2006 Tamil hit Thiruttu Payale. The film received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box office primarily due to a limited release by its producer. However, Patel was recognised for her portrayal of an unfaithful housewife. As of July 2016, Patel completed 80% of her debut home production Desi Magic, the teaser was unveiled in late 2014. She has resumed filming Bhaiyyaji Superhitt opposite Sunny Deol, which was on hold since 2012. Patel performed in a number of concerts and world tours during her career. Her first world tour, The Roshans: Hrithik Live in Concert (2001), along with Hrithik Roshan was performed across India. In 2004, Patel took part in a series of concerts in the world tour Craze 2004 alongside Hrithik Roshan, Saif Ali Khan and Lara Dutta. In 2005, Patel participated in Adnan Sami's world tour Kuch Dil Se\u2026 that was performed across USA and Canada from 15 April till 15 May. In October 2008, she participated in Himesh Reshammiya's comeback concert Karzzzz Musical Curtain Raiser joined by Neha Dhupia, Riya Sen and Amrita Arora. In December 2008, she took part in Akshay Kumar's Christmas Eve show Chandni Chowk to Hong along with Bipasha Basu, Priyanka Chopra, Riya Sen, Aarti Chhabria, Himesh Reshammiya and Punjabi rapper Bohemia as part of a promotional campaign for Kumar's film Chandni Chowk to China (2009). In response to 26/11, many New Year's Eve concerts for 2009 were cancelled, but Patel and Country Club India decided to go ahead with their show because they thought it would be against the terrorists' will. In September 2004, Patel joined PETA, one of the organisations championing the cause of animals, as part of an advertising campaign which highlights the lives of captivated animals in a zoo who are robbed of their natural surroundings for the amusement of others. Patel posed as a petrified prisoner in a jail cell to throw focus on the plight of animals in zoos. She said, George Washington, Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi... we had them. Animals don't; they need us. Let's fight for their freedom. In February 2005, along with other Bollywood stars, Patel performed at the HELP! Telethon Concert raising money for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. She also took part in the Temptations 2005 charity function in New Delhi on 24 December 2005 at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium in aid of the National Centre for Promotion of Employment of Disabled Persons (NCPEDP), a leading disabled rights' group. In November 2006, Patel joined an NGO called PlanetRead, which helps people in villages to learn reading through film songs. In October 2007, Patel along with John Abraham and Kirron Kher joined the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to curb human trafficking in India. In 1999, Patel met filmmaker Vikram Bhatt on the set of their first movie together, Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage (2002), and they started dating since the film's release. Later, it caused a rift between the Patel and Bhatt families with Patel running through a financial crisis after her father used her hard-earned money to resurrect a family business, causing misunderstandings between Patel and her parents. In July 2004, Patel sent a legal notice to her father for mismanaging her accounts and assets amounting to Rs 120 million and demanding the money back. Patel's relationship with Bhatt was often reported to the media spectaculating a possible marriage. In January 2008, the media reported that Patel and Bhatt broke their five-year relationship. Bhatt confirmed the break-up in a conversation with Mid-Day. Shortly afterwards, Patel's parents explained their willingness to reconcile with their daughter and that \"everybody is happy about the break-up\" but their relationship remained strained. On 12 March 2008, Patel was spotted with London-based businessman Kanav Puri at Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week. In June 2008, she confirmed their relationship in an interview with Mid-Day: \"I did not admit to Kanav sooner because he's very special and I did not want to jinx it. It was too precious for me to talk about it to people. It's almost six months now and now I am feeling secure and now I know our relationship is too strong for anything or anyone to come between us.\" The media once reported that she got married to Puri but she denied these rumours. In August 2009, Mumbai Mirror reported that Patel and her brother, Ashmit, had patched up on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan and were spotted together at PVR Cinemas in Juhu. Although the siblings agreed that the matter is sorted, they preferred not to speak about it publicly. In December 2009, Patel's mother Asha had revealed they have finally ended their five-year estrangement during an interview with Times of India. In September 2010, Mumbai Mirror reported that Patel broke off the relationship with her long-time boyfriend Kanav Puri, to focus on her career. She confirmed it via Twitter. In August 2006, an Air India employee had filed a police complaint, alleging Patel had misbehaved with her after her companion was not upgraded to first class on the Mumbai-New York flight on 18 August. Patel was on her way to attend India's Independence Day parade in New York. Officers at the police station said Patel could be called in and warned about her behaviour, if charges against her are proved, and would be questioned once she returns from abroad. Later, CISF personnel have corroborated the Air India employees' version of the incident. Once Patel returned to India, she stated that the employees \"are only trying to safeguard themselves by filing a false complaint against us.\" Incidentally, there was also a drunken passenger, who joined in this verbal fight. Afterward, the organisers of the annual parade sent a written apology and a clarification to Patel and said it had booked two first class seats for Patel and her companion for the Mumbai-New York flight but the booking was automatically transferred from one flight to another, creating confusion. Between 2002 and 2005, Patel made an appearance in a number of talk shows such as Rendezvous with Simi Garewal and The Manish Malhotra Show. In 2006, Patel appeared as the guest judge on the special Valentine's Day episode of the singing talent contest, Indian Idol 2. Patel is frequently cited as one of the sexiest Bollywood actresses. Rediff featured Patel as one of Bollywood's sexiest actresses and top Bollywood actresses of 2001. She was ranked tenth on Rediff's list of 2008's Sexiest Actresses. Patel was also cited by Rediff as one of 2008's Sexiest Magazine Cover Girls. She has featured on the cover of Maxim India three times, as well as other men magazines such as The Man, FHM, and Man's World."

        "artist_name": "Amitabh_Bachchan", 
        "biography": " Amitabh Harivansh Rai Shrivastava Bachchan (IPA:\u00a0[\u0259m\u026a\u02c8ta\u02d0b\u02b1 \u02c8b\u0259t\u0283\u02d0\u0259n]; born 11 October 1942) is an Indian film actor. He first gained popularity in the early 1970s for movies like Zanjeer and Deewaar, and was dubbed India's first \"angry young man\" for his on-screen roles in Bollywood. Referred to as the \"Shahenshah of Bollywood\", \"Star of the Millennium\" or \"Big B\", he has since appeared in over 190 Indian films in a career spanning almost five decades. Bachchan is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential actors in the history of Indian cinema. So total was his dominance on the movie scene in the 1970s and 1980s that the French director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut called him a \"one-man industry.\" Bachchan has won numerous accolades in his career, including four National Film Awards as Best Actor and many awards at international film festivals and award ceremonies. He has won fifteen Filmfare Awards and is the most-nominated performer in any major acting category at Filmfare, with 41 nominations overall. In addition to acting, Bachchan has worked as a playback singer, film producer and television presenter. He has hosted several seasons of the game show, Kaun Banega Crorepati, India's version of the game show franchise, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. He also had a stint in politics in the 1980s. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri in 1984, the Padma Bhushan in 2001 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2015 for his contributions to the arts. The Government of France honoured him with its highest civilian honour, Knight of the Legion of Honour, in 2007 for his exceptional career in the world of cinema and beyond. Bachchan made his Hollywood debut in 2013 with The Great Gatsby, in which he played a non-Indian Jewish character, Meyer Wolfsheim.   Bachchan was born in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, in north central India. His ancestors hailed from a village called Babupatti in the Raniganj taluka of Pratapgarh district in Uttar Pradesh. His father Harivansh Rai Srivastava (Bachchan) was a well-known Hindi poet and his mother Teji Bachchan was a Punjabi Sikh from Lyallpur (now Faisalabad), Punjab. Bachchan was initially named Inquilaab, inspired by the phrase Inquilab Zindabad popularly used during the Indian independence struggle. In English, Inquilab Zindabad means \"Long live the revolution.\" However, at the suggestion of fellow poet Sumitranandan Pant, Harivansh Rai changed the boy's name to Amitabh, which means \"the light that will never die.\"[citation needed] Although his surname was Shrivastava, Amitabh's father had adopted the pen name Bachchan (\"child-like\" in colloquial Hindi), under which he published all of his works.[citation needed] It is with this last name that Amitabh debuted in films and for all other practical purposes, Bachchan has become the surname for all of his immediate family.[citation needed] Bachchan's father died in 2003, and his mother in 2007. Bachchan is an alumnus of Sherwood College, Nainital. He later attended Kirori Mal College, University of Delhi. He has a younger brother, Ajitabh. His mother had a keen interest in theatre and was offered a feature film role, but she preferred her domestic duties. Teji had some influence in Amitabh Bachchan's choice of career because she always insisted that he should \"take the centre stage.\" Bachchan is married to actress Jaya Bhaduri. The couple have two children, Shweta Nanda (wife of businessman Nikhil Nanda) and Abhishek Bachchan (actor and husband of actress Aishwarya Rai). Bachchan made his film debut in 1969 as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen's National Award winning film Bhuvan Shome. His first acting role was as one of the seven protagonists in the film Saat Hindustani directed by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and featuring Utpal Dutt, Anwar Ali (brother of comedian Mehmood), Madhu and Jalal Agha. Anand (1971) followed, in which Bachchan starred alongside Rajesh Khanna. His role as a doctor with a cynical view of life garnered Bachchan his first Filmfare Best Supporting Actor award. He then played his first antagonist role as an infatuated lover-turned-murderer in Parwana (1971). Following Parwaana were several films including Reshma Aur Shera (1971). During this time, he made a guest appearance in the film Guddi which starred his future wife Jaya Bhaduri. He narrated part of the film Bawarchi. In 1972 he made an appearance in the road action comedy Bombay to Goa directed by S. Ramanathan. Many of Bachchan's films during this early period did not do well, but that was about to change. Director Prakash Mehra cast him in the leading role for the film Zanjeer (1973) as Inspector Vijay Khanna. The film was a sharp contrast to the romantically themed films that had generally preceded it and established Amitabh in a new persona\u2014the \"angry young man\" of Bollywood cinema. Filmfare considers this one of the most iconic performances of Bollywood history. The film was a huge success and one of the highest-grossing films of that year, breaking Bachchan's dry spell at the box office and making him a star. From then onwards, Bachchan became one of the most successful leading men of the film industry. He earned his first Filmfare nomination for Best Actor for Zanjeer. The year 1973 was also when he married Jaya, and around this time they appeared in several films together; not only in Zanjeer but in films such as Abhimaan which followed and was released only a month after their marriage and was also successful at the box office. Later, Bachchan played the role of Vikram, once again along with Rajesh Khanna, in the film Namak Haraam, a social drama directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and scripted by Biresh Chatterjee addressing themes of friendship. His supporting role won him his second Filmfare Best Supporting Actor award. In 1974, Bachchan made several guest appearances in films such as Kunwara Baap and Dost, before playing a supporting role in Roti Kapda Aur Makaan. The film, directed and written by Manoj Kumar, addressed themes of honesty in the face of oppression and financial and emotional hardship and was the top earning film of 1974. Bachchan then played the leading role in film Majboor, released on 6 December 1974, which was a remake of the Hollywood film Zig Zag. The film was a success at the box office. In 1975, he starred in a variety of film genres from the comedy Chupke Chupke, the crime drama Faraar to the romantic drama Mili. 1975 was also the year when Bachchan appeared in two films regarded as important in Hindi cinema history. He starred in the Yash Chopra directed film Deewaar along with Shashi Kapoor, Nirupa Roy, and Neetu Singh, earning him a Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. The film became a major hit at the box office in 1975, ranking in at number 4. Indiatimes Movies ranks Deewaar amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films. Released on 15 August 1975 was Sholay, which became the highest-grossing film of 1975 and also of all time in India, earning INR 2,364,500,000 equivalent to US$60 million, after adjusting for inflation. in which Bachchan played the role of Jaidev. In 1999, BBC India declared it the \"Film of the Millennium\" and like Deewar, has been cited by Indiatimes movies as amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films. In that same year, the judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards awarded it with the special distinction award called Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years. In 1976, he was cast by Yash Chopra in the romantic family drama Kabhie Kabhie. Bachchan starred as a young poet named Amit Malhotra who falls deeply in love with a beautiful young girl named Pooja (Rakhee Gulzar) who ends up marrying someone else (Shashi Kapoor). The film was notable for portraying Bachchan as a romantic hero, a far cry from his \"angry young man\" roles like Zanjeer and Deewar. The film evoked a favourable response from critics and audiences alike. Bachchan was again nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for his role in the film. That same year he played a double role in Adalat as father and son. In 1977, he won his first Filmfare Best Actor Award for his performance in Amar Akbar Anthony where he played the third lead opposite Vinod Khanna and Rishi Kapoor as Anthony Gonsalves. The film was the highest-grossing film of that year. His other successes that year include Parvarish and Khoon Pasina. He once again resumed double roles in films such as Kasme Vaade (1978) as Amit and Shankar and Don (1978) playing the characters of Don, a leader of an underworld gang and his look alike Vijay. His performance won him his second Filmfare Best Actor Award. He also gave towering performances in Yash Chopra's Trishul and Prakash Mehra's Muqaddar Ka Sikandar both of which earned him further Filmfare Best Actor nominations. In 1979, Bachchan starred in Suhaag which was the highest earning film of that year. In the same year he also enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success with films like Mr. Natwarlal, Kaala Patthar and The Great Gambler. Amitabh was required to use his singing voice for the first time in a song from the film Mr. Natwarlal in which he starred with Rekha. Bachchan's performance in the film saw him nominated for both the Filmfare Best Actor Award and the Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer. He also received Best Actor nomination for Kaala Patthar and then went on to be nominated again in 1980 for the Raj Khosla directed film Dostana, in which he starred opposite Shatrughan Sinha and Zeenat Aman. Dostana proved to be the top-grossing film of 1980. In 1981, he starred in Yash Chopra's melodrama film Silsila, where he starred alongside his wife Jaya and Rekha. Other films of this period like Shaan (1980), Shakti (1982) which pitted him against the veteran actor Dilip Kumar were not successful at the box office but Ram Balram (1980), Naseeb (1981) and Lawaaris (1981) were successful. In 1982 he played double roles in the films Satte Pe Satta and Desh Premee which succeeded at the box office. In 1983 he played a triple role in Mahaan and starred in the top-grossing film of that year Coolie. On 26 July 1982, while filming Coolie,in the University Campus in Bangalore, Bachchan suffered a near fatal intestinal injury during the filming of a fight scene with co-actor Puneet Issar. Bachchan was performing his own stunts in the film and one scene required him to fall onto a table and then on the ground. However, as he jumped towards the table, the corner of the table struck his abdomen, resulting in a splenic rupture from which he lost a significant amount of blood. He required an emergency splenectomy and remained critically ill in hospital for many months, at times close to death. The public response included prayers in temples and offers to sacrifice limbs to save him, while later, there were long queues of well-wishing fans outside the hospital where he was recuperating. Nevertheless, he resumed filming later that year after a long period of recuperation. The film was released in 1983, and partly due to the huge publicity of Bachchan's accident, the film was a box office success and the top-grossing film that year. The director, Manmohan Desai, altered the ending of Coolie after Bachchan's accident. Bachchan's character was originally intended to have been killed off but after the change of script, the character lived in the end. It would have been inappropriate, said Desai, for the man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen. Also, in the released film the footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking this as the instant of the actor's injury and the ensuing publicity of the accident. Later, he was diagnosed with Myasthenia gravis. His illness made him feel weak both mentally and physically and he decided to quit films and venture into politics. At this time he became pessimistic, expressing concern with how a new film would be received and stated before every release, \"Yeh film to flop hogi!\" (\"This film will flop\"). In 1984, Bachchan took a break from acting and briefly entered politics in support of long-time family friend, Rajiv Gandhi. He contested Allahabad's seat of 8th Lok Sabha against H. N. Bahuguna, former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and won by one of the highest victory margins in general election history (68.2% of the vote). His political career, however, was short-lived: he resigned after three years, calling politics a cesspool. The resignation followed the implication of Bachchan and his brother in the \"Bofors scandal\" by a newspaper, which he vowed to take to court. Bachchan was eventually found not guilty of involvement in the ordeal[citation needed]. His old friend, Amar Singh, helped him during the financial crisis caused by the failure of his company, ABCL. Thereafter Bachchan started supporting the Samajwadi Party, the political party to which Amar Singh belonged. Furthermore, Jaya Bachchan joined the Samajwadi party and represented the party as an MP in the Rajya Sabha. Bachchan has continued to do favours for the Samajwadi party, including appearing in advertisements and political campaigns. These activities have recently got him into trouble in the Indian courts for false claims after a previous incident of submission of legal papers by him, stating that he is a farmer. A 15-year press ban against Bachchan was imposed during his peak acting years by Stardust and some of the other film magazines. In his defence, Bachchan claimed to have banned the press from entering his sets until late 1989. In 1988, Bachchan returned to films, playing the title role in Shahenshah, which was a box office success. After the success of his comeback film however, his star power began to wane as all of his subsequent films like Jaadugar, Toofan and Main Azaad Hoon (all released in 1989) failed at the box office. The 1991 hit film, Hum, for which he won his third Filmfare Best Actor Award, looked like it might reverse the trend, but this momentum was short-lived and his string of box office failures continued. Notably, despite the lack of hits, it was during this era that Bachchan won his first National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance as a Mafia don in the 1990 film Agneepath. These years would see his last on-screen appearances for some time. After the release of Khuda Gawah in 1992, Bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years. With the exception of the delayed release of Insaniyat (1994), which was also a box office failure, Bachchan did not appear in any new releases for five years. Bachchan turned producer during his temporary retirement period, setting up Amitabh Bachchan Corporation, Ltd. (ABCL) in 1996, with a vision of becoming a 10 billion rupees (approx. U.S. $250 M) premier entertainment company by the year 2000.[citation needed] ABCL's strategy was to introduce products and services covering an entire cross-section of India's entertainment industry. ABCL's operations were mainstream commercial film production and distribution, audio cassettes and video discs, production and marketing of television software, and celebrity and event management.[citation needed] Soon after the company was launched in 1996, the first film it produced was Tere Mere Sapne, which did not fare well at the boxoffice but launched the careers of actors like Arshad Warsi and South films star Simran.[citation needed] ABCL produced a few other films, none of which did well.[citation needed] In 1997, Bachchan attempted to make his acting comeback with the film Mrityudata, produced by ABCL. Though Mrityudaata attempted to reprise Bachchan's earlier success as an action hero, the film was a failure both financially and critically.[citation needed] ABCL was the main sponsor of the 1996 Miss World beauty pageant, Bangalore but lost millions. The fiasco and the consequent legal battles surrounding ABCL and various entities after the event, coupled with the fact that ABCL was reported to have overpaid most of its top level managers, eventually led to its financial and operational collapse in 1997. The company went into administration and was later declared a failed company by Indian Industries board.[citation needed] The Bombay high court, in April 1999, restrained Bachchan from selling off his Bombay bungalow 'Prateeksha' and two flats till the pending loan recovery cases of Canara Bank were disposed of. Bachchan had, however, pleaded that he had mortgaged his bungalow to raise funds for his company. Bachchan attempted to revive his acting career and had average success with Bade Miyan Chote Miyan (1998), and received positive reviews for Sooryavansham (1999) but other films such as Lal Baadshah (1999) and Hindustan Ki Kasam (1999) were box office failures. In 2000, Amitabh Bachchan appeared in Yash Chopra's box-office hit, Mohabbatein, directed by Aditya Chopra. He played a stern, older figure that rivalled the character of Shahrukh Khan. His role won him his third Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award. Other hits followed, with Bachchan appearing as an older family patriarch in Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love (2001), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001) and Baghban (2003).

College, Himachal Pradesh.[citation needed] Amrish Puri acted in more than 400 films between 1967 and 2005, and was one of the most successful villains in Bollywood. Puri first came to Mumbai following the footsteps of his elder brothers- Madan Puri and Chaman Puri, who were already established actors known for playing villainous roles. He failed his first screen test, and instead found a job with the Employees' State Insurance Corporation Ministry of Labour and Employment(ESIC). At the same time, he started performing at the Prithvi Theatre in plays written by Satyadev Dubey. He eventually became well known as a stage actor and won the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1979. This theatre recognition soon led to work in television ads and eventually to films at the relatively late age of 40. Puri went on to work in Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Hollywood, Punjabi, Malayalam, Telugu and Tamil films. Though he was successful in many regional films, he is best known for his work in Bollywood cinema. Through the 1970s, Puri often worked in supporting roles, usually as the henchman of the main villain. He was noticed in the 1980 super-hit movie Hum Paanch in which he played the main villain.

After playing a small role in Shakti (1982), he played his first Hindi film leading role in Woh Saat Din (1983) which was directed by Bapu and featured Padmini Kolhapure and Naseeruddin Shah.

He gained recognition in Bollywood with Yash Chopra's drama Mashaal (1984) as a Tapori, for which he won his first Filmfare Award in the Best Supporting Actor category. His Tapori persona and stubble look was considered unconventional at the time, but would become fashionable in India many years later. Kapoor's 1985 releases included Yudh and Saaheb. Yudh featured him uttering his iconic line \"Ek Dum Jhakaas\". But it was Meri Jung (1985), wherein he played the role of an angry young lawyer fighting for justice that gave him his 1st Filmfare best actor nomination. So all of Anil's films in 1985 were noticed and liked and he had truly arrived in the industry. Anil Kapoor played a comic Tapori again in Karma (1986), the biggest hit of the year.

Anil Kapoor had a title role in Shekhar Kapur's sci-fi film Mr. India (1987), the biggest hit of the year. The film became one of his biggest box office hits and shot him to superstar status. Anil Kapoor was equally impressive in Mahesh Bhatt directed film Thikana. In 1988 he was rewarded with his first Filmfare Best Actor Award for his performance in the film, Tezaab, the biggest blockbuster of 1988. Anil proved to be the only saving grace even in flops like Ram-Avtar& \" Vijay\". The following year he delivered Ram Lakhan (which became the second highest box office earner of 1989) with the song One Two Ka Four. In the film Parinda, Kapoor played his role with conviction and his biggest achievement was displaying the vulnerability of his character so perfectly. In Rakhwala Anil Kapoor again played the role of a Tapori, and the film was declared a success. Kapoor excelled in his portrayal of an autistic person in the 1989 film, Eeshwar and this film proved his versatility as an actor. The year 1990 saw him play a dual role, as twin brothers in the highly successful Kishen Kanhaiya and in the same year he further attained reasonable box office success with Ghar Ho To Aisa. Kapoor came up with a critically acclaimed performance in Awaargi. Many critics called that his best performance ever but the film flopped at the BO. also films like Jamai Raja and Jeevan Ek Sanghursh both South remakes were major flops . Madhuri starred with him in both these films. This was a setback in his career as 1990- was supposed to be the year when Anil would have been crowned Number 1 in Bollywood. But with these flops Anil was on the backfoot. This was followed by a restrained yet striking performance as a middle age man in Yash Chopra's romantic drama Lamhe, opposite actress Sridevi which won her Filmfare Best Actress Award a landmark film of Indian cinema and Yash Chopra's best work to date. It was the first film in which he appeared without a moustache. Although the film was a box office failure in India, it proved to be a success overseas.

In 1992, Kapoor received his second Filmfare Best Actor Award for his hard-hitting performance in Indra Kumar's Beta \u2014 the biggest blockbuster of the year opposite Madhuri Dixit. Kapoor was highly impressive with his comic act in Khel and his comic timing was one of the highlights of the film. In 1993, Boney Kapoor's much delayed mega-budget, Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja was a disaster at the box office and damaged Kapoor's reputation as the industry's biggest star at the time. The only major success in these years was Laadla again with Sridevi, a film produced by Nitin Manmohan. Kapoor gave a splendid performance as a simpleton lover in the hit musical 1942: A Love Story. His 1995 release, Trimurti was a box office disaster, though Kapoor's performance was creditable. Kapoor came up with a decent performance in the average performer Gharwali Baharwali. After a few box office failures, he had box office success with films like Loafer (1996),. In Judaai, Kapoor's depiction of a loving husband twisted between his two wives was appreciated and this film fared well at the box office. Deewana Mastana (1997), Biwi No.1 (1999) and Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain (1999) were box office hits. Kapoor\u2019s unusual characterization of a zealous, crooked musical superstar in Taal (1999) shocked both audience and critics alike. He also won rave reviews for his superb performance in Virasat, a remake of the Tamil film, Thevar Magan (1992), in which Kamal Hassan had played Kapoor's role. He also starred in the unsuccessful Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kaate, which was filmmaker Hrishikesh Mukherji's last commercial release, along with Juhi Chawla. He shaved his moustache once again for the film, in the second half, where he played actor Sajid Khan's wife and his delightful comic timing was a real treat to watch. Anil Kapoor's first release of 2000 was Bulandi, in which he played a double role, showing restraint and maturity as the elder Thakur. He won his first National Film Award in the Best Actor category for his role in Rajkumar Santoshi's critically acclaimed Pukar in 2000. Kapoor again tasted critical and commercial success with Hamara Dil Aapke Paas Hai in 2000. Kapoor stole the show as Rajeev in the much delayed, Karobaar, a film directed by Rakesh Roshan, where Kapoor\u2019s dialogue delivery was appreciated. He delivered a powerhouse performance in Shanker's Nayak which is considered to be his best performance by many. In 2002, Kapoor gave an excellent performance in the role of a fat man in Badhaai Ho Badhaai, a takeoff from the Hollywood hit, The Nutty Professor. He notched up yet another glorious performance in the Indra Kumar directed film Rishtey. In Om Jai Jagadish, he gave an amazing performance. Kapoor shared the screen with Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan for the first time in Armaan, and underplayed his character of a neurosurgeon superbly. In his 2003 release, Calcutta Mail, he delivered one of his best performances. His character was defined with ample scope to perform in this screenplay-driven performance and in spite of the strong supporting cast, this really came out as Kapoor's one-man show. He ignited the silver screen with an authoritative performance in Musafir alongside Sameera Reddy, Aditya Pancholi, Sanjay Dutt and Koena Mitra. Kapoor gave an incredibly restrained performance as the stricken husband in the thriller My Wife's Murder, which he also produced. Anees Bazmee's super-hit comedy No Entry (2005), followed for Kapoor that year. The film went on to become the highest-grossing film of the year. He was also in the film Bewafaa, playing a rich businessman who is forced to marry the sister of his wife after she passes away in childbirth. Kapoor played a grey character with finesse in the 2005 thriller, Chocolate. Anil's first release of 2007 Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love was a box office hit in overseas though a flop in India. Anees Bazmee's Welcome, which released on 21 December 2007 and was declared the biggest success of the year. Kapoor's understated performance in Subhash Ghai's Black and White was highly lauded. His first release in 2008, Abbas Mustan's thriller, Race became a box office hit. Vijay Krishna Acharya's, Tashan marked Anil's comeback to Yash Raj Films but failed to do well at the box office. His most recent films were his first English language film, Slumdog Millionaire, which was released on 12 November 2008, and Yuvvraaj, which was released on 21 November 2008. Yuvvraaj, with Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif in the lead roles, failed to do well at the box office. On the other hand, Slumdog Millionaire has won a number of international awards and received rave reviews from critics, costing only US $15 million to produce, but pulling in more than $352 million worldwide. In January 2009, he attended the 66th Golden Globe Awards ceremony along with the team of Slumdog Millionaire, which won four Golden Globe Awards. Kapoor demonstrated his well-known enthusiasm after Slumdog won the Academy Award for Best Picture (one of eight awards). also received a nomination for Best Ensemble at the Black Reel Awards of 2008 and has won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. In 2010, Kapoor starred in the eighth season of the American television series 24, portraying Omar Hassan, President of the fictional Islamic Republic of Kamistan. In October of that year he was cast to play a villain in both Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol (released in December 2011) and Power. Power was to be directed by Rajkumar Santoshi but was shelved due to unknown reasons. Other projects that he currently has in the pipeline include Cities (a Hollywood project co-starring Clive Owen and Orlando Bloom), Mr. India 2, the sequel to No Entry, Race 2 and Sanjay Gupta's Shootout at Wadala. He had also signed Khiladi 786, which released in December 2012 but did not appear in it eventually. Anil Kapoor's only release of 2012 Tezz earned him favorable reviews from critics; Taran Adarsh wrote that \"...it's a treat watching Anil Kapoor on screen. Though the actor has been an integral part of so many movies in the past, you can never accuse him of repeating himself. Besides, he may be in his early 50s, but that hasn't deterred Anil from performing the high-octane action stunts with flourish.\" His performance in Shootout at Wadala was highly acclaimed by critics; Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu wrote that \"Anil Kapoor is first rate, revelling in a tailor-made role as a no-nonsense cop, reminding us of the superstar he used to be in the Eighties.\" In January 2013 Kapoor became the first Indian actor to be invited for a special segment, 'In conversation', at the Toronto International Film Festival, an honour which is reserved for actors having considerable body of work. He is also currently[when?] starring in the lead role of Jai Singh Rathod in the Indian remade series of \"24.\" In September 2015, Kapoor made an appearance as himself in the ad for the upcoming Angry Birds Friends tournament Champions for Earth. Amazon has cast Kapoor in its pilot The Book of Strange New Things.[citation needed] He will play the role of Vikram Danesh, the authoritative head of the base on Oasis.  In 2002, Kapoor produced his first film, the comedy Badhaai Ho Badhaai, in which he also starred in. It was followed by My Wife's Murder (2005), and Gandhi, My Father (2007). Gandhi, My Father focuses on the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his son Harilal Gandhi and was awarded the National Film Award \u2013 Special Jury Award / Special Mention. He produced the movie Shortkut: The Con Is On starring Akshaye Khanna and Arshad Warsi. In 2010, he produced Aisha (2010 film), starring his daughter Sonam Kapoor and Abhay Deol in the lead roles. The film performed moderately at the box office, grossing Rs. 155\u00a0million in its theatrical run. He has acquired the remake rights for the American TV success, 24, reportedly for an amount of INR 1\u00a0billion. It took him about 1.5 years to license the rights to create an Indian rendition of the popular TV show. Kapoor will be stepping in the protagonist's (Jack Bauer) role as well. Kapoor played the role of President Hassan in the 8th season of the original series aired on Fox Network. Anil Kapoor has on rare occasions contributed to the soundtracks of his movies, as a singer. One of his first playback songs was the title track of the 1986 Bollywood comedy Chameli Ki Shaadi. The song was comic in nature and depicted the love story of the titular Chameli and her lover Charandas, played by Kapoor. Chameli was portrayed by Amrita Singh. In the same decade, he was credited on the song \"Tere Bina Main Nahin Mere Bina Tu Nahin\" for the film Woh Saat Din. He is also credited on the song \"I Love You\" from Hamara Dil Aapke Paas Hai. In 2008, Kapoor provided a rhyme-like-dialogue to introduce his character in Yashraj's Tashan. His theme was titled \"Bhaiyaji ka Tashan\". Interestingly, his co-stars in the movie also had their introductions incorporated in the soundtrack, which was composed by Vishal-Shekhar. Akshay Kumar's theme was titled \"Bachchan Pandey ka Tashan\". Kareena Kapoor's was \"Pooja ka Tashan\". Saif Ali Khan was credited for \"Jimmy ka Tashan\". He had one full album, \"Welcome\" as a co-singer with Salma Agha in 1986. The album was scored by Bappi Lahiri."

        "artist_name": "Anushka_Sharma", 
        "biography": " Anushka Sharma (pronounced\u00a0[\u0259\u02c8n\u028a\u0282ka\u02d0 \u02c8\u0283\u0259rma\u02d0]; born 1 May 1988) is an Indian film actress, producer and model. She has established a career in Hindi films, and is one of the most popular and highest-paid actresses in India. She is the recipient of numerous accolades, including one Filmfare Award from seven nominations. Born in Ayodhya and raised in Bangalore, Sharma had her first modelling assignment for the fashion designer Wendell Rodricks in 2007 and later moved to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career as a model. Following a successful audition at Yash Raj Films, she made her screen debut opposite Shah Rukh Khan in the blockbuster romance Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), which earned a Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination. Sharma rose to prominence with starring roles in Yash Raj Films's romances Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012); the latter won her a Best Supporting Actress award at Filmfare. She had her biggest commercial successes with the roles of a television reporter in the religious satire PK (2014) and a wrestler in the sports drama Sultan (2016), both of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films. Sharma received critical praise for her performances in the 2015 crime thriller NH10, which also marked her production debut, and the 2016 romantic drama Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, both of which earned her several awards and nominations. In addition to acting in films, Sharma is the ambassador for multiple brands and products, and has an active social media presence. She also supports various charities and causes, including gender equality and animal rights. She and her brother, Karnesh Sharma are the founders of the production company Clean Slate Films.   Anushka Sharma was born on 1 May 1988 in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. Her father, Colonel Ajay Kumar Sharma, is an army officer, and her mother, Ashima Sharma, is a homemaker. Her father is a native of Uttar Pradesh, while her mother is a Garhwali. Her elder brother is film producer Karnesh Sharma, who earlier served in the Merchant Navy. Sharma has stated that being a military brat played an important role in shaping her as a person and contributing to her life. In an interview with The Times of India in 2012, she said, \"I take pride in saying that I am an army officer's daughter even more than being an actor.\" Sharma was raised in Bangalore. She was educated at the Army School there, and received a degree in arts from Mount Carmel College. She originally intended to pursue a career in modelling or journalism, and had no aspirations to be an actress. After graduation, Sharma moved to Mumbai to further her modelling career. She enrolled herself at the Elite Model Management, and was groomed by the style consultant Prasad Bidapa. In 2007, Sharma made her runway debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Wendell Rodricks's Les Vamps Show and was picked to be his finale model at the Spring Summer 2007 Collection. Since then she has done campaigns for the brands Silk & Shine, Whisper, Nathella Jewelry and Fiat Palio. Sharma later said, \"I think I was born to emote and act. I would walk down the ramp and smile and they used to say, \u2018give us a blank look.\u2019 It was really difficult, not to smile\". Whilst modelling, Sharma also joined an acting school and began auditioning for film roles. Her first role was of an extra in the comedy drama Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006). Sharma's acting debut was in Aditya Chopra's romantic comedy Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), opposite Shah Rukh Khan. She took a day to prepare for her screen test at the Yash Raj Films studio and refused to do an impromptu one. She was signed for a three-film deal with the company and landed the leading role of Tani Sahni, a young bride to a middle-aged man, portrayed by Khan. Giving the film a three-and-half star rating, Khalid Mohamed called her \"assured and upright\", while Nikhat Kazmi wrote about Sharma's performance that she \"lacks all chutzpah and can barely hold your attention\". The film received positive reviews and was a major commercial success, emerging as the second-highest grossing Hindi film of that year. It earned her the Filmfare Awards nomination for Best Actress and Best Female Debut. Two years later, Sharma played the leading lady in the crime-comedy Badmaash Company, directed by Parmeet Sethi and co-starring Shahid Kapoor, Vir Das and Meiyang Chang. The film, dealing with four underachieving friends who begin a scam business enterprise, met with mixed reviews. Later in 2010, Sharma completed her three-film contract with Yash Raj Films by starring in Band Baaja Baaraat, a romantic comedy directed by Maneesh Sharma and co-starring debutant Ranveer Singh. Her role was that of Shruti Kakkar, an ambitious middle-class Punjabi girl who starts her own wedding planning business. In preparation for the part, Sharma learned to speak in the Punjabi dialect, which she cited as the toughest part of her role; she described the way the lead characters in the film interact as \"crude but cute\" which required her to \"talk fast, sometimes mix words and even omit words completely\". Trade analysts expressed doubt on Band Baaja Baaraat's financial prospect, citing the middling response to Yash Raj Films' last few productions, the lack of a male star, and saying that by then Sharma was an \"almost-forgotten\" actress. However, Band Baaja Baaraat earned positive reviews and emerged a sleeper hit. The film grossed approximately \u20b9\u00a0214.4\u00a0million after five weeks, making it a moderate box office success. Sharma's performance was praised by critics, many of whom cited it as her best work up to date. Film critic Anupama Chopra praised Sharma and said that she \"comes into her own as the ambitious Delhi girl, who dreams of upgrading to multi-crore Sainik Farms weddings\". For her work in the film, Sharma received her second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Sharma's first venture outside of the Yash Raj banner was the drama Patiala House (2011) directed by Nikhil Advani and co-starring Akshay Kumar. The film tells the story of a budding cricketer (played by Kumar) who encounters trouble in convincing his father of his profession; Sharma was cast as the love interest of Kumar's character. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com praised Sharma's work and labelled her a \"metaphor for energy\". The same year, she re-united with her Band Baaja Baarat co-star Ranveer Singh and director Maneesh Sharma for the comedy-drama Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, produced by Yash Raj Films. She featured as Ishika Desai, a salesgirl hired to outwit a conman (essayed by Singh), who ends up falling in love with him instead. The film and Sharma's performance received mixed reviews, with Piyali Dasgupta of NDTV calling her \"believable but not endearing\". Despite mixed reviews, the film was a moderate success at the box office. In 2012, Sharma played a supporting role alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif in Yash Chopra's \"swan song\", the romance Jab Tak Hai Jaan, which marked her fifth collaboration with Yash Raj Films and her second with Khan. She was cast as Akira Rai, a Discovery Channel reporter who harbours an ambition of making documentary films. CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand wrote that Sharma \"brings a spark to the film\", however, Raja Sen disagreed and said that \"while Anushka can indeed play spunky, she needed here to tone it down several notches\". For her role, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Jab Tak Hai Jaan went on to become the third highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2012. Sharma then appeared in Vishal Bhardwaj's Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola (2013), a political satire set in a village in Haryana. Co-starring alongside Pankaj Kapur, Imran Khan and Shabana Azmi, Sharma played the titular role of Bijlee Mandola, a strong-headed girl who engages in a romantic affair with Khan's character despite being engaged to another man. The film received positive to mixed reviews from critics, and underperformed at the box office. Several critics noted that Sharma was being stereotyped as a loud and loquacious girl; Raja Sen noted that she \"is great in a couple of scenes near the climax,\" though Kanika Sikka of Daily News and Analysis was more critical and found her \"unconvincing\". The following year, she portrayed Jagat \"Jaggu\" Janini, a television journalist who befriends an alien (played by Aamir Khan), in Rajkumar Hirani's religious satire PK. Critic Saibal Chatterjee wrote that Sharma plays \"a feisty poetry-loving girl who knows her mind far more than most Hindi film heroines are allowed to\" and praised her for \"hold[ing] her own\" against Khan. The film garnered critical acclaim and emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film with a worldwide revenue of over \u20b97 billion (US$110\u00a0million). In 2014, Sharma established her own production company named Clean Slate Films, whose first release was Navdeep Singh's thriller NH10 (2015), in which she also played the lead role. Screened at the 5th Beijing International Film Festival, the film tells the story of a married couple whose lives are endangered after an encounter with a group of criminals. In preparation for the role, Sharma underwent interval training for three months in order to build stamina and remain fit. Writing for NDTV, critic Saibal Chatterjee found the film to be a \"taut and riveting thriller\" and praised Sharma for \"conveying a range of moods as she moves from the vulnerable to the fearless in a battle in which the odds are stacked heavily against her\", and Prarthana Sarkar of International Business Times credited her for \"breaking the 'Miss Bubbly' stereotype\". The film also emerged as a box office success. In Anurag Kashyap's period crime drama Bombay Velvet (2015), (based on the historian Gyan Prakash's book Mumbai Fables) co-starring Ranbir Kapoor and Karan Johar, Sharma was cast in the role of a jazz singer, Rosie Noronha. Her character was referenced from yesteryear stars like Brigitte Bardot, Helen and Waheeda Rehman. As part of her preparation, Sharma watched a lot of films of the 1950s and 1960s, as well as a documentary showing the development of hair and make-up over the years. She also revealed to have used temporary lip enhancers as a part of her make up in the film, citing it as the reason behind her changed appearance on a chat show in 2014, and refuting media speculations about her having undergone plastic surgery. Bombay Velvet was screened at the Locarno and Bucheon film festivals, but critical reviews on it were mixed. Writing for Business Standard, Ritika Bhatia praised Sharma's performance in the song \"Dhadaam Dhadaam\": \"she fills the stage with such raw emotion that her mascara-laden tears and fake eyelashes flutter with arresting passion\". However, the film proved to be a box office failure, failing to recover its \u20b91.2 billion (US$19\u00a0million) investment. The same year, she featured in a supporting role of a dancer aboard a cruise ship in Zoya Akhtar's Dil Dhadakne Do, an ensemble comedy-drama starring Anil Kapoor, Shefali Shah, Priyanka Chopra and Ranveer Singh. The song \"Pehli Baar\" in the film was choreographed by her and Singh; Shilpa Jamkhandikar of Reuters praised their on-screen chemistry and described it as \"crackling\". Her performances in NH10 and Dil Dhadakne Do earned her Filmfare Award nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. Sharma next reunited with Yash Raj Films in Sultan (2016), a romantic sports drama from the writer-director Ali Abbas Zafar. She took on the role of Aarfa Hussain, a wrestler from Haryana who inspires the title character (played by Salman Khan) to take up the sport. Sharma was initially hesitant about the role as she did not have the physique of a wrestler, and researched on different weight categories to \"beat people\u2019s perception that all wrestlers are huge.\" She was trained for six weeks in the sport, learned to speak the Haryanvi dialect and also interacted with female wrestlers from the state. The film, as well as her performance received mixed to positive reviews. Critics were appreciative of her substantial role in an androcentric film; Filmfare's Rachit Gupta described Sharma as \"the best thing in the film\" and noted that [e]ven though she doesn't have the physique of a wrestler, her spirited performance makes you believe in her tough but emotional character.\" However, Suprateek Chatterjee of The Huffington Post felt that she was unconvincing as a wrestler, writing that \"she possesses literally zero muscles and somehow always finds the time to get her make-up just right.\u201d With earnings of over \u20b95 billion (US$77\u00a0million) worldwide, Sultan ranks among Indian cinema's biggest grossers. Sharma achieved further success later that year when she played the lead female role of Alizeh Khan, a free-spirited girl who suffers from cancer in Karan Johar's romantic drama Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, alongside Rabir Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai. Mike Maccahil of The Guardian took note of how much Sharma \"terrific spikiness\" and her chemistry with Kapoor helped a mediocre picture. In another typical mixed review, Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times praised Sharma's empowered female lead. The film earned over \u20b92 billion (US$31\u00a0million) worldwide, and Sharma received a Best Actress nomination at the 62nd Filmfare Awards. With two top-grossing films in 2016, Bollywood Hungama ranked Sharma as the most successful Bollywood actress of the year. Sharma began 2017 with the romantic comedy Phillauri. Co-starring Suraj Sharma and Diljit Dosanjh, the film revolves around a young man, who unknowingly marries a ghost, and reunites her with her dead lover. In addition to acting and producing, Sharma also sang a song for the film. As of February 2017, Sharma is filming for Imtiaz Ali's romance The Ring, which will mark her third collaboration with Shah Rukh Khan. In addition, Sharma has committed to appear in the comedy Kaneda, alongside Arjun Kapoor and Diljit Dosanjh, and has shot a cameo appearance for Rajkumar Hirani's biopic on the actor Sanjay Dutt, entitled Dutt. As of September 2014, Sharma is pursuing a Master of Economics degree through correspondence. She started practising vegetarianism in 2015. The Times of India has listed her as one of \"Bollywood's hottest vegetarian celebrities\". She was also named as the \"hottest vegetarian of 2015\" by PETA . She is an avid practitioner of Transcendental Meditation. Sharma has confessed to being a victim of anxiety disorder and seeking treatment for it. As of September 2015, Sharma is in a relationship with cricketer Virat Kohli. Their relationship has attracted substantial media coverage in India, though she is reluctant to openly talk about it. A practicing Hindu, Sharma along with her family is a follower of 'Anant Dham Atmabodh Ashram' in Haridwar. The ashram is headed by Maharaj Anant Baba, who is her family's spiritual guru and the actress is a regular visitor to the ashram. In September 2013, Sharma participated and walked the ramp in a fashion show that was held in memory of the late filmmaker, Yash Chopra. She participated in the opening ceremony of the 2015 Indian Premier League held at Kolkata, along with other celebrities including Hrithik Roshan, Shahid Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan, Farhan Akhtar and composer Pritam. Apart from acting, Sharma supports a number of charities and causes. She walked the ramp to support Shabana Azmi's Mijwan Welfare Society, an NGO that helps empower women. In 2013, alongside other Bollywood actors, she pledged to support the education of India's young girls as part of NDTV's \"Our Girls, Our Pride\" fundraiser. That same year, she appeared alongside other celebrities in a commercial, produced by the National Film Development Corporation of India, to create awareness about the 'Right to Education' for children. In December 2014, Sharma auctioned the leather jacket she wore in Jab Tak Hai Jaan on eBay, with proceeds going to the redevelopment of the flood-ravaged states of Kashmir and Assam. Sharma had also fronted a campaign to collect donations for the victims of the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. She supports the annual Mumbai Film Festival, and donated money in its cause in 2015. Sharma has been vocal about the disparity in the pay that actresses command, in comparison with their male counterparts in the film industry. In 2016, she supported India's first transgender band, the 6-Pack Band (initiated by Y-Films), by providing a voice over in their first single, \"Hum Hain Happy.\" Sharma has also spoken up for animal rights on social media. In April 2014, she took to Twitter to ask for a ban on horse-drawn carriages in Mumbai. In June 2015, she condemned the Yulin Dog Meat Festival in China, and urged her fans to sign an online petition aimed at stopping it. In October 2015, she launched 'Pawsitivity', a campaign aimed at sensitising people about the adverse effects of noise, air, water and soil pollution on animals. She said, \"Animals make the world a better place and it is our responsibility to be sensitive towards them as they don't have a voice.\" Priya Gupta of The Times of India has said that \"the best part of [Sharma's] stardom is that she does not have the trappings of a star.\" Kalpana Nair of Firstpost stated: \"actresses like Sharma command the respect they do in a largely conservative and male-dominated industry and the fact that their fan base grows when they take on roles that are not conventional is good reason for us to beam widely and walk with a spring in our step\". Samar Srivastava, writing for Forbes, called her \"unafraid\", and added: \"you would be hard-pressed to associate Sharma with the stereotype of a mainstream leading lady.\" The Times of India published that \"..she never shies away from putting [her opinion] across.\" Sharma featured on Rediff.com's list of \"Bollywood's Best Actors\" for Band Baaja Baaraat (2010), and NH10 (2015).

The role would've lost its bearings had it been entrusted to an inferior actor, but Arjun sinks his teeth into it and emerges trumps. The actor portrays the gamut of emotions with aplomb and delivers a flawless performance. He is truly efficient in sequences when he starts suspecting his wife's fidelity in the first half. The shower sequence as also the intermission point display Arjun's range as an actor.\" Rampal's last release of the year was Apoorva Lakhia's Ek Ajnabee opposite Amitabh Harivansh Rai Bachchan and Perizaad Zorabian.

He wrote \"It's only after the interval that the plot meanders a bit, loses it sting and almost falls apart like a pixealised image, before Arjun lights up the screen.\" Arthur J Pais of Rediff.com wrote \"The best person to gain from the film directed by Anubhav Sinha with more inane and crude sexual jokes than in any recent Hindi film, is Arjun Rampal. His body language and brooding face creates a quietly menacing villain.\" Raja Sen wrote \"Arjun Rampal is the best thing in the biggest budget Indian feature of all time\". Aseem Chhabra considered Rampal to be the \"most interesting element of the film.\" Rampal had three releases in 2012: Madhur Bhandarkar's Heroine, Prakash Jha's Chakravyuh and the comedy movie Ajab Gazabb Love, with all three failing at the box office.

Movies wrote \"As a former army officer and now an undercover agent, Arjun is intense and sharp, his body language apt and his performance precise.\" Shubha Shetty of Mid Day wrote \"It is Arjun Rampal as Rudra who amazes with a performance that is undoubtedly his best till date.

        "artist_name": "Asha_Parekh", 
        "biography": " Asha Parekh (born 2 October 1942) is a Bollywood actress, director, and producer. She was one of the top stars in Hindi films from 1959 to 1973. In 1992, she was honoured with the Padma Shri by the Government of India. Parekh is regarded as one of the most successful and influential Hindi movie actresses of all time.   Asha Parekh was born into a middle-class Gujarati Jain family on 2 October 1942 in Mumbai, to a father (who was from Paldi near Pirana, Ahmedabad, Gujarat) and a Dawoodi Bohra Muslim mother. Parekh's religious upbringing involved worshipping Sai Baba. Her mother enrolled her in Indian classical dance classes at an early age and she learned from many teachers including Pandit Bansilal Bharati. Parekh started her career as a child artist under the screen name Baby Asha Parekh. Famed film director Bimal Roy saw her dance at a stage function and cast her at the age of ten in Maa (1952 film) and then repeated her in Baap Beti (1954). The latter film's failure disappointed her and even though she did a few more child roles, she quit to resume her schooling. At sixteen she decided to try acting again and make her debut as a heroine, but she was rejected from Vijay Bhatt's Goonj Uthi Shehnai (1959) in favour of actress Ameeta, because the filmmaker claimed she was not star material. Precisely eight days later, film producer Subodh Mukherjee and writer-director Nasir Hussain cast her as the heroine in Dil Deke Dekho (1959) opposite Shammi Kapoor, which made her a huge star. The film also led to a long and fruitful association with Hussain. He went on to cast Parekh as the heroine in six more of his films: Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai (1961), Phir Wohi Dil Laya Hoon (1963), Teesri Manzil (1966), Baharon Ke Sapne (1967), Pyar Ka Mausam (1969), and Caravan (1971). She also did a cameo in his film Manzil Manzil (1984). Hussain also got her involved in distribution of films for 21 films, starting with Baharon Ke Sapne (1967). Parekh was primarily known as a glamour girl/excellent dancer/tomboy in most of her films, until director Raj Khosla gave her a serious image by casting her in tragedienne roles in three of her favourite films: Do Badan (1966), Chirag (1969), and Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki (1978). Director Shakti Samanta gave her more dramatic roles in her other favourite films, Pagla Kahin Ka (1970) and Kati Patang (1970); the latter earned her the Filmfare Best Actress Award. Many important directors cast her in several of their films, including Vijay Anand, Mohan Segal. Parekh acted in her mother tongue by starring in three Gujarati films at the height of her fame in Hindi films, the first being Akhand Saubhagyavati (1963), which became a huge hit. She also acted in some Punjabi films, such as Kankan De Ohle (1971) opposite Dharmendra and Lambhardarni (1976) with Dara Singh, as well as the hit Kannada film Sharavegada Saradara (1989). After her days as a leading lady ended, Parekh took on supporting roles as bhabhi (sister-in-law) and mother, but she called this the \"awkward phase\" of her career. So she stopped acting in films, and her friends recommended that she become a television director. She took their advice and became a television director in the early 1990s with the Gujarati serial Jyoti. She formed a production company, Akruti, and produced serials like Palash ke Phool, Baaje Payal, Kora Kagaz and a comedy, Dal Mein Kaala. She was the president of the Cine Artistes' Association from 1994 to 2000. Parekh was the first female chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification (Censor Board) of India. She held the post from 1998 to 2001 for which she received no salary but plenty of controversy for censoring films and for not giving clearance to Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth. Later, she became the treasurer of the Cine and Television Artists Association (CINTAA) and was later elected as one of its officebearers. Asha stopped acting in 1995 to pursue directing and producing television serials. Parekh received the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002. She has continued to receive other Lifetime Achievement Awards: the Kalakar Award in 2004; the International Indian Film Academy Awards in 2006; the Pune International Film Festival Award in 2007; and the Ninth Annual Bollywood Award in Long Island, New York in 2007. She received the Living Legend Award from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). In 2008, she was a judge on the reality show Tyohaar Dhamaaka on the Indian entertainment channel 9X. In 2017, her autobiography (co-written by Khalid Mohammed) titled \"The Hit Girl\" was released. Parekh has remained unmarried, claiming that her reputation of being unapproachable made people hesitate in asking for her hand in marriage. In her memoir \"The Hit Girl\", she confirmed rumors that she was romantically involved with her married director Nasir Hussain but out of respect for both their families, she couldn't marry him. Previously, Parekh would only state that she had a longtime boyfriend but declined to elaborate on the relationship, only stating that \"it was nice while it lasted.\" She said she had not seen Nasir Hussain during the last year of his life, as he became reclusive because of his wife's death, but she did speak to him the day before he died in 2002. Today, Parekh concentrates on her dance academy Kara Bhavan and the Asha Parekh Hospital in Santa Cruz, Mumbai, named in her honour because of her many humanitarian contributions. Asha Parekh has acted in 90 films."

        "artist_name": "Balraj_Sahni", 
        "biography": " Balraj Sahni (1 May 1913 \u2013 13 April 1973), born Yudhishthir Sahni, was a noted Indian film and stage actor, who is best known for Dharti Ke Lal (1946), Do Bigha Zameen (1953), Kabuliwala (1961) and Garam Hawa (1973). He came from Bhera, now in Punjab, Pakistan, and was the brother of Bhisham Sahni, noted Hindi writer, playwright, and actor.   Sahni was born on 1 May 1913 in Rawalpindi, British India. He studied at Lahore University, Punjab, British India. After completing his master's degree in English Literature from Lahore, he went back to Rawalpindi and joined his family business. He also held a Bachelor's degree in Hindi, followed by a Masters in English from Punjab University. Soon after he married Damayanti Sahni. In the late 1930s, Sahni and his wife left Rawalpindi to join Tagore's Visva-Bharati University in Shantiniketan in Bengal as an English and Hindi teacher. It is here that their son, Parikshit Sahni was born, when his wife Damayanti was doing her bachelor's degree. He also went to work with Mahatma Gandhi for a year in 1938. The next year, Sahni, with Gandhi's blessings, went to England to join the BBC-London's Hindi service as a radio announcer. He returned to India in 1943. Sahni was always interested in acting, and started his acting career with the plays of the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA). Incidentally his wife Damayanti became well-known as an IPTA actress much before Sahni made a name for himself in films. He started his film career in Mumbai with the film Insaaf (1946), followed by Dharti Ke Lal directed by KA Abbas in 1946 (Damayanti's first film), Door Chalein in 1946, and other films. But it was in 1953, with Bimal Roy's classic Do Bigha Zameen, that his true forte as an actor was first recognised. The film won the international prize at the Cannes Film Festival. He followed it up with an encore in the 1961 classic Kabuliwala penned by Tagore. Sahni's wife Damayanti, who was the heroine of his 1947 film Gudia, died at a young age that same year. Two years later, he married his first cousin, Santosh Chandhok, later known as an author and television writer. Sahni's acting was very well liked and appreciated in all his films. He acted opposite top heroines like Padmini, Nutan, Meena Kumari, Vyjayantimala, and Nargis in films like Bindya Seema (1955), Sone Ki Chidiya (1958), Sutta Bazaar (1959), Bhabhi Ki Chudiyaan (1961), Kathputli (1957), Lajwanti (1958) & Ghar Sansaar (1958).his character roles in films like \"Neelkamal\",\"ghar ghar ki kahani\" \"Do raste\"and \"ek phool do mali\" were greatly appreciated. However, he is perhaps best remembered by the current generation for the picturisation of the legendary song Ae Meri Zohra Jabeen from the movie Waqt (1965) on him. Sahni appeared opposite Achala Sachdev in the number. He also starred in the classic Punjabi film Nanak Dukhiya Sub Sansar (1970) as well as the critically acclaimed Satluj De Kande. His role as the angst ridden but stoical Muslim man who refuses to go to Pakistan during partition, in his last film Garam Hawa, has often been called his best performance by critics. Balraj, however, could not see the completed film to rate his own performance, as he died just the day after he finished dubbing work. The last line he recorded for the film, and hence his last recorded line is, Hindustani:- \"Insaan Kab Tak Akela Jee Sakta Hai?\" which can be translated in English as:- \"How long can a man live alone?\" Sahni was a gifted writer; his early writings were in English, though later in life he switched to Punjabi, and became a writer of repute in Punjabi literature. In 1960, after a visit to Pakistan, he wrote Mera Pakistani Safar. His book Mera Rusi Safarnama, which he had written after a tour of the erstwhile Soviet Union in 1969, earned him the 'Soviet Land Nehru Award'. He contributed many poems and short stories in magazines and also penned his autobiography, Meri Filmi Aatmakatha. Sahni was an extremely well-read and politically conscious person. He and P K Vasudevan Nair worked on the idea of All India Youth Federation with firebrand Delhi communist, Comrade Guru Radha Kishan to organise the first national conference of AIYF in Delhi. Their wholehearted efforts were visible as more than 250 delegates and observers representing several youth organisations of various states of India attended this session. Balraj Sahni was elected as the first president of All India Youth Federation, the youth wing of Communist Party of India. The organisation was a huge success and strong presence of the organisation was noticed by other political groups and the senior communist leaders everywhere. Sahni also dabbled in screenwriting; he wrote the 1951 movie Baazi which starred Dev Anand and was directed by Guru Dutt. He was also a recipient of the Padma Shri Award (1969). Balraj Sahni also wrote in Punjabi and contributed to the Punjabi magazine Preetlari. Very few people know about his love for the books, In 1950s he was first to inaugurate the Library and study centre for underprivileged class in Delhi. Sahni was undoubtedly one of the greatest actors ever to come on the Indian screen: a highly natural actor who reminded the audience of the actors like Motilal because of his simple persona and a sophisticated style of acting. He was looked up to as a role model as he was never involved in any scandal. His acting in Do Bigha Zameen and Garam Hawa were the highlights of his career. He believed in what is known as Neo-Realistic cinema. Balraj's brother Bhisham Sahni was a well-known writer who wrote the book Tamas. His son Parikshit Sahni is also an actor. Balraj Sahni died on 13 April 1973, of a massive cardiac arrest, less than a month before his 60th birthday. He had been depressed for some time by the untimely death of his young daughter, Shabnam. 'Punjabi Kala Kender', founded in 1973 at Mumbai by Balraj Sahni, gives away the annual Balraj Sahni Award', and also the 'All India Artists' Association'. A postage stamp, bearing his face, was released by India Post to honour him on 3 May 2013."

        "biography": " Bina Rai (Hindi: \u092c\u0940\u0928\u093e \u0930\u093e\u092f; 13 July 1931 \u2013 6 December 2009), aka \"Beena Roy\", was a leading actress primarily of the black and white era of Hindi cinema. She is most known for her roles in classics such as Anarkali (1953), Taj Mahal (1963), and won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film, Ghunghat (1960).   Bina Rai born as Krishna Sarin hailed from Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. In 1947, her family was uprooted from Lahore, Pakistan during the communal frenzy and was resettled in U.P. She went to school in Lahore and then college in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. Bina Rai lived in Kanpur until she moved out for acting. She had to convince her parents to allow her to act in films, she claimed that she went on a hunger strike to convince her disapproving parents to let her join films, and they finally relented. Bina Rai was a first year student of Arts in the Isabella Thoburn College of Lucknow in 1950[citation needed], when she came across an advertisement for a talent contest, she applied and received a call from the sponsors. Although she had been active in college dramatics, a film career was never within her field of vision. Nevertheless, she went to Bombay, to participate in the contest where she won along with the 25,000 rupees in prize money[dubious \u2013 discuss] a leading role in Kishore Sahu's Kali Ghata (1951), which became her film debut, and also featured Kishore Sahu in the lead role. In the 1950s, she married actor Prem Nath, whose sister Krishna was married to the actor-director Raj Kapoor, was part of the Kapoor family. They had acted together in some films, the first movie in which he was paired with Bina Rai was Aurat (1953), a Bollywood version of the tragic Biblical tale of Samson and Delilah (1949). The film was not a hit, but Bina Rai and Prem Nath fell in love with each other. They married and soon set up their own production unit, known as P.N. Films. Their first film from P.N. Films was Shagufa (1954) and they had pinned high hopes on it, but audiences rejected it. Neither Bina Rai's elfin charm nor Prem Nath's sensitive portrayal of the role of a doctor could save \"Shagufa\" from being a flop. And the films that followed \"Shagufa\" \u2013 Prisoner of Golconda, Samunder and Watan disappeared almost as soon as they hit the theatre screens. Thus the Prem Nath-Bina Rai pairing never clicked on the screen. However, her films with leading man Pradeep Kumar remain her best-remembered performances, where she played the title role in Anarkali (1953), Taj Mahal and Ghunghat for which she won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress In the 1970s, her son Prem Krishen became an actor and had one big hit Dulhan Wohi Jo Piya Man Bhaye (1977), but couldn't sustain the momentum so he turned producer, with the Cinevista banner, which went on produce TV series such as Kathasagar, Gul Gulshan Gulfam and Junoon. He launched his daughter Akanksha Malhotra as an actress in 2002 in his home production, claiming that she reminds him so much of his mother Bina Rai. Bina Rai stopped acting in films many years ago, claiming that women of a certain age don't get good roles. She also talks fondly of her husband Prem Nath who had died on 3 November 1992. In 2002, their son, Kailash (Monty) Nath released a tribute album, to his father on the occasion of his 10th death anniversary and 76th birth anniversary, titled Amar Premnath, released by Saregama. His grandson, Siddharth Malhotra directed the successful TV series on doctors, Sanjivani (2004). Bina Rai died on 6 December 2009, following a cardiac arrest. She was survived by her two sons, Prem Kishen and Kailash (Monty), and grandchildren Sidharth and Akansha. Prem Kishen had a shot term career as a film actor before shifting to film and television production, Cinevistaas Limited.

Her father, Hirak, is a civil engineer, and her mother, Mamta, is a homemaker. She has one elder sister, Bidisha, and one younger sister, Vijayeta. According to Basu, her name means \"dark deep desire\", and is also a river's name. She added \"Due to my dusky skin, I was considered ugly in my younger years.\" In Delhi, Basu lived at Pamposh Enclave, Nehru Place, till the age of eight and studied at Apeejay High School. Her family then shifted to Kolkata, where she attended Bhavan's Gangabux Kanoria Vidyamandir, located in Bidhannagar. In her school, Basu was appointed as the head girl and was fondly called 'Lady Goonda' due to her short and commanding personality. She remarked \"As a child, I was a tomboy and I was pampered a lot, due to which I became very naughty. I used to keep a stick in my hand and straighten out all the colony boys if they acted smart. I used to be very short as a child and I was the monitor in school. When the tall boys would be up to mischief, I'd jump on their back during breaks and pull their hair and beat them up\". Basu was enrolled in medical science studies until twelfth standard, but switched to commerce thereafter. In 1996, Basu was spotted at a hotel in Kolkata by the model Mehr Jesia Rampal, who suggested she take up modelling. That year, she participated in and eventually won the Godrej Cinthol Supermodel Contest (organised by Ford), thereby representing India at Ford Models Supermodel of the World contest in Miami. She later appeared in the Calida commercial with her then-boyfriend Dino Morea, which was controversial for picturing them sultrily; she had some protesters outside her house after that. With appearance on several magazine covers, Basu continued to pursue a career in fashion modeling during her late teens, until she became an actress. One of the judges of the Godrej Cinthol Supermodel Contest in which Basu participated, Vinod Khanna, wanted to launch her alongside his son Akshaye Khanna in Himalay Putra, but she felt she was too young and declined the role, which eventually went to Anjala Zaveri. After returning home, she was convinced by Jaya Bachchan to star opposite her son Abhishek Bachchan in J. P. Dutta's Aakhari Mughal. However, the film was cancelled, and Dutta instead changed the script and made Refugee with Kareena Kapoor. Basu was also offered a role in Refugee opposite Sunil Shetty, which she declined. In 2001, Basu finally made her debut opposite Akshay Kumar in Vijay Galani's Ajnabee. The film, directed by Abbas-Mustan, was inspired by the American film Consenting Adults. It was a moderate box-office success and attracted unfavorable reviews from critics. However, Basu's performance in a negative role was appreciated by critics and won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. In 2002, Basu starred in the year's most successful thriller, Raaz. Directed by Vikram Bhatt, it established Basu in the Hindi film industry. Her portrayal of a woman who is pursued by a spirit received positive reviews.

She was appreciated in a supporting role in Sanjay Gadhvi's Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai, a moderate critical and commercial success. However, in David Dhawan's Chor Machaaye Shor, was her first commercial failure. She appeared in a supporting role opposite Mahesh Babu and Lisa Ray in the Telugu film, Takkari Donga. Gunaah, which released later that year, was also a box-office failure. She played the role of a cop who loves a convict and tries to reform him. Derek Elley of Variety observed that Basu was a miscast as the \"idealistic cop\". In 2003, Basu starred in Pooja Bhatt's erotic thriller film, Jism alongside John Abraham, which was well received by critics and fared well at the box office. She played the role of seductive, ambitious wife of a millionaire who indulges in an extramarital affair with an alcoholic lawyer and plots to kill her husband. The film ranked 92 in the top 100 sexiest movie scenes poll conducted by Channel 4. Film critic Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama commented, \"... the real show stealer is Bipasha Basu; her sexy look and seductive deep voice, in contrast with her cold and calculating personality, makes her the most impressive femme fatale since Zeenat Aman and Parveen Babi.\" She received a Filmfare Best Villain Award nomination for Jism. Her next release, Zameen, failed to make impact among audiences. Basu had four releases in 2004, all of which performed moderately and drew mixed reviews. She collaborated for the second time with Vikram Bhatt in her first release Aetbaar. She played the role of a young woman who falls in love with a psychopath. Rediff.com noted that \"... The characters are not convincing, the plot is not fast-paced or interesting.\" Her next film was Mani Shankar's Rudraksh, based on the Indian epic Ramayana. The film was a disaster at the box office and was panned by the critics. She then starred in Rakht as a tarot card reader trying to solve a murder mystery. Critic Shruti Bhasin of Planetbollywood wrote, \"Bipasha Basu impresses in a different look and role.\" Her final release that year was Anil Sharma's Madhoshi opposite John Abraham. Her performance of a mentally unstable woman was generally well received. In 2005, she appeared in the love triangle Barsaat alongside Bobby Deol and Priyanka Chopra. Taran Adarsh commented, \"As an actor, she [Bipasha Basu] does show sparks only towards the end.\" She starred in the Tamil film, Sachein, which was a hit and then in Prakash Jha's Apaharan, which won the National Film Award for Best Screenplay. In this period, she refused to act in art films due to salary problems. Besides acting, Basu did the video \"Tu\" for Sonu Nigam's album, Kismat. She made a guest appearance in Jay Sean's music video \"Stolen\". Basu established herself as an actress with the success of No Entry, Corporate and Dhoom 2. No Entry grossed 750\u00a0million at the box office and was the highest-grossing film of 2005. Basu played the role of a bargirl who acts as wife of two men. She earned a Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination for the film. 2006 saw her star in four major releases\u00a0\u2014 Phir Hera Pheri, Corporate, Omkara and Dhoom 2\u00a0\u2014 performing well critically and commercially. Phir Hera Pheri became the ninth highest-grossing film of the year. She was featured opposite Akshay Kumar in a significant role of a con woman who steals 10 million from the protagonists. In Madhur Bhandarkar's Corporate, she gave up her glamorous look for the role of a businesswoman who has no qualms in taking advantage of her sexuality to con the CEO of a rival company. She won accolades from critics for her performance. Critic Aparna wrote, \"[...] she has done a fabulous job as an ambitious woman. The kind of shrewdness in a woman that she plays has never been seen before in India films.\" She was nominated for the second time for Filmfare Best Actress Award. In Vishal Bharadwaj's adaptation of Othello, Omkara, Basu played the role of Bianca and was a cameo. She caught the attention of public with her dance number \"Beedi\", which was highly popular in India and overseas. Critic Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN wrote, \"... Bipasha Basu is brought in to lend oomph and she succeeds in doing just that.\" Basu became the talk of the town for donning a bikini in Aditya Chopra's Dhoom 2. She reportedly ate only oranges for three days and trained hard to shoot the scene. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India commented, \"Aah Bipasha! Looks great, brings back the bikini to Bollywood, and gently slips into the shadows as a pretty accessory.\" In 2007, Ronnie Screwvala's Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal performed below average at the box-office. The song picturised on John Abraham and Basu, \"Billo Rani\", became quite popular and earned her the nickname \"Billo Rani\", though equal credit must be given to Omkara in which her name was Billo Chamanbahar. In 2008, she teamed up once again with Abbas-Mustan for Race. She played the role of Sonia who is stuck in a love-triangle between two brothers (played by Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna) and, through the course, she murders one of them. The film grossed 680\u00a0million at the box office and was the fourth-biggest hit that year in India; it performed good enough overseas as well. Her performance was appreciated by critics with Taran Adarsh citing it as \"her best work so far. She's superb.\" Basu's work in Siddharth Anand's Bachna Ae Haseeno as a successful supermodel who finds it hard to forgive her ex-lover for betraying her earned her a second nomination for Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award and the film was a commercial success with it becoming a \"Hit\". She completed 2008 by appearing during the song \"Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte\" in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. Her first release in 2009, Aa Dekhen Zara failed to do well at the box office. Rohit Shetty's All The Best: Fun Begins performed well and her comic role was appreciated by fans. Later that year, Basu surprised everybody with Rituparno Ghosh's Bengali film, Shob Charitro Kalponik. \"I love saris and I'm wearing a lot of them in Ritu's film,\" she said. She gave up her glamorous look and was praised by critics for her performance. Critic Subhash K. Jha spoke high of her. He said, \"Bipasha [Basu] pulls out all stops to deliver her career's best performance. Her moments of anguish before and after her screen-husband's death are expressed in tones of cathartic conviction that we never knew existed within Bipasha.\" He also compared her with the multiple-award-winning actress, Shabana Azmi, commenting that Basu's anguished portrayal of bereavement can be equalled by Azmi only. With the 2010 film Pankh, Basu returned as an imaginary character who exists in the protagonist\u2019s mind. She was then featured as a Kashmiri girl in Rahul Dholakia's Lamhaa, which explored socio-political problems in Kashmir. Principal photography of Lamhaa was disrupted many times by the locals due to the controversial theme. During the shooting of Lamhaa, she left the sets at Anantnag and headed back to Mumbai citing she was afraid of the crowd there. Producer Bunty Walia thought of replacing her with Vidya Balan, but she returned for the shoot later with necessary security arrangements. NDTV Movies wrote, \"Bipasha sinks herself into her character imparting a dramatic resonance into the role without resorting to stock expressions. The sequence where she gets mauled by militant women is as traumatic to watch as it must have been for Bipasha to shoot.\" Basu then appeared as the wife of a ruthless cop in Priyadarshan's Aakrosh who helps the police with investigation on honour killings in their village. She met with mixed reviews for the film. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India commented, \"Bipasha actually doesn't have much to do and does seem to be miscast as the much-abused, bruised and battered wife of Paresh Rawal.\" Her only release in 2011 was Dum Maaro Dum, which performed reasonably well at the box office and met with good reviews from critics. Talking of the film, she said, \"My next release is DMD Dum Maaro Dum, in which I play a lively, colourful, happy-go-lucky girl called Zoey, who is the representation of Goa as we see it.\" Basu collaborated with Abbas-Mustan for the third time in Players, which became the first release of 2012. The film was an official remake of The Italian Job. Players was heavily compared to The Italian Job and was criticised for its execution and performances, including that of Basu. Her next release was Raaz 3, a supernatural horror thriller directed by Vikram Bhatt, upon release met with favourable response and emerging as a box office success after a period of relatively low phase for Basu. The movie not only became the highest grossing horror film, but also emerged a \"blockbuster\" with revenues of \u20b9730 million (US$11\u00a0million) in India alone. Her performance in the film garnered acclaim from critics with Subhash K. Jha of IANS saying, \"It's Bipasha who holds together the feverish proceedings. She delivers a full-bodied gutsy performance.\" After appearing in a guest appearance in Race 2, where she reprised her role from the prequel, Basu was seen in the horror film Aatma which was directed by Suparn Verma and produced by Kumar Mangat and Abhishek Pathak. She received mixed reviews for the movie. Bipasha performed live alongside Atif Aslam, Shaan & Malaika Arora Khan for the first time in series of concerts in Birmingham & London. in summer 2013. In 2014 Bipasha Basu was seen on numerous roles in different types of movies. She appeared in Humshakals a movie Directed by Sajid Khan opposite to Saif Ali Khan which was a box office disaster. She even didn't participate in the film's promotions because she was \"extremely disturbed by the end result\" and stated, \"Humshakals was the worst experience of my life.\" She was also seen in a special 3D movie by Vikram Bhatt produced by Bhushan Kumar titled Creature 3D, which was again a box office failure. Basu has completed work on her first English film, Roland Joff\u00e9's epic drama The Lovers in which she will portray a Maratha warrior. The film was released on 13 March 2015. In 2015, Basu featured in Bhushan Patel's romance horror film, Alone opposite her future husband Karan Singh Grover.India TV reviewed the movie Alone when it released and wrote that \"With some genuine scary moments and Bipasha-Karan's scorching chemistry, Alone stands apart from numerous horrible horror flicks made in the past.\" and also stated that \"Bipasha just takes her act to another level.\" Basu ranked 8 in The Times of India' 50 most desirable women in 2011, ranked 13 in 2012, and ranked 7 in 2013. UK magazine Eastern Eye named her the \"Sexiest Woman in Asia\" in 2005 and 2007. Bipasha is few of the actresses who have been in the industry for more than 15 years.

        "biography": " Bobby Deol (born Vijay Singh Deol; 27 January 1969 ) is an Indian actor. Deol is the son of Bollywood actor Dharmendra and the brother of Sunny Deol, also a successful actor in the Indian film industry. Deol has mostly acted in thriller films, often playing antiheroic characters who are forced to commit crime to avenge the deaths of loved ones. Examples of such films include Badal, Gupt, Jurm and Bichhoo. His films commonly involve themes of jealousy, deceit and revenge and his more romantic thrillers often involve him caught in love triangles. Some of his successful films are Barsaat (1995), Gupt (1997), Soldier (1998), Badal (2000), Bichhoo (2000), Ajnabee (2001), Humraaz (2002), Apne (2007), and Yamla Pagla Deewana (2011). Deol was awarded the Filmfare Best Debut Award for his role in the 1995 film Barsaat and was later nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for his performance in Humraaz in 2002. Apart from acting, Deol owns a successful restaurants in Mumbai and a banquet hall that serves 2000 people.   Deol was born into a Punjabi Jatt family in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, in 1969 the second son of Bollywood Star Dharmendra and Prakash Kaur. He is the younger brother of Sunny Deol and also has two sisters Vijayta and Ajeeta who are settled in California. His step-mother is Hema Malini, through whom he has two paternal half-sisters, actress Esha Deol and Ahana Deol. His cousin Abhay Deol is also an actor. He completed his schooling from Jamnbai Narsee School and then graduated from Mithibai College - Commerce. Deol first briefly appeared as a child actor in the film Dharam Veer in 1977. Deol then made his adult debut with Twinkle Khanna in the 1995 Bollywood film Barsaat, directed by Rajkumar Santoshi. Deol plays the character of Badal , a naive but intelligent young man who moves from a small village to the big city and gets caught up with corrupt police and criminal gangs amidst falling in love. Partly shot in Scotland, Deol broke his leg in an equestrian accident while filming and had to be flown to London to recuperate and had to call off several publicity shoots which documented his debut. The film was nonetheless a considerable success and garnered him the Filmfare Best Debut Award. In 1997, Deol starred in Gupt: The Hidden Truth, a suspense thriller directed by Rajiv Rai, considered his breakthrough role. Cast alongside Manisha Koirala, Kajol, Paresh Rawal, Om Puri and Raj Babbar, Deol played the role of Sahil, a young man accused of murdering his stepfather over an engagement proposal and wrongly imprisoned. He escapes and tracks down the real killer. Gupt: The Hidden Truth was highly acclaimed for its storyline and soundtrack and was a major commercial success. In the same year, Deol appeared in Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya, alongside Aishwarya Rai in her debut Bollywood role. The film failed to do well at the box office. In 1998, Deol starred opposite Neha in the Vidhu Vinod Chopra film, Kareeb. Deol played the character of Birju, an irresponsible young man from an upper-middle-class family in Himachal Pradesh with a love of petty thievery and deceit. Later in 1998, he appeared in Abbas Mustan's military thriller Soldier, alongside Raakhee and Preity Zinta. Deol played the mysterious character of Vicky, later revealed as Raju, son of Vijay Malhotra who was convicted of arms smuggling. In 1999, Deol starred in Dillagi, directed by and co-starring his brother Sunny Deol. The film is noted for being the first time Sunny Deol directed a film and also the first time he acted alongside Bobby. This pairing was repeated in 23rd March 1931: Shaheed (2002), Apne (2007) and Yamla Pagla Deewana (2011). Dillagi features the two as the brothers Ranvir and Rajvir, fighting for the affection of Shalini (Urmila Matondkar). In 2000, Deol appeared in the action drama Badal alongside Rani Mukerji, under the director's helm of Raj Kanwar. The film is set in 1984 when riots were engulfing parts of Punjab and Delhi. Deol plays the character of Badal, a boy who witnesses the massacre of his family and villagers by the corrupt Police Inspector Jai Singh Rana (Ashutosh Rana) and grows up to be a dreaded terrorist, fueled by the anger and hatred of the authorities who wrongly deprived him of his family and friends. The film is inspired by The Devil's Own (1997), starring Brad Pitt and Harrison Ford. Following this he starred alongside Karisma Kapoor in Hum To Mohabbat Karega (2000), and reunited with Rani Mukerji to star in Bichhoo (2000), a blatant remake of Luc Besson's 1994 film Leon, starring Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. In Bichhoo, Deol plays Reno's role, Jeeva, a young man from a struggling middle-class family who has the misfortune of falling in love with the wealthy Kiran (Malaika Arora). Her cruel, disapproving father in rage at their relationship has Jeeva's mother and two sisters publicly arrested for prostitution, and eventually all three kill themselves. Jeeva becomes a professional killer and later extracts vengeance against Kiran's father and his henchmen. He and his neighbour Kiran Bali (Mukherjee) soon witness the entire Bali family get murdered. Jeeva now decides to help Kiran seek revenge on the men who killed her family. The film and Deol's performance was panned by the critics, with Sakanya Verna of Rediff.com citing the film as \"one of the most painful of the year\" and commenting, \"Bobby Deol's performance is quite, well, robotic. He religiously hangs on to a brooding expression right through the film. Why o why doesn't someone insist he goes to an acting school?\" In 2001 (although filmed in 2000), Deol starred alongside Karisma Kapoor and Rahul Dev in Indra Kumar's Aashiq. Following this, he featured in Abbas Burmawalla and Mustan Burmawalla's thriller, Ajnabee, alongside Kareena Kapoor, Akshay Kumar and Bipasha Basu. The film, adapted from the 1992 American thriller Consenting Adults, features Deol as Raj, the new husband of Priya Malhotra (Kapoor) who after moving to Switzerland and initially befriending their neighbours (Kumar and Basu), become entangled in a web of deceit and extra-marital activity. Ziya us Salaam of The Hindu was unconvinced with Deol's performance, remarking that he \"only occasionally manages to transmit fear of the fugitive.\" In 2002, Deol starred alongside his brother Sunny in the historical film 23rd March 1931: Shaheed. Set in British India, it depicts the events leading up to the hanging of Indian freedom fighter Bhagat Singh and his companions Rajguru and Sukhdev on 23 March 1931. The film stars Bobby Deol as Bhagat Singh and Sunny Deol as another revolutionary Chandra Shekhar Azad. The film received a mixed reception from critics, with some good reviews. Rediff.com believed the movie had plenty of good moments, and plenty of bad ones and believed the film was superior to that of the original on Bhagat Singh, although they believed the agony of Bhagat Singh's fight was underplayed, diminishing the brutality and anguish suffered in the real life event. While Deol was praised for some scenes, he was criticised for shouting and Rediff believed he was overshadowed by Ajay Devgan remarking, \"In terms of performance, Devgan is clearly the winner, with the advantage of a stronger script and a better director. Devgan, who reportedly lost weight to look the part, is today emerging as one of India's finest actors, willing to try out different roles. Deol tries his best, but it is difficult to shout and act simultaneously.\" Later in 2002, Deol was nominated for Filmfare Best Actor Award for his role as a suave, wealthy shipping businessman in Abbas-Mustan's romantic thriller Humraaz. The film is inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M For Murder (1954) (remade in 1998 as A Perfect Murder) and features Deol in a love triangle with Akshaye Khanna and Ameesha Patel. The film was generally praised by critics, with Chitra Mahesh of The Hindu saying, \"Bobby Deol spends the entire first half looking moony eyed and spaced out, but overcomes the stupor towards the end where he actually gives a good performance. Deol's final film of 2002 was David Dhawan's Chor Machaaye Shor in which he acted alongside Paresh Rawal, Shilpa Shetty, Bipasha Basu and Om Puri. He played Shyam, a small-time crook who gets his hands on some diamonds worth millions. In 2003, Deol took a hiatus from acting and returned to the screen in 2004 in Kismat opposite Priyanka Chopra. In Bardaasht, a drama based on the screenplay written by Vikram Bhatt, Deol starred alongside Lara Dutta and Rahul Dev as Aditya Shrivastav, a deserted army officer. The film deals with themes of police brutality and corruption and justice. Deol then played another army officer, a Lieutenant Commander in Anil Sharma's Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Saathiyo as Kunaljit Singh/Vikramjeet Singh. The film, which featured some prominent Bollywood actors such as Amitabh Bachchan (who played a general and Deol's father), and Akshay Kumar, it was arguably Deol's highest profile film to date but despite high box office expectations it was a commercial failure. His most famous role of all time was in Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Saathiyo, when he wore a pugh/turban. That gave him more of an audience from the Punjabi crowd, and inspired comments saying he looks better in a turban. In 2005, Deol starred in Vikram Bhatt's thriller Jurm as the wealthy businessman Avinash Malhotra who suspects his wife Sanjana (Lara Dutt) of having an affair with Rohit (Milind Soman). Deol's performance was praised by a number of critics, with Vivek Fernandes of Rediff.com remarking, \"Bobby Deol, Bhatt's schoolmate, does his alma mater proud with his controlled performance. There's a sense of maturity about his candour, which is good news.\" Deol then starred alongside Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Shetty and Ajay Devgan in Mani Shankar's war movie Tango Charlie as an Indian trooper named Tarun Chauhan of the 101st BSF Battalion, operating in the northeastern Indian province fighting Bodo militant in Upper Assam. He followed this role by featuring in Suneel Darshan's romance film Barsaat as the ambitious young Indian Arav, who, in living in the United States, becomes involved in a love triangle with beauties Priyanka Chopra and Bipasha Basu. The film was not a critical success, with Ziya us Salaam of The Hindu concluding, \"A moth-eaten love triangle with all the stereotypes Bollywood survives on \u2013 a devoted wife with her karva chauth ki thali, the other woman with her mini-skirts, a joint family, songs, festivities..... No shower of rejuvenation, this \"Barsaat\" is just drenched in mediocrity.\" She was equally unimpressed with Deol's performance, remarking, \"The girls are ready with their curls and curves, the guy just appears lost, making you wonder if Bobby has grown even an inch as an actor since he made his debut in Rajkumar Santoshi's film by the same name.\" His final role of 2005 was as Karan in Dosti: Friends Forever, opposite Akshay Kumar, Lara Dutta, Kareena Kapoor, and Juhi Chawla. He once again plays a wealthy businessman but is down on his luck with his finances and romancing women. The film, although performing below average in India was a major success in the United Kingdom, where it became the highest grosser of Bollywood in 2005, grossing around \u00a3888,000. In 2006, Deol starred in the romantic musical film Humko Tumse Pyaar Hai. Deol played Raj, a character who falls in love with Durga (Amisha Patel), a beautiful blind woman with a talent for shaping pottery, but faces competition from Rohit (Arjun Rampal). Deol and Patel have been labelled as the \"Bollywood equivalent of Hugh Grant and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger\". Although the film received a mixed reception, a number of critics praised Deol's performance as Raj, with Taran Adarsh commenting, \"Bobby Deol is only getting better as an actor. He manages to register an impact in a film that belongs to Amisha and Arjun primarily.\" Later that year, he made a brief special appearance in Alag in the song Sabse Alag. In 2007, Deol starred in 6 films. The first of them, Shakalaka Boom Boom, was shot in South Africa and is based on conflicts and the power game involved in the functioning of the music industry, addressing the themes of envy, jealousy, insecurity, anxiety, manipulation and anger. The film, which featured Bobby alongside Upen Patel, Kangana Ranaut and Celina Jaitly was generally praised by critics, especially for its choreography, and Deol received some very positive reviews. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM.com said after viewing the film, \"Both Bobby and Upen get fabulous roles and the two actors make the most of it. Bobby is one of the most under-rated actors around. His work has been consistent all through, but one tends to overlook this talented actor's abilities all the while. Watch him go negative in Shakalaka Boom Boom and you'd agree that he's amongst the best in the business today. His outburst in the end is remarkable.\" Deol's second film of 2007 was Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, which saw him play the character of Steve/Satvinder Singh opposite Abhishek Bachchan (who played a gypsy in London), Preity Zinta, and Lara Dutta. Directed by Shaad Ali, the film was produced by Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra under the Yash Raj Films banner. The film was not critically acclaimed and was mostly criticised by what critics believed was a shallow screenplay. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM.com gave the film a 1.5 out of 5 rating, saying, \"the film is all gloss, no substance\". He also believed that Deol was overshadowed by his co-stars, remarking that the film, \"belongs to Abhishek first and Preity next\". Deol next starred in the boxing drama Apne. The film was a family affair, featuring Bobby Deol alongside his father Dharmendra, a disgraced retired boxer who trains Bobby and his brother (Sunny Deol) to become champion boxers but in doing so creates a rift within the family. Apne was a major commercial success, particularly in northern India and overseas, especially in the UK, where it made \u00a3579,457 on the opening weekend, entering into the UK. Top Ten at Number 3. Deol next starred in the suspense thriller Naqaab, another Abbas-Mustan film which features him alongside Akshaye Khanna and Urvashi Sharma as another millionaire caught in a love triangle. Deol received a mixed reception for his performance. For instance, Raja Sen of Rediff.com praised several of his scenes, remarking, \"Bobby gets a considerably meaty role, and there are a couple of moments when he genuinely works the audience\", but describes his character as \"sensitive to an annoying hilt\". This film was followed by brief special appearances as himself in Om Shanti Om and Nanhe Jaisalmer. In 2008, Deol starred opposite Priyanka Chopra, Danny Denzongpa and Irrfan Khan in the crime drama Chamku, playing the lead character and titlesake of Chamku, a man raised by Baba (Denzongpa), a Naxal leader based in the southern interiors of Bihar, after his family was brutally murdered. He is assigned by a covert governmental program jointly conceived by RAW and Intelligence Bureau to carry out political assassinations but after falling in love with the kindergarten teacher Shubhi (Chopra), he decides to lead a reformed life but is later tempted to turn to crime again. Kabeer Kaushik, the director of the film had originally approached Deol to play the lead role in his debut film, Sehar, but despite liking the script, Deol turned it down because at the time he was not prepared to work with a debutant director. Deol next featured in Heroes as an army officer and Dhananjay \"DJ\" Shergill alongside a strong cast which included Salman Khan, Preity Zinta, Sunny Deol and Mithun Chakraborty. Although initially set to be released on 6 June 2008, it was pushed to 24 October 2008, the opening weekend of the holiday Diwali. Much of the filming took place in northern India, including Ladakh (notably Pangong Tso), Chandigarh, Punjab, and Delhi. Deol's last role in 2008 was in the film Dostana, as Abhimanyu Singh, supporting role to the films' main stars Abhishek Bachchan, John Abraham and Priyanka Chopra under the Dharma Productions banner. The film explores the story of two men who pretend to be gay but both fall in love with the same girl, their roommate. Dostana is the first Bollywood film to be filmed entirely in Miami, United States and went on to become the eighth highest grossing film at the Indian Box Office in 2008. In 2009, Deol portrayed Nandu, an orphan turned assassin wrongly accused of a politician's murder in the movie Ek: The Power of One. Deol's next film titled, Help, was shot in Mauritius, in which he appeared opposite Mugdha Godse. The film was released on 13 August 2010. Deol then starred in Yamla Pagla Deewana which was released on 14 January 2011. He later starred in the film Thank You opposite Sonam Kapoor. His character is a businessman who is not sincere with his wife. In 2012, he appeared in heist film Players. The film proved to be a failure at the box office. He played the role of Ronnie, who has no experience in conning people, but is a master of illusions. He was one of the most popular illusionists who abandoned magic after a tragic incident. Deol's latest film is Yamla Pagla Deewana 2, the sequel to his 2011 hit. YPD 2 didn't make a big impression at the box office, and flopped. Bobby Deol is set to make his comeback in 2017 with Shreyas Talpade's directorial venture Poster Boys alongside his brother Sunny Deol."

        "artist_name": "Deepika_Padukone", 
        "biography": " Deepika Padukone (pronounced\u00a0[d\u032ai\u02d0p\u026aka\u02d0 p\u0259\u0256\u028ako\u02d0\u0273]; born 5 January 1986) is an Indian film actress. One of the highest-paid actresses in the world, Padukone is the recipient of several awards, including three Filmfare Awards. She features in listings of the nation's most popular and attractive personalities. Padukone, the daughter of the badminton player Prakash Padukone, was born in Copenhagen and raised in Bangalore. As a teenager, she played badminton in national level championships but left her career in the sport to become a fashion model. She soon received offers for film roles and made her acting debut in 2006 as the title character of the Kannada film Aishwarya. Padukone then played a dual role in her first Bollywood release\u2014the 2007 blockbuster Om Shanti Om\u2014and won a Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. Padukone received praise for portraying the lead roles in the romance Love Aaj Kal (2009) and the drama Lafangey Parindey (2010), but her performances in the romance Bachna Ae Haseeno (2008) and the comedy Housefull (2010) were met with negative reviews. The 2012 box office hit Cocktail marked a turning point in Padukone's career, earning her praise and Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies. She rose to prominence with starring roles in the romantic comedies Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013) and Chennai Express (2013), the heist comedy Happy New Year (2014), and the historical romance Bajirao Mastani (2015), all of which rank among the highest-grossing Bollywood films. Padukone's acclaimed portrayal of a character based on Juliet in the tragic romance Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela (2013) and a headstrong architect in the comedy-drama Piku (2015) won her two Best Actress awards at Filmfare. Her first project in Hollywood came with the action film xXx: Return of Xander Cage (2017). Alongside her acting career, Padukone participates in stage shows, has written columns for an Indian newspaper, is a prominent celebrity endorser for brands and products, and is vocal about issues such as feminism and depression. She has designed her own line of clothing for women and is the founder of The Live Love Laugh Foundation, which creates awareness on mental health in India.   Deepika Padukone was born on 5 January 1986 in Copenhagen, Denmark to Konkani-speaking parents. Her father, Prakash, is a former badminton player of international repute, and her mother, Ujjala, is a travel agent. Her younger sister, Anisha, is a golfer. Her paternal grandfather, Ramesh, was a secretary of the Mysore Badminton Association. The family relocated to Bangalore, India when Padukone was a year old. She was educated at Bangalore's Sophia High School and completed her pre-university education at Mount Carmel College. She subsequently enrolled at the Indira Gandhi National Open University for a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology but later quit it due to scheduling conflicts with her modelling career. Padukone has admitted to being socially awkward as a child and did not have many friends. The focus of her life was badminton, which she played competitively from a young age. Describing her daily routine in a 2012 interview, Padukone said, \"I would wake up at five in the morning, go for physical training, go to school, again go for playing badminton, finish my homework, and go to sleep.\" Padukone continued to pursue a career in badminton throughout her school years and played the sport in national level championships. She also played baseball in a few state level tournaments. While concentrating on her education and sporting career, Padukone also worked as a child model, first appearing in a couple of advertising campaigns at the age of eight. In the tenth grade, she changed focus and decided to become a fashion model. She later explained, \"I realised that I was playing the game only because it ran in the family. So, I asked my father if I could give up the game and he wasn't upset at all.\" In 2004, she began a full-time career as a model under the tutelage of Prasad Bidapa. Early in her career, Padukone gained recognition with a television commercial for the soap Liril and modelled for various other brands and products. In 2005, she made her runway debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Suneet Varma and won the \"Model of the Year\" award at the Kingfisher Fashion Awards. Padukone's fame increased when she appeared in a highly popular print campaign for the 2006 Kingfisher Calendar; the designer Wendell Rodricks commented, \"Since Aishwarya Rai, we haven't had a girl as beautiful and fresh.\" Rodricks had spotted her at a Ganjam jewellery class he was teaching and signed her up with the Matrix agency. At the age of 21, Padukone relocated to Mumbai and stayed at her aunt's home. That year, she gained wider recognition by featuring in the music video for Himesh Reshammiya's song \"Naam Hai Tera.\" Padukone soon began to receive offers for film roles. Believing herself to be too inexperienced as an actor, she instead enrolled for a course at Anupam Kher's film academy. Following much media speculation, the director Farah Khan, who had noticed her in Reshammiya's music video, made the decision to cast her for a role in Happy New Year. Padukone announced in 2006 that she would make her film debut with Aishwarya, a Kannada film directed by Indrajit Lankesh. The romantic comedy was a remake of the Telugu film Manmadhudu, and she was cast in the title role opposite the actor Upendra. The film proved a major commercial success. RG Vijayasarathy of Rediff.com was appreciative of Padukone's screen presence but added that \"she needs to work on her emotional scenes.\" By the end of 2006, Farah Khan's Happy New Year was shelved, and Khan had instead cast Padukone for the reincarnation melodrama Om Shanti Om (2007). Set against the backdrop of the Hindi film industry, the film tells the story of a struggling actor in the 1970s who dies soon after witnessing the murder of the woman he loved and is reincarnated to avenge her death. Shah Rukh Khan starred as the protagonist, and Padukone featured in dual roles\u2014Shantipriya, a leading actress of the 1970s, and later as Sandy, an aspiring actress. She said, \"I've grown up watching [Shah Rukh] and always admired him so much. To get to work with him\u00a0... is quite wonderful. It was also fantastic that Farah showed faith in my talent and cast me opposite him.\" In preparation for her role, Padukone watched several films of actresses Helen and Hema Malini to study their body language, which she felt \"were more graceful\" and \"completely different from today's actors.\" However, her voice was dubbed by the voice artist Mona Ghosh Shetty. For one of the songs in the film, \"Dhoom Taana,\u201d Padukone drew upon Indian classical dance, and according to Dorling Kindersley, \"mesmeriz[ed] audiences\" by using hasta mudras (hand gestures). Om Shanti Om was a commercial success, and emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year, with a global revenue of \u20b91.49 billion (US$23\u00a0million). Taran Adarsh of the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama reviewed, \"Deepika has all it takes to be a top star\u2014the personality, the looks and yes, she's supremely talented too. Standing in the same frame as [Shah Rukh] and getting it right is no small achievement. She comes as a whiff of fresh air!\" At the annual Filmfare Awards ceremony, Padukone was awarded the Best Female Debut Award and received her first nomination in the Best Actress category. Bollywood Hungama reported that the success of Om Shanti Om proved a breakthrough for Padukone. She followed this success with the role of Gayatri (one of star Ranbir Kapoor's love interests), a feisty student in Australia who moonlights as a cab driver in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Bachna Ae Haseeno (2008). The film was a financial success, but Namrata Joshi of Outlook wrote that Padukone's performance was disappointing; \"She is mannequin-like and utterly lacks fire and zing.\" Padukone's first release of 2009 came alongside Akshay Kumar in the Nikhil Advani-directed kung fu comedy Chandni Chowk To China, in which she portrayed the dual roles of Indian-Chinese twin sisters Sakhi and Suzy. Produced by Warner Bros., it had one of the widest international releases ever given to an Indian film. Padukone learned the Japanese martial art form of jujutsu and performed her stunts without the use of a body double. Despite the hype, Chandni Chowk To China proved a major financial failure with worldwide earnings of \u20b9554.7 million (US$8.6\u00a0million) on a budget of \u20b9800 million (US$12\u00a0million). Film critics were generally disappointed with the picture and Padukone's performance; Justin Trout of Orlando Weekly noted, \"She is so wasted in Chandni Chowk, my mind often wandered back to Om Shanti Om during her scenes, possibly as a defense mechanism.\" That same year, Padukone featured in an item number (for a song called \"Love Mera Hit Hit\") in the drama Billu, following which she appeared alongside Saif Ali Khan in the romantic drama Love Aaj Kal from the writer-director Imtiaz Ali. The film documented the changing value of relationships among the youth and had Padukone play the part of Meera Pandit, a head-strong career woman. With a worldwide gross of \u20b91.2 billion (US$19\u00a0million), Love Aaj Kal proved to be the third highest-grossing film of 2009. Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis said that Padukone \"delivers the best of her four performances so far\" and Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India mentioned her as \"definitive and strong.\" At the 55th Filmfare Awards Padukone received a nomination for Best Actress. Padukone had five film releases in 2010. Her first role was in Vijay Lalwani's psychological thriller Karthik Calling Karthik, where Padukone was cast as the supportive girlfriend of a depressed man (played by Farhan Akhtar) who goes through a series of changes after receiving mysterious phone calls every morning. Derek Elley of Variety found the film to be \"thinly plotted\" but added that \"the uncomplicated ingenuousness of Padukone\u00a0... helps make the tall tale convincing.\" Commercially, the film performed poorly. Her most economically profitable film that year was Sajid Khan's \u20b91.15 billion (US$18\u00a0million)-grossing comedy film Housefull in which she featured alongside an ensemble cast including Akshay Kumar, Ritesh Deshmukh, Lara Dutta, Arjun Rampal, Jiah Khan, and Boman Irani. Raja Sen described the film as a \"festival of bad acting\" and attributed Padukone's poor performance to her \"plasticky expressions.\" Pradeep Sarkar's drama Lafangey Parindey (2010) saw Padukone star opposite Neil Nitin Mukesh in the role of Pinky Palkar, a blind girl determined to win a skating competition. In preparation for her role, she observed the interactions of blind people and rehearsed scenes while blindfolded. Writing for The Hindu, Sudhish Kamath was particularly impressed by Padukone and wrote that she \"exercises considerable restraint\" in playing her part. Later that year, Hindustan Times published that the film helped change people's perception of Padukone, with focus directed on her acting prowess rather than her appearance. Her next role was opposite Imran Khan in the Danish Aslam-directed romantic comedy Break Ke Baad. CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand found the film to be \"reasonably engaging\" and noted that it was \"watchable largely for the performance of its leading lady.\" Both Lafangey Parindey and Break Ke Baad underperformed at the box office. Padukone's final release of 2010 was Ashutosh Gowarikar's period film Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey opposite Abhishek Bachchan. Based on the book Do and Die by Manini Chatterjee, the film is a retelling of the 1930 Chittagong armoury raid. Bachchan featured as the revolutionary leader Surya Sen and Padukone played Kalpana Dutta, his confidante. Padukone said that she did not research for the role as there were \"hardly\u00a0... any reference points as to what Kalpana looked like other than a few photos,\" and relied completely on Gowarikar's direction. A review published in The Telegraph was appreciative of Padukone's portrayal, and the film received a generally positive critical reception. Despite this, it proved a major commercial disappointment. Padukone began 2011 with an item number in Rohan Sippy's Dum Maaro Dum. The song was a remixed version of the iconic song \"Dum Maro Dum,\" from the 1971 film Hare Rama Hare Krishna, which featured Zeenat Aman. Padukone referred to it as \"the wildest song any actress has done;\" the song's \"suggestive lyrics\" and \"raunchy moves\" attracted controversy including a court case for indecency. Her next film was Prakash Jha's socio-political drama Aarakshan, co-starring Amitabh Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, Manoj Bajpayee and Prateik Babbar, which dealt with the political issue of caste-based reservations in India. Trade journalists had high expectations for the film which ultimately flopped at the box office. Critical reaction was largely negative, though Pratim D. Gupta mentioned Padukone as the most \"refreshing thing about [the] movie.\" Her final appearance that year was in Rohit Dhawan's comedy-drama Desi Boyz alongside Akshay Kumar, John Abraham and Chitrangada Singh, a role that failed to propel her career forward. The series of poorly received films led critics to perceive that Padukone had \"[lost] her sparkle.\" In an interview for The Indian Express, Padukone said that her starring role in the 2012 Homi Adajania-directed romantic comedy Cocktail marked a significant turning point in her career. Raja Sen of Rediff.com opined that she had successfully proved to be a \"stunning girl who can also act.\" Set in London, Cocktail tells the story of a software engineer (played by Saif Ali Khan) and his relationship with two temperamentally different women\u2014an impulsive party girl (Veronica, played by Padukone) and a submissive girl next door (Meera, played by Diana Penty). During the script narration, the producer Dinesh Vijan offered Padukone the choice of which woman to play; she decided on Veronica to expand her horizons as an actress. Portraying the role was a creative and physical challenge for her, and to achieve the physical requirements of her character she exercised extensively and followed a rigorous diet. Critics were divided in their opinion of the film, but particularly praised Padukone's performance; Devesh Sharma of Filmfare credited her as the \"soul of the film\" and wrote that she \"excels in every scene, whether as a material girl who enjoys sex, drugs and rock and roll or as the jealousy ridden girl out to destroy herself.\" Cocktail earned Padukone Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies, including Filmfare, Screen, and IIFA. The film proved a box office hit as well. In 2013, Padukone established herself as a leading actress of contemporary Hindi cinema by featuring in four of the top-grossing productions of the year. She collaborated with Saif Ali Khan for the fourth time (alongside John Abraham, Jacqueline Fernandez, Ameesha Patel, and Anil Kapoor) in Abbas-Mustan's Race 2, an ensemble action thriller that served as a sequel to the 2008 film Race. The film received predominantly negative reviews from critics, but with a total collection of \u20b91.62 billion (US$25\u00a0million), it proved to be a commercial success. In a particularly scathing review, Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV wrote that both Padukone and Fernandez \"strut around like wound-up automatons that are all decked-up but have nowhere to go.\" Ayan Mukerji's romantic comedy Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani was Padukone's next film release. Co-starring alongside Ranbir Kapoor, Kalki Koechlin, and Aditya Roy Kapoor, she was cast as Naina Talwar, a \"shy wallflower,\" which marked a departure from the glamorous characters that she had a reputation for portraying. Film critics praised Padukone's performance, though their response to the film was mixed. Raja Sen thought that the film \"lacked a good story\" but added that Padukone \"acts within herself and eschews exaggeration, and the results are impressive\u00a0... This may be her most self-aware performance so far\". The pairing of Padukone with her former boyfriend was highly anticipated, and the film proved a major success with a worldwide revenue of \u20b93.02 billion (US$47\u00a0million). Her next appearance was opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Rohit Shetty's action-comedy film Chennai Express. She played Meenalochini Azhagusundaram, a Tamil girl on the run from her father (a local don), which required that she adopt a Tamil accent. Critical opinion on her accent was mixed, but her performance received praise; film critic Aseem Chhabra concluded, \"Padukone is delightful in the film\u2014beautiful, smiling, and often a lot more playful and funny than Khan.\" Chennai Express was Padukone's second consecutive release to earn over \u20b93 billion (US$46\u00a0million) in worldwide ticket sales; both Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani and Chennai Express rank among the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time. Padukone next played opposite Ranveer Singh in Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, an adaptation of the Shakespearean tragedy of Romeo and Juliet from director Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Her role was Leela, a Gujarati girl based on the character of Juliet. Initially titled Ram-Leela, the film's title was changed after a court case was registered against Bhansali, Padukone, and Singh for \"offending the religious sentiments\" of the Hindu community by showcasing sex and violence under a title that referred to the life of Lord Rama. Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela released among protests across several states in India, but was generally well received by critics. Meena Iyer of The Times of India mentioned Padukone as \"breathtaking\", and writing for Deccan Chronicle, Khalid Mohamed concluded that \"it\u2019s Deepika Padukone whom the film belongs to. Looking drop dead gorgeous and going at her part with a wallop, she\u2019s the prime asset of Ram-Leela.\" The film earned \u20b92.02 billion (US$31\u00a0million) worldwide, making it Padukone's fourth consecutive box office hit of the year. Her performances in Chennai Express and Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela won her several awards, including the Screen Award for Best Actress for both films and the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for the latter. In 2014, Padukone featured opposite Rajinikanth in the Tamil film Kochadaiiyaan, a period drama that was shot using motion capture technology. She was paid \u20b930 million (US$460,000) for two days worth of work in the film. In Homi Adajania's widely praised satire Finding Fanny, Padukone played a young widow who takes a road trip with her dysfunctional friends (played by Arjun Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah, Dimple Kapadia and Pankaj Kapur) in search of a woman named Fanny. The film was screened at the 19th Busan International Film Festival; critic Anuj Kumar of The Hindu wrote that Padukone successfully \"takes off the fineries of Bollywood and you can sense the freedom from baggage in her performance\". Later that year, she starred opposite Shah Rukh Khan for the third time in Farah Khan's renewal of Happy New Year. She played a bar dancer who trains a group of underachievers for a dance competition. Sanjukta Sharma of Mint found her role to be of minimal importance that required her only to be \"a pretty thing to be laughed at and pitied\", but the film became one of her most successful, earning over \u20b93.4 billion (US$53\u00a0million) worldwide. Following an appearance in an online video on feminism, entitled My Choice, under the direction of Homi Adajania, Padukone took on the role of a headstrong Bengali architect who cares for her hypochondriac father (played by Amitabh Bachchan), in Shoojit Sircar's comedy-drama Piku (2015). Reviews for the film were positive; Tanmaya Nanda of Business Standard praised the film's feminist tone, and wrote that Padukone proves \"what she is capable of when given something more to do than look pretty and be the crazy-dance girl at parties\". NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee opined that she \"holds Piku together with a restrained star turn\". With a worldwide gross of over \u20b91.40 billion (US$22\u00a0million), the film emerged as a box office hit, and garnered Padukone several awards, including second Best Actress awards at Filmfare and Screen. Later that year, Padukone played the part of a businessperson who helps Ranbir Kapoor's character overcome his conflicts in Imtiaz Ali's romantic drama Tamasha. Despite poor financial returns, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com named Padukone's performance as the best by an actress that year, writing that she \"is so potent in Tamasha, it\u2019s almost as if you can hear her heartbeat across the screen\". In her final release of 2015, Padukone reunited with Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Ranveer Singh in Bajirao Mastani, a historical drama about a tragic extramarital affair. Singh was cast as the maratha general Bajirao I, while Priyanka Chopra and Padukone featured as his first and second wife, respectively. In preparation for the role of the warrior-princess Mastani, Padukone learnt sword-fighting, horse-riding and kalaripayattu. With a revenue of over \u20b93.3 billion (US$51\u00a0million), Bajirao Mastani proved to be the fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. Anupama Chopra found Padukone \"riveting\" in the film, but Subhash K. Jha while praising her \"grace and dignity\" thought that she was \"way too subtle and silken, and not steely enough as [a] firebrand warrior-princess\". At the 61st Filmfare Awards, Bajirao Mastani was named Best Film and Padukone received her second Best Actress nomination in that year. The action film xXx: Return of Xander Cage (2017), in which Padukone played the lead female role opposite Vin Diesel, marked her first project in Hollywood. Critical reception of the film was mixed. Tirdad Derakhshani of The Philadelphia Inquirer termed the film a \"repetitious heap of remarkably tedious CGI-enhanced action scenes\" and thought that Padukone's talent was wasted in it. Conversely, Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter believed that she had successfully \"outclassed\" Diesel to \"practically [steal] the film\". The film earned over US$345 million worldwide, a majority of which came from the Chinese box office. As of April 2017, Padukone has filmed an item number in Dinesh Vijan's romance film Raabta. She is filming the part of Rani Padmini in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's historical drama Padmavati, opposite Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor, which marks her third collaboration with Bhansali and Singh. In addition, she has committed to star as Rahima Khan, a Mumbai-based gangster from the 1980s who plots to assassinate Dawood Ibrahim, in Vishal Bhardwaj's as-yet untitled crime drama biographical film, co-starring Irrfan Khan. In addition to acting, Padukone has written opinion columns and has been involved with women's health and fitness magazines. She has also supported charitable organisations, and has performed for stage shows. In 2009, she was hired by Hindustan Times to write weekly columns for their lifestyle section; through these columns she interacted with her fans and passed details of her personal and professional life. That year, she participated in the World 10K Bangalore marathon, which raised \u20b913.1 million (US$200,000) in support of 81\u00a0NGOs. In 2010, Padukone adopted the Maharashtrian village of Ambegaon as part of NDTV's Greenathon Campaign, to provide the village with a regular supply of electricity. She visited Indian jawans (troops) in Jammu, for an Independence Day special episode of NDTV's reality show Jai Jawaan. Padukone took part in the opening ceremony of the third season of the Indian Premier League at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai. Three years later, she performed alongside Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif, and Pitbull for the sixth edition of the Indian Premier League. In 2014, she participated in a concert tour across North America, entitled \"SLAM! The Tour\", in which she performed alongside her co-stars from Happy New Year. Padukone has also been involved with the Olympic Gold Quest team, established by her father and Geet Sethi to support Indian athletes at the Olympic Games, along with sports personalities such as Leander Paes and Viswanathan Anand and several other actors. In 2013, she launched her own line of clothing for women, in association with the retail chain Van Heusen. Two years later, Padukone collaborated with the fashion portal Myntra to launch another line under her brand \"All About You\". Padukone has also been outspoken on issues such as feminism and has said, \"New feminism isn't about being aggressive; it's about reaching the top yet being soft. It's about being you \u2014 feminine, strong and full of will power.\u201d In a 2015 interview, Padukone spoke about her personal experience of overcoming depression, and in October that year she formed a foundation to create awareness on mental health in India, named The Live Love Laugh Foundation. The following year, she launched a campaign named More Than Just Sad to assist general physicians in their treatment of patients suffering from depression or anxiety. Also in 2016, the foundation teamed with Facebook and the AASRA organisation to launch multilingual tools and educational resources in Facebook's networking site to support people with suicidal tendencies. Padukone became the brand ambassador for the NGO Indian Psychiatric Society and on her foundation's first anniversary, the two organisations collaborated to launch the video and poster campaign #DobaraPoocho dedicated to victims and survivors of depression. Padukone shares a close bond with her family, and visits them regularly in her hometown of Bangalore. She lives by herself in Prabhadevi, a neighbourhood in Mumbai, and admits to missing the presence of her family there. She says, \"I miss them, but luckily I have a life of my own, which keeps me from getting homesick. I wouldn\u2019t want them to uproot their lives from Bengaluru just to be with me.\" A practicing Hindu, Padukone considers religion to be an important aspect of her life and makes frequent visits to temples and other religious shrines. While filming Bachna Ae Haseeno in 2008, Padukone began a romantic relationship with co-star Ranbir Kapoor. She spoke openly about the relationship and sported a tattoo of his initials on the nape of her neck. She has said that the relationship had a profound effect on her, transforming her into a more confident and social person. The Indian media speculated on an engagement, and reported that this had occurred in November 2008, although Padukone had stated that she had no plans to marry within the next five years. The couple broke up a year later; she professed in an interview to feeling \"angry\" and \"betrayed\" for a long time, but insisted that they remained on good terms. In a 2010 interview, Padukone made a comment that the media speculated was a reference to her break-up with Kapoor: The first time he cheated on me, I thought there was something wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back. Kapoor initially denied the allegations, but according to The Times of India, he later admitted to the infidelity. In 2013, following the production of Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, Padukone told Filmfare that she now \"shares a great comfort level\" with him. In 2011, a set of pictures showing Padukone kissing the actor Siddharth Mallya at an Indian Premier League match were made available on the web. This led to wide speculation in the media about the nature of their relationship, which Padukone declined to talk about publicly. The following year there were reports about a break-up, to which she said: \"Just because we are not seen together, it doesn't mean that we are not friends anymore.\" She has since denied reports of her link-up to Ranveer Singh, stating that she is \"not in a frame of mind to be in a relationship.\" The journalist Vir Sanghvi, in 2013, described Padukone as \"strong, someone who makes up her own mind, [and] has motivation within herself.\" She is particularly known in the media as a professional, disciplined performer, whose \"work takes precedence over everything else.\" A reviewer for Rediff.com described her personality as \"simple,\" \"grounded,\" and \"accessible,\" and wrote, \"She takes criticism in her stride, acknowledges her limitations and strives to work hard at getting better. She handles praise with equal composure.\" Ayan Mukerji (the director of Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani) considers her to be \"a woman who will flirt with you but you will love to take her home to meet your mom as well.\" Padukone has maintained a Twitter account since 2010, and launched an official Facebook page in 2013. She is the most followed Asian woman on Twitter and most liked Indian actress on Facebook. One of the highest-paid actresses in the world, Padukone is considered among the most popular and high-profile celebrities in India. Analysing her career, Reuters published that after making a successful debut with Om Shanti Om, she featured in a series of films for which critics labelled her as \"wooden\" and \"mocked her accent.\" The Indian Express added, \"Not too long ago after a few unwise script calls and the public blow up of her high profile relationship with Ranbir Kapoor, Deepika was written off. Credit to her much touted professionalism, dedication, discipline and perseverance that she bounced back.\" Following the major success of Cocktail, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, and Chennai Express, several media publications began crediting her as the most successful contemporary actress in India. From 2014\u201316, she was the highest ranked woman on the Indian edition of Forbes' \"Celebrity 100\" (a list based on the income and popularity of India's celebrities), peaking at the sixth position in 2016 with an estimated annual earning of \u20b9698 million (US$11\u00a0million). Also that year, the global edition of Forbes ranked her as the tenth highest-paid actress in the world. In 2017, India Today featured her among the nation's 50 most powerful people. Padukone is considered a sex symbol and style icon in India \u2013 the media cites her figure, height 1.74\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft 8\u00a01\u20442\u00a0in), smile, and eyes as her distinctive physical features. The actress ranks high on various listings of the most attractive Indian celebrities. In 2008, she topped Indian Maxim's \"Hot 100\" list, and in 2012, she was named \"India's Most Beautiful Woman\" by the Indian edition of People magazine.

        "artist_name": "Dev_Anand", 
        "biography": " Dharam Dev Pishorimal Anand (Hindi: \u0927\u0930\u092e \u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092a\u093f\u0936\u094b\u0930\u0940\u092e\u0932 \u0906\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0926, 26 September 1923\u00a0\u2013 3 December 2011), better known as Dev Anand, was an Indian film actor, writer, director, producer, and comedian known for his notable works in the history of Indian cinema. Part of the Anand family, he co-founded Navketan Films in 1949 with his elder brother Chetan Anand. Anand is regarded as one of the most influential actors in the history of Indian cinema. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 2001 and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2002 for his contribution to Indian cinema. His career spanned more than 65 years (8 Decades) with acting in 114 Hindi films, of which 92 have him play the main solo lead hero, and he did two English films.   Dev was born Dharamdev Anand on 26 September 1923 in the Shakargarh tehsil of the Gurdaspur district in Punjab (British India) (present-day Narowal district of Pakistan). His father Pishori Lal Anand was a well-to-do advocate. Dev was the third of four sons born to Pishori Lal Anand. One of Dev's younger sisters is Sheel Kanta Kapur, who is the mother of film director Shekhar Kapur. His older brothers were Manmohan Anand (Advocate, Gurdaspur Dist. Court) and Chetan Anand and younger one was Vijay Anand. Dev Anand spent his early years in Gharota village . He did his schooling till matriculation from Sacred Heart School, Dalhousie, (then in Punjab) and went to college Dharamsala before going to Lahore to study. Later Dev completed BA degree in English Literature from the Government College, Lahore in British India. Dev Anand had an intense emotional love affair with actress Suraiya during 1948-1951, but it could not come to the marriage altar, because of great opposition by Suraiya's maternal grandmother. Suraiya remained unmarried throughout her life, till she died on 31 January 2004.  Later, in 1954, Dev Anand married Kalpana Kartik (actual name Mona Singha), a Christian Bollywood actress, originally from Shimla, in a very private marriage during the shooting of the film 'Taxi Driver'. They have two children, Suneil Anand, who is unmarried and Devina Anand (Narang). Devina married in 1985, but was divorced a few years later. Devina has a daughter, Gina (Narang) (born 1986), who is married to a fashion stylist, Prayag Menon. Gina is a professional photographer. After completing his BA degree in English Literature from the Government College, Lahore (then in British India, now in Pakistan), Dev Anand left his home-town for Bombay in the early 1940s. He began his career in the military censor's office at Churchgate, for a monthly salary of Rs. 165. Later he joined as a clerk in an accountancy firm for a salary of Rs. 85. He joined his older brother, Chetan, as a member of the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA). Dev Anand aspired to become a performer after seeing Ashok Kumar's performance in films like Achhut Kanya and Kismet. Dev Anand quoted in an interview that \"I remember when I gatecrashed into the office of the man who gave me the first break, he kept looking at me\u00a0\u2013 Babu Rao Pai of Prabhat Film Studios. At that time he made up his mind that this boy deserves a break and later mentioned to his people that \u2018this boy struck me because of his smile and beautiful eyes and his tremendous confidence.\" Then he was soon offered the lead role in Prabhat Films' Hum Ek Hain (1946), a film about Hindu-Muslim unity, where Dev Anand played a Hindu boy and was paired opposite Kamala Kotnis. While shooting the film in Pune, Anand befriended the actor Guru Dutt. Between them, they agreed that if one of them was to become successful in the film industry, they would help the other to be successful. They formed a mutual understanding that when Anand produced a film, Dutt would direct it and when Dutt directed a film, Anand would act in it. In the late 1940s, Anand was offered a few roles starring as the male lead opposite singer-actress Suraiya in woman-oriented films. He considered himself to be very lucky to get a chance to star opposite such an established actress and accepted the offers. While shooting these films, they became romantically involved. The two of them were paired in seven films together: Vidya (1948), Jeet (1949), Shair (1949), Afsar (1950), Nili (1950), Do Sitare (1951) and Sanam (1951), all of which were successful at the box office. In these films, Suraiya was always first-biller in the credits, indicating that she was a bigger star than Anand. She fell in love with him during the shooting of the song Kinare kinare chale jayen ge from the film Vidya\u2014 while shooting the scene, the boat they were in capsized, and Anand saved Suraiya from drowning. Initially, Suraiya's family used to welcome Dev Anand at home, but when her maternal grandmother found out that the two were in love, and even planned an actual marriage on the sets of 'Jeet', she started monitoring them. The two shared love letters and messages through their co-actors, like Durga Khote and Kamini Kaushal, who went out of their way to engineer secret rendezvous. On the sets of the film Jeet, Anand finally proposed to Suraiya and gave her a diamond ring worth Rs 3,000. Her maternal grandmother opposed the relationship as they were Muslim and Anand was Hindu, and so, Suraiya remained unmarried. They stopped acting together after her grandmother opposed their partnership, and Do Sitare was the last film in which they appeared. Although the films he starred in with Suraiya had been successful, the producers and directors of those films attributed their success to the acting prowess and screen presence of Suraiya. Anand began looking for an opportunity to play the main male lead in a film where his acting skills could be demonstrated, so as to dispel scepticism about his acting abilities. Anand was offered his first big break by Ashok Kumar. He spotted Anand hanging around in the studios and picked him as the hero for the Bombay Talkies production, Ziddi (1948), co-starring Kamini Kaushal, which became an instant success. After Ziddi's success, Anand decided that he would start producing films. It was in the film Ziddi, where the first-ever Kishore-Lata duet, Yeh Kaun Aaya Karke Yeh Sola Singhar, was recorded. This duet was an instant hit, and from here, on both the playback singers' association with Dev Anand began. It continued for next four decades. His association with Kishore Kumar started when the former sang the first solo of his playback singing career\u00a0\u2013 Marne Ki Duayen\u00a0\u2013 picturised on Dev Anand in the movie Ziddi. Dev had forged a very strong bond of friendship with Kishore Kumar during the making of the film. In 1949, he launched his own company Navketan Films (which means \"newness\"), which, as of 2011, had produced 35 films. Dev chose Guru Dutt as director for the crime thriller, Baazi (1951). The film, starring Dev Anand, Geeta Bali and Kalpana Kartik was a trendsetter, regarded as the forerunner of the spate of urban crime films that followed in Bollywood in the 1950s. The film Baazi saw debut of Kalpana Kartik (aka Mona Singh) as the lead female actress and Guru Dutt as a director. The collaboration was a success at the box office and the duo of Dev Anand and Kalpana Kartik were offered many films to star in together. They signed all the film offers and subsequently the movies Aandhiyan (1952), Taxi Driver (1954), House No. 44 (1955) and Nau Do Gyarah (1957) went on to become big hits too. During the making of film Taxi Driver, the couple fell in love and Dev proposed marriage to his heroine Kalpana. In 1954, Taxi Driver was declared a hit and the two decided to marry in a quiet ceremony. The couple had a son, Suneil Anand in 1956 and later a daughter, Devina, was born. After her marriage, Kalpana decided not to pursue her acting career further. Nau Do Gyarah was the couple's last movie together. A rapid-fire style of dialogue delivery and a penchant for nodding while speaking became Dev's style in films like House No. 44 (1955), Pocket Maar (1956), Munimji (1955), Funtoosh (1956), C.I.D. (1956) and Paying Guest (1957). In the 1950s his films were of the mystery genre or light comedy love stories or were films with social relevance like Ek Ke Baad Ek (1959) and Funtoosh (1956). His style was lapped up by the audience and was widely imitated. He starred in a string of box office successes for the remainder of the 1950s opposite newcomer Waheeda Rehman in C.I.D. (1956), Solva Saal (1958), Kala Pani (1958), Kala Bazar (1960) and Baat Ek Raat Ki (1962). Waheeda first became a star with C.I.D becoming a hit. In 1955 he also co-starred with Dilip Kumar in Insaniyat. With his acting in Kala Pani (1958), as the son who is willing to go to any lengths to clear his framed father's name, he won his first Filmfare award for Best Actor for the film. He attempted films of tragic genre occasionally like Pocket Maar (1956), Kala Pani (1958), Bombai Ka Baboo (1960) and Sharabi (1964) and tasted success with them. Dev also played a few characters with a negative shade, like in Jaal (1952) where he played a smuggler, then as an absconding gang member in Dushman, as a black marketer in Kala Bazar. Apart from his pair with Suraiya and Kalpana Kartik, his pair with Nutan and Waheeda Rehman was popular among the audiences in late 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s. His films Rahi (1952) and Aandhiyan (1952), were screened along with Raj Kapoor's Awaara. From the early fifties till mid sixties, the trio of Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor and Dev Anand ruled the roost. In the sixties, Dev Anand acquired a romantic image with films like Manzil and Tere Ghar Ke Samne with Nutan, Kinaare Kinaare with Meena Kumari, Maya with Mala Sinha, Asli-Naqli with Sadhana Shivdasani, Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai and Mahal with Asha Parekh and Teen Deviyaan opposite three heroines Kalpana, Simi Garewal and Nanda. In the film Teen Deviyaan, Dev Anand played a playboy. His first colour film, Guide with Waheeda Rehman was based on the novel of the same name by R. K. Narayan. Dev Anand himself was the impetus for making the film version of the book. He met and persuaded Narayan to give his assent to the project. Dev Anand tapped his friends in Hollywood to launch an Indo-US co-production that was shot in Hindi and English simultaneously and was released in 1965. Guide, directed by younger brother Vijay Anand, was an acclaimed movie. Dev played Raju, a voluble guide, who supports Rosy (Waheeda) in her bid for freedom. He is not above thoughtlessly exploiting her for personal gains. Combining style with substance, he gave an affecting performance as a man grappling with his emotions in his passage through love, shame and salvation. He reunited with Vijay Anand for the movie Jewel Thief, based on thriller genre which featured Vyjayanthimala, Tanuja, Anju Mahendru, Faryal and Helen and was very successful. Their next collaboration, Johny Mera Naam (1970), again a thriller, where Dev was paired opposite Hema Malini was a big hit. It was Johnny Mera Naam which made Hema Malini a big star. In 1969 he was a member of the jury at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival. His directorial debut, the espionage drama Prem Pujari, was a flop but has developed a cult following over the years. The film introduced Zaheeda and had Waheeda Rahman as the lead female artiste. He tasted success with his 1971 directorial effort, Hare Rama Hare Krishna which talked about the prevalent hippie culture. His find Zeenat Aman, who played the mini-skirt sporting, pot-smoking Janice, became an overnight sensation. Dev also became known as a filmmaker of trenchantly topical themes. This same year, he starred with Mumtaz in Tere Mere Sapne, an adaptation of A. J. Cronin's novel, The Citadel. The film was directed by Dev's brother, Vijay and was also successful. In 1971 he paired again with Zaheeda in Gambler which went on to become a success. In the 1970s, Raj Kapoor started playing roles of father in films like Kal Aaj Aur Kal in 1971 and Dharam Karam in 1974 and had put lot of weight and films with Dilip Kumar as lead hero were failures at the box office . Some of the hurriedly made films with Dev Anand as the leading man\u2014three each opposite Hema Malini and Zeenat Aman and Yeh Gulistaan Hamara with Sharmila Tagore\u2014became flops and posed a threat to his career as leading man. But he delivered commercial hits again with young heroines Yogeeta Bali and Raakhee in Banarasi Babu (1973), Hema Malini in Chhupa Rustam (1973) and Amir Garib (1974), Zeenat Aman in Heera Panna(1973), Warrant(1975) and Darling Darling (1977) and Parveen Babi in Bullet(1976). The presence of his discoveries in the 1970s\u2014Zeenat, and later Tina Munim, in films and his good onscreen chemistry with beautiful young stars like Raakhee, Parveen Babi, Hema Malini, Zeenat Aman in various films boosted Dev's image as the evergreen star even though he was well into his fifties. Dev Anand has also been politically active. He led a group of film personalities who stood up against the Internal Emergency imposed by the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi. He actively campaigned against her with his supporters in Indian parliamentary elections in 1977. He also formed a party called the \"National Party of India\", which he later disbanded. The 1978 hit Des Pardes, directed by Dev Anand was the debut movie of actress Tina Munim and this film\u2019s success gave him the tag of evergreen hero. He was 55 but he shared very good chemistry with the 20-year-old Tina Munim. Dev Anand was offered lead role in Man Pasand by director Basu Chatterjee. Dev Anand\u2019s successful run at the box office continued in the 1980s with Man Pasand, Lootmaar (both opposite Tina Munim), Swami Dada (1982) being both critically acclaimed and box office hits. Though Dev Anand\u2019s demand as the lead hero had not decreased even in the 1980s, he decided that it was the right time to introduce his son Suneil Anand in films as the hero. He launched his son in the Kramer vs. Kramer inspired Anand Aur Anand (1984), which was produced and directed by Dev Anand himself and had music by R.D. Burman. He expected the film to do well but the film was a box office disaster and Suneil Anand decided not to act in films any more. But films with Dev Anand as the lead hero Hum Naujawan (1985), Lashkar (1989) continued to be box office success and was appreciated by critics. Awwal Number (1990), where Dev Anand co-starred with Aditya Pancholi and Aamir Khan became an average grosser. Aamir said in an interview that Awwal Number is the only film he signed without reading the script because it was being directed by his senior Dev Anand. Aamir quoted \u201cDev saab was an icon for many generations and entertained us throughout his life. He was already 60 years old in 1983 when he acted with Padmini Kolhapure in Swami Dada but looked half his age and shared a good on screen chemistry. In 1989, his directorial venture Sachche ka Bolbala was released. Though critically acclaimed, it was a commercial failure. His directorial movie \"Gangster\" (1995) had a controversial nude rape scene of an unknown actress, even then the movie was released uncut. Since the 1990s except for Awwal Number, rest of the eight films directed by him were box office failures. But Sau Crore (1991) and Censor (2000) were critically acclaimed. His last film Chargesheet (2011) was panned by critics across the board. The only two hero film he acted in were Insaniyat in 1955 with Dilip Kumar and Return of Jewel Thief with Dharmendra in 1996. He also starred in English films like The Evil Within(1970) where he was paired opposite Vietnamese actress Kieu Chinh and Zeenat Aman and Guide (English Version). The Enlglish film 'The Evil Within' was 20th Century Fox production which couldn't get the nod from the concerned authorities due to its parallel track dealing with opium selling and thus the Indian viewers were deprived of this English venture. Of the 114 Hindi films he appeared in 6 decades, Kahin Aur Chal (1968) had a delayed release in early 1970s and multistarrer film Ek Do Teen Chaar (1980) remained unreleased and Shrimanji (1968) had him in guest appearance and 82 were box office hits and 29 were commercial failures. By 2011, he held the record for being the second actor from Hindi films who has played the central solo lead character in maximum films\u2014 92 , with first being Rajesh Khanna who played author backed solo lead hero in maximum films 106. Often compared to the famous actor Gregory Peck the world over, Dev Anand said that he didn't feel ecstatic bearing the tag line bestowed on him in his hey days. \"When you are at an impressionable age you make idols. But when you grow out of the phase, you develop your own persona. I don't want to be known as India's Gregory Peck, I am Dev Anand\". Acquainted to the Bollywood actor, Peck's personal interactions with him spanned four to five long meetings in Europe and Mumbai. Dev Anand and Suraiya met Peck for the first time at Mumbai's Willingdon Club, after the Filmfare Awards in 1954, on Peck's stopover in the city from a schedule at Sri Lanka after shooting for Purple Plane. He knew of the 'Indian Star' as an actor, more so probably because of his romance with Suraiya was grabbing the headlines, and they had a chat. The second time they met in Rome when Dev Anand was on his way back from the Venice Film Festival, he visited him on the sets of Roman Holiday. \"I was returning from the Venice film fest. I stopped my car and joined the crowd watching the shoot, hoping that his eyes would fall on me. As expected, he nodded and I walked up to him. He remembered me and we exchanged pleasantries.\" The third meeting was at London on the sets of Moby Dick. However, Suraiya asked for an exclusive meeting with her idol at her house. Though Anand says jealousy was natural for anyone in love, he didn't mind that he was not invited. \"I didn't quite feel anything. It wasn't as if they were going to fall in love or make love. Even if they would have, it wouldn't have mattered. I was mature enough. Moreover, he wasn't my rival. I too was a big star by then,\" says Anand. Dev Anand has directed 19 films and produced 35 films of which 7 directorial ventures and 18 films respectively were commercially successful at the box office. He wrote the story for 13 of his films. Critics say his directorial ventures have always been ahead of its time. Dev Anand's films are well known for their hit songs. He is known to have been an active participant in the music sessions of a number of his films. His association with music composers Shankar-Jaikishen, O. P. Nayyar, Kalyanji-Anandji, Sachin Dev Burman and his son Rahul Dev Burman, lyricists Hasrat Jaipuri, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Gopaldas Neeraj, Shailendra, Anand Bakshi, and playback singers Mohammed Rafi, Hemant Kumar and Kishore Kumar produced some very popular songs. Mohammed Rafi, Pran, Kishore Kumar, S.D Burman and R.D Burman were his closest friends from film industry. In September 2007, Dev's own autobiography Romancing with Life was released at a birthday party with the Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh. In February 2011, his 1961 black and white film Hum Dono was digitised and colourised and released. Dev Anand is credited with giving actors like Zarina Wahab in Ishq Ishq Ishq, Jackie Shroff in Swami Dada, Tabu in Hum Naujawan and Richa Sharma(Sanjay Dutt\u2019s first wife) a break into the film industry, discovered Zeenat Amaan, Tina Munim and encouraging music composer Rajesh Roshan. Amit Khanna started his career with Navketan as executive producer in 1971 and had been secretary to Dev Anand in 1970s. He adds, \"The uniqueness of Navketan today is that it's the only film company in the world still run by the one who started it.\" Shatrughan Sinha disclosed in an interview that it was Dev Anand who gave him a break in films by giving a role in 'Prem Pujari' and since Dev had given Sinha a very small role in that film, he compensated for it by giving Sinha another role in his next film 'Gambler'. Sinha quoted \"Later on we worked together in 'Sharif Badmash' and it was really a privilege to work with him\". It was under Dev Anand's Navketan Banner where Guru Dutt, Raj Khosla, Waheeda Rahman, S.D. Burman, Jaidev, Sahir Ludhianvi, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Yash Johar, Shekhar Kapur, Kabir Bedi were given breaks into Hindi films and Dev launched actors Zaheera, Zaheeda Hussain, Zarina Wahab, Natasha Sinha, Ekta Sohini, Sabrina. Dev Anand died in his room at The Washington Mayfair Hotel in London at the age of 88 on 3 December 2011 (4 December 2011 by Indian Standard Time) of a cardiac arrest. His death came just months after the release of his last film, Chargesheet. Anand was reportedly in London for a medical check up at the time of his death. Condolences poured in from all corners of the Indian film industry, with most of them remembering his positive attitude towards life. On 10 December, his funeral service was held at a small chapel in London after which his casket was taken to the Putney Vale Crematorium in South West London for cremation. His ashes were returned to India for immersion burial in the Godavari River. Winner Winner "

He was elected as a Member of the Parliament in the 2004 general elections, from Bikaner in Rajasthan, on a Bharatiya Janata Party ticket. During his election campaign, he made an ironic remark that he should be elected Dictator perpetuo to teach \"basic etiquette that democracy requires\" for which he was severely criticized. He rarely attended Parliament when the house was in session, preferring to spend the time shooting for movies or doing farm-work at his farm house. In 1983 Deol set up a production company known as Vijayta Films. Its first film was Betaab, released in 1983, starring his son Sunny Deol as the lead actor in his debut movie. The film was a blockbuster. In 1990 he produced the action flick Ghayal, also starring Sunny. The film won seven Filmfare Awards, including the Best Movie Award. It won National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. Dharmendra launched the career of his younger son, Bobby, in 1995 in Barsaat. Dharmendra's first marriage was to Parkash Kaur at the age of 19 in 1954. From his first marriage, he has two sons, Sunny and Bobby, both successful actors, and two daughters, Vijeeta and Ajeeta. He has four grandsons.[citation needed] After moving to Mumbai and getting into the film business, Dharmendra wed Hema Malini after converting to Islam to stay married to his previous wife without having to get a divorce, although he later denied any conversion to Islam. He and Malini starred together in a number of movies in the early 1970s including the superhit film, Sholay. The couple has two daughters, Esha and Ahana Deol. Dharmendra was a great fan of the famous singer actress Suraiya. He is said to have watched her film 'Dillagi' (1949) 40 times, after having to walk several miles on foot in his hometown Sahnewal to go to the nearest cinema hall. He also attended her funeral, when she died in 2004, when most actors gave the occasion a miss. Filmfare Award for Best Movie"

        "artist_name": "Dilip_Kumar", 
        "biography": " Dilip Kumar (born Muhammad Yusuf Khan on 11 December 1922) is an Indian film actor, producer and activist known as Tragedy King, He has been described as \"the ultimate method actor\"(natural actor) by Satyajit Ray. He debuted as an actor in the film Jwar Bhata in 1944 produced by Bombay Talkies. His career has spanned over six decades and with over 60 films. Kumar is known for his roles in films such as the romantic Andaz (1949), the swashbuckling Aan (1952), the dramatic Devdas (1955), the comical Azaad (1955), the historical Mughal-e-Azam (1960) and the social Ganga Jamuna (1961). In 1976, Dilip Kumar took a five-year break from film performances and returned with a character role in the film Kranti (1981) and continued his career playing leading roles in films such as Shakti (1982), Karma (1986) and Saudagar (1991). His last film was Qila (1998). He is the winner of nine Filmfare Awards and is the first recipient of Filmfare Best Actor Award (1954). He still holds the record for the most number of Filmfare awards won for that category with eight wins (Shah Rukh Khan tied with him in 2011). Critics acclaimed him among one of the greatest actors in the history of Hindi cinema. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1991, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1994 and India's second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan in 2015 for his contributions towards Indian cinema and nominated him to Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian Parliament for a term. The Government of Pakistan honoured him with its highest civilian honour, the Nishan-e-Imtiaz, in 1997.   Kumar was born Mohammad Yusuf Khan in a Hindko Pashto-speaking  family of 12 children on 11 December 1922 at his house in the Qissa Khawani Bazaar area of Peshawar, in what is now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. His father, Lala Ghulam Sarwar, was a landlord and fruit merchant who owned orchards in Peshawar and Deolali (in Maharashtra, India). Dilip Kumar was schooled at Barnes School, Deolali. In the late 1930s, his family relocated to Bombay.[citation needed] In 1940, while still in his teens and after an altercation with his father, Dilip Kumar left home for Poona. With the help of an Iranian cafe owner, and an elderly Anglo-Indian couple, Kumar met a canteen contractor. Without letting on his family antecedents, he got the job on the merit of his knowledge of good written and spoken English. He managed to set up a sandwich stall at the army club and when the contract ended he headed home to Bombay having saved Rs. 5000. In 1942, anxious to start some venture to help out his father with household finances, he met Dr. Masani at Churchgate Station, who asked him to accompany him to Bombay Talkies, in Malad. Here he met actress Devika Rani, owner of Bombay Talkies, who asked him to sign up with the company on a pay of Rs. 1250 per month. Here he met actor Ashok Kumar who was to influence his acting style telling him to act \"natural\". He also met Sashadhar Mukherjee, and both these people became very close to Kumar over the years. Initially, Kumar helped out in the story-writing and scripting department because of his proficiency in Urdu language. Devika Rani requested to change his name from Yousuf to Dilip Kumar, and later cast him in a lead role for the film Jwar Bhata (1944), which marked Dilip Kumar's entry into the Hindi film industry. Dilip Kumar's first film was Jwar Bhata in 1944, which went unnoticed. After a few more unsuccessful films, it was Jugnu (1947), in which he starred alongside Noor Jehan, that became his first major hit at the box office. His next major hits were the 1948 films Shaheed and Mela. He got his breakthrough role in 1949 with Mehboob Khan's Andaz in which he starred alongside Raj Kapoor and Nargis. Shabnam also released that year was another box office hit. Kumar went on to have success in the 1950s with playing leading roles in romantic films like Jogan (1950), Babul (1950), Tarana (1951) Hulchul (1951) Deedar (1951), Daag (1952), Uran Khatola (1955), Devdas (1955), Yahudi (1958) and Madhumati (1958). These films established his screen image as the \"Tragedy King\". He also starred in many social drama films like Footpath (1953), Naya Daur (1957), Musafir (1957) and Paigham (1959). He was the first actor to win the Filmfare Best Actor Award for Daag and went on to win it a further seven times in his career. He formed popular on-screen pairings with many of the top actresses at the time including Madhubala, Vyjayanthimala, Nargis, Nimmi, Meena Kumari and Kamini Kaushal. He also played lighthearted roles in an attempt to shed his \"tragedy king\" image upon his psychiatrist's suggestion. In Mehboob Khan's musical Aan (1952), he played a swashbuckling peasant in what marked his first film in technicolor. He had further success with lighter roles as a thief in the comedy Azaad (1955) and as a royal prince in the romantic musical Kohinoor (1960) In 1960, he portrayed Prince Salim in K. Asif's big-budget epic historical film Mughal-e-Azam which was the highest-grossing film in Hindi film history if adjusted for inflation for 15 years until it was surpassed by 1975's Sholay. The film told the story of Prince Salim who revolts against his father Akbar (played by Prithviraj Kapoor) and falls in love with a courtesan (played by Madhubala). The film was mostly shot in black and white, with only some scenes in the latter half of the film shot in colour. 44 years after its original release, it was fully colourised and re-released in 2004. In 1961, Kumar produced and starred in Ganga Jamuna opposite his frequent leading lady Vyjayanthimala and his brother Nasir Khan, this was the only film he produced. In 1962 British director David Lean offered him the role of \"Sherif Ali\" in his film Lawrence of Arabia (1962), but Dilip Kumar declined to perform in the movie. The role eventually went to Omar Sharif, the Egyptian actor. Dilip Kumar comments in his much later released autobiography, \"he thought Omar Sharif had played the role far better than he himself could have\". His next film Leader (1964) was a below average grosser at the box office. He was the co-director alongside Abdul Rashid Kardar of his next release Dil Diya Dard Liya in 1966 but was uncredited as director. The critics were of opinion that the film was slow paced and whole film was a let down. In 1967, Kumar played a dual role of twins separated at birth in the hit film Ram Aur Shyam. In 1968, he starred alongside Manoj Kumar and Waheeda Rehman in Aadmi. That same year he starred in Sangharsh with Sanjeev Kumar. In the period, 1969 to 1976, Dilip and Raj Kapoor did not enjoy as much success in films and their popularity reduced. Actors like Ashok Kumar, Dev Anand, Pran and Rajendra Kumar continued to enjoy more success even in 1960's to 1980s in comparison to Dilip and Raj Kapoor. Kumar's career slumped in the 1970s with films like Dastaan (1972) and Bairaag (1976), the latter in which he played triple roles failing at the box office. He starred alongside his real-life wife Saira Banu in Gopi (1970) which was success. They were paired again in his first and only Bengali film Sagina Mahato (1970). A Hindi remake Sagina was made in 1974 with the same cast. He played triple roles as a father and twin sons in Bairaag (1976) whch failed to do well at the box office. Though his performance in Bairaag and Gopi were critically acclaimed, he lost many film offers to act in lead roles to actors Rajesh Khanna and Sanjeev Kumar from 1968 to 1987. He took a five-year hiatus from films from 1976 to 1981. In 1981, he returned to films as a character actor playing central roles in ensemble films. His comeback film was the multi-starrer Kranti which was the biggest hit of the year. Appearing alongside an ensemble cast including Manoj Kumar, Shashi Kapoor, Hema Malini and Shatrughan Sinha, he played the title role as a revolutionary fighting for India's independence from British rule. He then formed a successful collaboration with Subhash Ghai starting with Vidhaata (1982) in which he starred alongside Sanjay Dutt, Sanjeev Kumar and Shammi Kapoor. Later that year he starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan in Ramesh Sippy's Shakti. In 1984 he starred in Yash Chopra's Mashaal opposite Anil Kapoor and Ramesh Talwar's Duniya opposite Rishi Kapoor. His second collaboration with Subhash Ghai came with the 1986 action film Karma. In this film, Kumar played a jailor who hires three men (played by Naseeruddin Shah, Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor) to help him avenge his family's death by escaped terrorist Doctor Dang (played by Anupam Kher). Karma was one of the highest grossers of the 1980s and was also the first film which paired him opposite veteran actress Nutan. In 1991, Kumar starred alongside fellow veteran actor Raaj Kumar in Saudagar, his third and last film with director Subhash Ghai. This was his second film with Raaj Kumar after 1959's Paigham. Saudagar was Kumar's last box office success and would be his penultimate film. In 1993, he won the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1992, producer Sudhakar Bokade announced a film titled Kalinga which would be directed by and star Kumar in the leading role. After being delayed for several years, Kalinga was eventually left incomplete and shelved. In 1998, he made his last film appearance in Qila, where he played dual roles as an evil landowner who is murdered and as his twin brother who tries to solve the mystery of his death. India Today in their review dismissed Kumar's dialogue delivery out of sync. In 2001 he was set to appear in a film titled Asar\u00a0\u2014 The Impact alongside Ajay Devgan which was shelved. His classic films Mughal-e-Azam and Naya Daur were fully colorised and re-released in cinemas in 2004 and 2008 respectively. Kumar was nominated as a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India, by the Indian National Congress for the period 2000\u20132006. Kumar launched his Twitter account and his first tweet was on his 89th birthday in 2011. Dilip Kumar first fell in love with married actress Kamini Kaushal. He then was in love with the actress Madhubala but they parted ways as her family was opposed to their union. Vyjayanthimala was considered by film fans as Kumar's third love; they have denied rumours of an affair. Both of them have had many successful films as a pair in the period 1955 to 1968. He married actress Saira Banu, who was 22 years younger than him, in 1966. He married a second time in 1980 to Asma but the marriage ended soon after. Dilip Kumar undertook a pilgrimage to Mecca in 2013 along with his wife Saira. Dilip Kumar is widely considered as one of the greatest actors in the history of Hindi cinema. He holds the Guinness World Record for winning the maximum number of awards by an Indian actor. He has received many awards throughout his career, including 8 Filmfare Best Actor awards and 19 Filmfare nominations. He was honoured with the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993. Kumar was appointed Sheriff of Mumbai (an honorary position) in 1980, the Government of India honoured Kumar with the Padma Bhushan in 1991, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1994 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2015. The Government of Andhra Pradesh honoured Kumar with NTR National Award in 1997. The Government of Pakistan conferred Kumar with Nishan-e-Imtiaz, the highest civilian award in Pakistan, in 1998. The ruling political party of Shiv Sena in Maharashtra had objected to this award and questioned Kumar's patriotism. However, in 1999 in consultation with the then Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Kumar retained the award. He was honoured with CNN-IBN Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009.

        "artist_name": "Dimple_Kapadia", 
        "biography": " Dimple Kapadia (born 8 June 1957) is an Indian film actress. She was launched by Raj Kapoor at age 16, playing the title role in his teen romance Bobby (1973). In that same year she married Indian actor Rajesh Khanna and retired from acting. Kapadia returned to the film industry in 1984, following her separation from Khanna. One of her films of that period was the drama Saagar (1985). Both Bobby and Saagar won her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. She went on to establish herself as one of the leading actresses of Hindi cinema in the 1980s. Initially recognized as a national sex symbol, Kapadia was keen to avoid being stereotyped and expand her range of acting roles. She subsequently took on more serious parts in a range of film genres, from mainstream to parallel cinema, and received acclaim for her performances in such films as Kaash (1987), Drishti (1990), Lekin... (1990), and Rudaali (1993), which earned her a National Film Award for Best Actress and a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress. She followed with supporting roles in Gardish (1993) and Krantiveer (1994), the latter of which garnered her a fourth Filmfare Award. Kapadia continued working infrequently through the 1990s and the 2000s. She played a minor part in Dil Chahta Hai (2001) and was noted for her portrayal of the title role in the American production Leela (2002). Some of her later film credits include leading roles in Hum Kaun Hai? (2004), Pyaar Mein Twist (2005), Phir Kabhi (2008) and Tum Milo Toh Sahi (2010), and supporting roles in Being Cyrus (2005), Luck by Chance (2009), Dabangg (2010), Cocktail (2012) and Finding Fanny (2014). Kapadia is the mother of Twinkle Khanna and Rinke Khanna, both former actresses.   Kapadia is the eldest of the four children of Gujarati entrepreneur Chunnibhai Kapadia and Betty, her younger siblings being late actress Simple Kapadia, a sister named Reem and a brother, Munna. The family resided in Santa Cruz, Mumbai, and she studied at St. Joseph's Convent High School. Due to her father's wealth and business, she has described her upbringing as \"different\". She married actor Rajesh Khanna six months before the release of her first film, Bobby, in 1973. She then retired from acting for twelve years to raise her two daughters, Twinkle (b. 1973) and Rinke (b. 1977). Reportedly, it was Khanna who \"put a ban on her acting career promptly after the marriage,\" though Kapadia has once noted that \"career has always been secondary\" to her. Kapadia separated from Khanna in April 1982, leaving the house with her two daughters back to her parents. She returned to acting two years later. In a 1985 interview with India Today, she remarked, \"The life and happiness in our house came to an end the day I and Rajesh got married,\" sharing her unhappy marital experience and calling their marriage \"a farce\". Asked in Filmfare whether she would want to marry again, Kapadia replied, \"I'm very happy and content. Why do I need to get married again? Once was more than enough.\" In 2010, reporter Dinesh Raheja stated that \"the bitterness between Rajesh and Dimple washed away\", noting that they are seen together at parties and that Dimple campaigned for Khanna's election and also worked in his film Jai Shiv Shankar. In a later interview she reflected back positively on her marriage, referring to it as her \"biggest high\". Her daughters also became actresses and retired after settling down. Her elder daughter, Twinkle Khanna, is married to actor Akshay Kumar. Kapadia once said she had always had aspirations to become an actress when she was a child, calling herself \"film-crazy\". She was introduced by Raj Kapoor in his 1973 teen romance Bobby. While the film was to be Kapoor's son Rishi Kapoor's first leading role, Kapadia was given the title role of Bobby Braganza, a middle-class Goan Christian girl. The story follows how Bobby falls in love with Raj (Rishi), the son of a wealthy businessman, and how the two face the disapproval of their parents. Bobby was a major mainstream and critical success, and Kapadia was lauded for her performance, which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress (tied with Jaya Bhaduri for Abhimaan). In later years Kapadia would credit Raj Kapoor for her development as an actress: \"the sum total of me today as an actress, whatever I am, is Raj Kapoor.\" Several of her lines in the film became popular, particularly, \"Mujhse dosti karoge?\" (\"Will you be my friend?\"). In 2008, Rediff.com ranked her performance in the film as the fourth-best female debut of all-time in Hindi cinema: \"An elfin little girl with big, lovely eyes, nobody quite portrayed innocence as memorably as Dimple in her first outing. She was candid, striking, and a true natural\u00a0... here was a girl who would redefine glamour and grace, and make it look very, very easy indeed.\" Following the success of the film, Kapadia's modern wardrobe and hairstyle in Bobby, consisting of \"knotted polka-dotted blouse and earphone hairstyle\", made her a youth fashion icon of the times in India. Consequently polka-dotted dresses were often referred to as 'Bobby Print'. Bhawana Somaaya of The Hindu credits Kapadia as starting film memorabilia merchandising in India. Mukesh Khosla of The Tribune reported that Bobby established her as a \"cult figure\" as she led the fashion trends. Kapadia had married actor Rajesh Khanna in March 1973 at the age of 16 and eight months later her debut film released. She left the film industry to raise her children. After Kapadia's separation from Khanna in 1982, she was keen on returning to acting, which she ultimately did in 1984. For the next decade, she would go on to become one of top five commercial actresses in Bollywood along with Sridevi, Madhuri Dixit, Meenakshi Sheshadri and Jaya Prada. Kapadia accredited the reason for her return was because of a personal need to prove to herself her own capabilities. The first film she worked on was Saagar, directed by Ramesh Sippy, after a mutual friend had notified Sippy about her willingness to return to acting. She first performed a screen test, which according to her was very unsuccessful as she was extremely nervous and \"literally shivering\" while making it. To her surprise, Sippy ultimately signed her on to play the lead part opposite her Bobby co-star Rishi Kapoor. Scripted with her in mind, the film was intended to be her comeback vehicle, but its one-year delay meant that several of her proceeding projects would be released before, the first of which was Zakhmi Sher (1984). Saagar eventually premiered in August 1985 and was controversial for several scenes featuring Kapadia, including one scene in which she was seen topless for a split second. The film was a critical success and was eventually chosen as India's official entry to the Oscars that year. Kapadia's performance as Mona D'Silva, a young woman from Goa who is torn between her friend (Kamal Haasan) and the man she loves (Kapoor), won her a second Best Actress award at the Filmfare Awards. A review by Asiaweek labelled her \"a delight\". Rediff.com noted, \"Dimple, caught between a friend and lover, performed solidly and memorably, grounding the two male leads and making the film work.\" A 1993 issue of India Today wrote, \"Saagar was in many ways a paean to her incredible beauty. She looked ravishing: auburn hair, classical face, deep eyes, an aura of sensuality. It was clear she was back.\" In 1984 she had a role opposite Sunny Deol in Manzil Manzil, a drama directed by Nasir Hussain. She later said making the film was \"one big picnic\", though she expressed her lack of comfort performing the \"routine song-and-dance\" nature of the part. Kapadia's first film of 1985 was Mukul Anand's Aitbaar, a Hitchcockian thriller for which she received positive reviews. Speaking of her performance, she said that during shooting she was \"a bag of nerves\", which eventually ended up working \"to my advantage as it lent my performance the right shade of tautness, without my realising it.\" Among other films released that year, Kapadia was paired up with Sunny Deol in Arjun, an action film directed by Rahul Rawail and scripted by Javed Akhtar. Feroz Khan's Janbaaz (1986) told the story of a man fighting the drug menace. The film became known for its steamy love scene involving Kapadia and male lead Anil Kapoor, in which the two also shared a full on kiss, something Hindi movie-goers were not accustomed to in those days. In that same year she acted opposite Saagar co-star Kamal Haasan in her first regional film, Vikram, a Tamil-language sci-fi feature. She played the minor part of Inimaasi, a young princess who falls for the title character, played by Haasan. At that time, she also worked in numerous Hindi films made by producers from the South, including Pataal Bhairavi, which she detested. She has confessed to accepting these roles for financial gain rather than artistic merit during this period, noting, \"I shudder even now when I think of those films. As an artiste I got totally corrupted.\" \"After three years of near-frustration in my career, I bagged Mahesh Bhatt's film Kaash. This film changed my whole outlook. After all those professional brickbats, when Mahesh asked me to do his film I think I got one of the biggest highs of my career. Working for Mahesh has been the most satisfying phase in my entire career as an actress. If I can imbibe even 25% of what he has taught me, I feel I will be made as an artiste.\" In 1987, Kapadia starred in Mahesh Bhatt's drama Kaash. Kapadia and Jackie Shroff starred as an estranged couple who, during a relentless legal battle over the custody of their only son, learn that the boy is suffering from leukaemia, which makes them reunite to spend together the last months of his life. Before shooting began, she called it \"the most serious artistic challenge I have ever faced in my career.\" Bhatt said he decided to cast her in the role because he was aware of her own marital experience, and he noted that during the making of the film she \"came closer and closer to the naked truth,\" so much that \"after a certain point, mentally I couldn't differentiate between Dimple and Pooja. She became the character.\" Kapadia's performance as Pooja was highly praised by critics. In an article discussing her career's best roles, The Times of India wrote, \"As\u00a0... [a] long-suffering wife who tries making a living for herself and her young son by working odd jobs, Dimple showed immense strength as a performer. This has to be one of her best and most unrecognised performances.\" Sukanya Verma from Rediff.com noted, \"She rendered her Pooja with stoic determination and touching vulnerability making her character extremely believable and sympathetic at once.\" In 1988, she played the main protagonist in Zakhmi Aurat, that of a female police officer who gets gang-raped and, after the judicial system fails to convict the criminals, abandons the legal course and joins forces with other rape victims to get revenge by castrating the rapists. The Times of India labelled the film a \"B-grade movie\", but further noted that \"Dimple nonetheless did a very convincing job of portraying her anguish and bitterness at being denied justice.\" M.L. Dhawan from The Tribune, while documenting the famous Hindi films of 1988, praised Kapadia for \"proving her mettle as an actress of intensity and passion.\" Subhash K. Jha, however, in an article discussing Indian actresses who have played policewomen, wrote that the film \"turned into quite an embarrassment for its leading lady.\" The three final years of the decade saw the release of several other films featuring Kapadia, but few did well. In 1987, she appeared in two action movies: Rajkumar Kohli's Insaniyat Ke Dushman and Mukul Anand's Insaaf, in which she played a dual role of a dancer and a physician. She worked with Kohli in two more movies in 1988, the horror film Bees Saal Baad and the action drama Saazish. In that same year Mahesh Bhatt cast her again in his action thriller Kabzaa, a critical failure. Ram Lakhan (1989), directed by Subhash Ghai, was a success with both critics and audiences, but Kapadia's role was considered small with one critic saying it did not do \"justice to her talent\" and another reporting that she \"pales into insignificance in the film.\" Other films of this period include Babbar Subhash's Pyar Ke Naam Qurbaan, opposite Mithun Chakraborty, and J.P. Dutta's action picture Batwara, opposite Dharmendra and Vinod Khanna. In the 1990s, Kapadia started venturing more into arthouse films, later citing an \"inner yearning to exhibit my best potential.\" Those films include Drishti (1990), Lekin... (1990), Rudaali (1993) and Antareen (1995). Drishti, a marital drama directed by Govind Nihalani, starred Kapadia and Shekhar Kapur as a married urban couple from an intellectual milieu in Mumbai and followed their trials and tribulations, extramarital affairs, divorce, and ultimate reconciliation after years of separation. Kapadia's part was that of career-woman Sandhya, and for her portrayal she was named the Best Actress (Hindi) of the year by the Bengal Film Journalists' Association. The film was acknowledged as the Best Hindi Film of that year at the annual National Film Awards. Frontline suggested that Kapadia's performance in the film should have earned her the Best Actress award at the same function. In Gulzar's Lekin..., she played a restless sprite named Reva, a role she has often cited as a personal favourite and wished would have had more screen time in the film. Referring to it once as \"the most fantastic\" part of her career, she recalled the working relationship with Gulzar as \"a wonderful experience\". To make her character more truthful, Gulzar did not let Kapadia blink even once during filming, trying to capture an \"endless, fixed gaze\" which would give her \"a feeling of being surreal.\" Lekin... was popular with critics and Kapadia's performance earned her a third Filmfare nomination. In 1991, she appeared in Prahaar: The Final Attack, the first directorial venture of actor Nana Patekar, with whom she would collaborate in several other films. The film, co-starring Patekar and Madhuri Dixit, received a welcome reception from critics. Kapadia was noted for her \"deglamourised role\", but most of the praise went to the performance of Patekar himself. Kapadia starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan in Shashi Kapoor's fantasy Ajooba, an Indo-Russian co-production based on Arabian mythology and set in the Afghan kingdom of Baharistan. She played Rukhsana, a young woman who comes from India to rescue her father, court magician Ameer Baba, from prison. The critical response to Ajooba was mostly lukewarm. She played the protagonist in Haque (1991), a political drama directed by Harish Bhosle and scripted by Mahesh Bhatt. Her role was that of Varsha B. Singh, a pregnant Orthodox woman married to an influential politician. Ram Awatar Agnihotri said of her performance, \"Dimple Khapadia, playing Varsha, very bravely, tries to make her role look convincing, and she succeeds to a great extent. It is a tribute to her as an actress\". 1992 saw the release of Maarg, her third appearance under Mahesh Bhatt's direction. The film was delayed for several years. She played the role of a prostitute, working by choice. Bhatt called her performance \"stunning\" and reported that when shooting ended, she was \"on the point of a breakdown\" as she was \"exhausted battling with the nitty-gritty of a whore's character\". She next played Barkha, a single woman who abandons her premarital daughter upon birth, in Hema Malini's directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai. In Shashilal K. Nair's Angaar, a crime drama based on the life of an underworld don, she played Mili, a homeless orphan collected by an unemployed man, played by Jackie Shroff. Angaar received positive reviews from critics, as did Kapadia's performance, but it was financially unsuccessful, which Meena Iyer of The Times of India\u2014who called it \"one of the most engaging mafia films to have come out of Bollywood\"\u2014attributed to its dark proceedings. In 1993, she won the National Film Award for Best Actress for her performance in Rudaali, a drama directed by Kalpana Lajmi. Kapadia played the central character of Shanichari, a lonely and hardened Assamese village woman who, throughout a lifetime of misfortune, has never cried and is now challenged with a new job as a professional mourner. The citation for the award described her performance as a \"compelling interpretation of the tribulations of a lonely woman ravaged by a cruel society\". Chandra Bhushan said of her character, \"Shanichari is dry like a desert but even she has a flavour, affection and audacity and courage to reject the enticement of Zamindar (the landlord).\" Aside from a third Filmfare nomination for Best Actress for the role, she won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress, and was acknowledged with Best Actress honours at the Asia Pacific Film Festival and the Damascus International Film Festival. In 2010 Filmfare magazine included her work in the film in their list of \"80 Iconic Performances\". Another Filmfare nomination for Kapadia came that year for her supporting role as Shanti, a street prostitute, in the Priyadarshan-directed drama Gardish. An adaptation of the 1989 Malayalam film Kireedam, the film starred, among others, Jackie Shroff and Amrish Puri. In 1994, Kapadia appeared in Mehul Kumar's Krantiveer, alongside Nana Patekar. She played journalist Meghna Dixit, a past rape victim who now tries to persuade an alcoholic and unemployed village man to be a champion of justice for those around him. Kapadia later called the film \"out and out a Nana Patekar vessel,\" but asserted, \"I had my share too,\" crediting the part with allowing her \"the freedom to perform\". The film became an economic success, emerging as India's third-highest grossing picture of the year. For her performance, Kapadia received her fourth Filmfare Award, this time in the Best Supporting Actress category. Mrinal Sen's 1995 Bengali drama Antareen was the first non-Hindi project Kapadia took part in since Vikram (1986). She played a woman caught in a loveless marriage. Insisting on playing her part spontaneously, Kapadia refused to enrol in a crash-course in Bengali as she wrongly felt that she would be able to speak it convincingly. Her voice was eventually dubbed by actor Anushua Chatterjee, something Kapadia was unhappy with. Following Antareen, Kapadia, who was reportedly expected to work in more independent films, took a three-year hiatus from acting, later explaining that she was \"emotionally exhausted\". She returned to commercial cinema in 1996, but the few films she did until the end of the decade met with neither mainstream nor critical success. Her first release in 1997 was the action film Agnichakra, which went unnoticed. She played Amitabh Bachchan's wife in that same year's Mrityudaata, once again under Mehul Kumar's direction. The film was a critical and commercial failure, with India Today panning its \"comic book-level storytelling\". Trade journal Film Information wrote Kapadia had \"no role worth her\", and she herself shared similar sentiments. She appeared in Laawaris (1999) because she liked the subject and considered her role \"substantial\", which Rediff.com, in turn, described as another preachy \"woman of substance\", while criticising the film for its lack of originality: \"working a worked-to-death formula, [the film] falls flat on its face. This was followed by the final feature she appeared in during the decade, Hum Tum Pe Marte Hain, in which she played the part of Devyani, the strict mother of a wealthy family. Subhash K. Jha called the film an \"embarrassment\", critic Suparn Verma, in a scathing review, criticised Kapadia's performance, noting that she \"wears a permanent scowl\" throughout the film, and Bella Jaisinghani of The Indian Express, calling the film \"inconsequential\", concluded her review writing that she wonders \"what made Dimple Kapadia do this to herself\". She co-starred in Farhan Akhtar's directorial debut Dil Chahta Hai (2001). Depicting the contemporary routine life of Indian affluent youth, it is set in modern-day urban Mumbai and focuses on a major period of transition in the lives of three young friends (Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna). Kapadia played the role of Tara Jaiswal, a middle-aged alcoholic woman, an interior designer by profession, and a divorcee who is not allowed to meet with her daughter. The film presents her story through the character of Siddharth (Khanna), a much younger man whom she befriends and who ultimately falls deeply in love with her. She said making the picture was an \"enriching\" experience and called her part \"a role to die for\". Critics lauded Dil Chahta Hai as a groundbreaking film for its realistic portrayal of Indian youth. The film performed well in the big cities but failed in the rural areas, which was attributed by critics to the urban-oriented lifestyle depicted in the movie. Saibal Chatterjee, in a review for Hindustan Times, noted, \"Dimple Kapadia, in a brief, somewhat underdeveloped role, presents a poignant study of loneliness.\" In 2002, Kapadia portrayed the title role of Leela in Leela, an American production directed by Somnath Sen and co-starring Deepti Naval, Vinod Khanna and Amol Mhatre. Kapadia's part\u2014written specially for her\u2014is that of a forty-year-old married woman and a Mumbai University professor, who, after the death of her mother, loses her sense of happiness and takes a job as a visiting professor of South Asian studies in California. The story follows Leela's acclimation to her new surroundings and particularly her relationship with one of her students there, Kris (Mhatre), a young Indian-American man. Kapadia noted about working in the film, \"While in production, I'm all tensed up, and that is what makes me take my acting to the next level.\" Maitland McDonagh from TV Guide wrote, \"Dimple Kapadia shines in this family melodrama\u00a0... [her] intelligent, nuanced performance is the film's highlight.\" Ziya Us Salam from The Hindu called her \"a charmer all the way. Exhilarating is the air she breathes, bewitching is the glance she casts and enticingly vulnerable is her condition.\" In 2004, she played the lead role of army wife Sandra Williams in Hum Kaun Hai?, a supernatural thriller. The film opened to a mixed critical reception, but Kapadia's performance received positive comments. Subhash K. Jha noted that she \"carries the film beyond where it would have been otherwise\"; Rama Sharma of The Tribune wrote of her performance, \"Dimple lends all her charisma to help the script sail through dead ends. Whether she is scared or scolding children, she has a powerful presence.\" 2005 saw Kapadia and Rishi Kapoor reunite as a lead couple for the third time after Bobby (1973) and Saagar (1985) in Pyaar Mein Twist. They starred as two middle-aged single parents who fall in love and later have to deal with the reaction of their children. The film generated mostly negative reviews, with several critics concurring that the chemistry between the lead pair is what makes the film watchable. In a two-star review, Khalid Mohamed called Kapadia \"a dream actress\", but ultimately concluded, \"See this twisteroo if you must, only for the undiminished Kapoor-Kapadia chemistry.\" Few people went to see the film; within two weeks it was declared a flop. In 2006, she co-starred with Saif Ali Khan and Naseeruddin Shah in the psychological drama Being Cyrus (2006), an English-language arthouse feature directed by Homi Adajania. Kapadia enacted the part of Katy, Shah's neurotic and unfaithful wife who runs an affair with Cyrus, a young man who enters their house as an assistant. Her work received varied comments. According to BBC's Poonam Joshi, \"The descent into despair of Dimple Kapadia's Katy is enthralling.\" Derek Elley from Variety, however, panned her for \"wildly overact[ing]\", with similar sentiments being shared by several critics, including Shradha Sukumaran from Mid Day, who labelled her performance \"over-the-top and jerky\". In V. K. Prakash's Phir Kabhi Kapadia and Mithun Chakraborty played ageing people who meet at a school reunion and rekindle their high-school romance. At the request of her son-in-law Akshay Kumar, she voiced the character of Devi, the mother of the title character of an elephant (voiced by Kumar) in the animated movie Jumbo (2008). Kapadia was cast in Zoya Akhtar's first directorial venture, Luck By Chance (2009), a satirical take on the Hindi film industry. She played the part of Neena Walia, an erstwhile superstar\u2014referred to in the film as \"a crocodile in a chiffon saree\"\u2014who struggles to launch her young daughter in the movie business. Luck By Chance opened to a warm critical response, though its financial income was modest. Critics were appreciative of Kapadia's performance, which earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at Filmfare. Deepa Karmalkar from Screen characterised her as \"gloriously bitchy\", while Sukanya Verma from Rediff hailed her as \"stunning, striking, storming\". Kapadia played the small part of Salman Khan's asthmatic mother in Dabangg (2010). With revenues of \u20b92.13\u00a0billion worldwide, the film was a huge commercial success, emerging as the popular film of the year in India as well as the second-highest grossing Hindi film of all-time up to that point. Reviews for Kapadia were mixed, with Shubhra Gupta writing that she is \"laughably wrong\". Tum Milo Toh Sahi, released the same year, was a mature love story, in which she starred as Delshad Nanji, a Parsi woman in charge of an Irani caf\u00e9, who falls in love with a man played by Nana Patekar. Kapadia employed a Parsi accent for the role and, while preparing for it, visited several Irani caf\u00e9s in Mumbai to understand their cultural basics and get into the mood of the character. The film opened to average reviews, but her performance received generally positive feedback, with several critics noting her chemistry with Patekar. Anupama Chopra, in a negative review, criticised her character, claiming it \"veers into caricature\", but wrote of Kapadia that she \"plays her with affection and energy and at least has some fun doing it.\" Kapadia's only film of 2011 was Nikhil Advani's Patiala House, a sports film revolving around cricket in which she was cast as Rishi Kapoor's wife and her son in-law, Akshay Kumar's mother. The role was small, with Times of India's Nikhat Kazmi commenting that she \"does end up a bit underutilised\". As of December 2011, Kapadia is set to appear in her third non-Hindi and first Malayalam-language film, Bombay Mittayi, for which she started learning the language. She plays the wife of a celebrated Ghazal singer, played by Amar Singh, on whose behest she was offered the part. Her starring film What the Fish was released on 13 December 2013. When Kapadia made her comeback to movies, she faced constant comparison to her Bobby days. According to Jyotika Virdi, author of the book The Cinematic Imagination, Kapadia trajectory is \"different from that of any female Hindi film star\", and she \"turned every disadvantage to her advantage.\" Virdi mentioned Kapadia's forthright manner as having a major contribution to her career: \"Speaking candidly to the press, she and the reporters plotted her life's narrative from the innocent teenager snared into an impossible marriage to the emergence of a mature 'woman with experience.'\" Virdi also noted Kapadia for \"fighting her way to the top, preferring to perform roles she described as serious and exacting rather than flippant and unchallenging,\" calling her parts in Aitbaar (1985), Kaash (1987) and Drishti (1990) as roles \"where she drew from the well of her own experience.\" Kapadia is known for her assertive and moody nature; during the making of Janbaaz (1986), director Feroz Khan remarked, \"No other girl has so much of pent-up aggression.\" Journalist Bhawana Somaaya, who conducted a series of interviews with her during the 1980s, stated, \"She's a strange bundle of contradictions. Her moods change in a jiffy.\" According to some critics, this approach has sometimes been at the cost of professional opportunities as \"her unpredictable nature and moods have distanced many well wishers\". In reply to this, and the said, \"I am moody by nature. But I have never consciously hurt anyone.\" According to Shobha D\u00e9, Kapadia \"hates being 'surveyed' and she finds herself in that unenviable situation all the time.\" Mahesh Bhatt, with whom she first worked in Kaash (1987), remarked that Kapadia \"has gone through so much in her life that she need not read up the text books of method acting to play a real woman.\" Speaking of her venture into art cinema years later, Bhatt commended her for not turning into \"a victim of her own success\" by refusing to become \"a part of the money-making machine\". Mrinal Sen, who directed her in Antareen (1994), compared her to Sophia Loren and described her face as \"a landscape of desolation\". According to Drishti (1990) director Govind Nihalani, Kapadia is \"genuinely interested in doing serious work, something that challenges her talent.\" Following her success with Rudaali, a 1993 edition of Asiaweek reported that by this time Kapadia had long been \"a critic's darling\". Dinesh Raheja from Rediff stated that Kapadia's involvement in art films happened at a time when she \"exhausted her appetite for playing the pretty prop in hero-oriented films\", arguing that they \"honed Dimple's talent for lending fine striations to complex emotions.\" According to Raheja, Kapadia's casting in Dil Chahta Hai and Leela, in which she played \"an older woman who is the object of a younger man's affection\" served as \"a kind of tribute to her eternal beauty.\" M.L. Dhawan from The Tribune commented, \"All those who have been following Dimple Kapadia's career from Bobby, Lekin and Rudaali will assert that she is more talented than glamorous.\" Ranjan Das Gupta calls her \"an instinctive actress, spontaneous and intelligent\" but he notes that her beauty is \"her asset as well as limitation\". Kapadia describes herself as \"a competent actress yet to deliver her best\"."

        "artist_name": "Divya_Bharti", 
        "biography": " Divya Om Prakash Bharti (25 February 1974 \u2013 5 April 1993) was an Indian film actress, who starred in a number of commercially successful Hindi and Telugu language films in the early 1990s. She went on to establish herself as a leading actress of 90s in a very short period of time. She was admired for her bubbly personality and vivacious nature. She was known for her versatility. Bharti aspired a career in films at an early age, and started to get offers at 14 years of age. After several unsuccessful attempts, she made her debut with a lead role in the successful Telugu drama Bobbili Raja (1990), aged 16. After featuring in a number of high-grossing Telugu films, she progressed to Bollywood films in 1992 with the action thriller Vishwatma. Bharti further went on to have commercial success alongside acclaimed actors such as Govinda and Rishi Kapoor in films like Shola Aur Shabnam and Deewana, respectively; the latter of which garnered her a Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. She acted in over 14 Hindi films between 1992 and 1993, which is to date an unbroken record in Hindi cinema. Bharti died on 5 April 1993, aged 19, from head injuries sustained after falling off the balcony of her fifth-floor apartment at Tulsi Buildings in Versova, Mumbai. It was never officially confirmed whether her death was murder, suicide, or accidental. Her parents called her death as an accident and the Mumbai Police closed the investigations into her death in 1998, labeling it as accidental.   Bharti was born in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) to Om Prakash Bharti, an insurance officer, and his wife, Meeta Bharti. She had a younger brother named Kunal and one half-sister Poonam who was the child of Bharti's father first marriage. She spoke Hindi, English, and Marathi fluently. In her early years, Bharti was known for her bubbly personality and for her doll-like looks. Actress Kainaat Arora is her second cousin. Bharti studied at Maneckji Cooper High School in Juhu, Mumbai. She was an average student and completed 9th standard before pursuing an acting career. In 1988, Bharti was discovered by filmmaker Nandu Tolani. Upon seeing her, Tolani insisted on signing her for one of his films. At that time, Bharti was in the ninth standard (in ninth grade). She was originally scheduled to make her screen debut in Gunahon Ka Devta in 1988, but her role was cancelled. Kirti Kumar noticed Bharti at a video library and thus was eager to sign her for his project Radha Ka Sangam opposite Govinda, as he was searching for a new face. Weeks later, Kumar met with Dilip Shankar and managed to release Bharti from her contract. After taking dancing and acting lessons for months to prepare for her role, Bharti was eventually dropped and replaced by Juhi Chawla. Though the reasons remain unclear, it was speculated that Kumar's possessiveness over Bharti and her childish nature was the cause of her replacement. Bharti's career was stalled until D. Ramanaidu, Telugu film producer, offered her Bobbili Raja opposite his son Daggubati Venkatesh. Without hoping for success after experiencing a lot of failures in Bollywood, she commenced shooting for her screen debut in Andhra Pradesh. The film was released in the summer of 1990 and became a colossal hit. Bobbili Raja remains to this day one of the most popular Telugu movies. Bharti acted in only one Tamil film, Nila Penne opposite Anand. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. With more hits in the Telugu cinema, Bharti established herself as one of the most popular actresses in Telugu.[not in citation given] In box-office ratings, she figured next to Vijayshanti. In 1991, Bharti had back-to-back hits, including Rowdy Alludu and Assembly Rowdy opposite actors Chiranjeevi and Mohan Babu. Later that year, Bharti began filming A. Kodandarami Reddy's action romance Dharma Kshetram under Sri Rajeev Productions. Bharti got to work for Telugu film actor Nandamuri Balakrishna. While Bharti celebrated her success in Andhra Pradesh, Bollywood's top directors were eager to sign the Telugu superstar for their upcoming films. Bharti's first Bollywood film was Vishwatma opposite Sunny Deol, directed by Rajiv Rai, and released 2 January 1992. The film was an average grosser at the box office and gained Bharti wider recognition from the public as well as film critics. Notably, the music of the film was very successful, especially the song \"Saat Samundar\" which became a favorite and put Bharti in the limelight of Bollywood. A week later, Bharti's next film, Lawrence D'Souza's romantic drama Dil Ka Kya Kasoor, alongside Prithvi released. Though the film failed at the box office, it brought her name in the Filmfare magazine's \"Top Ten Best Actress Performances\" of 1992. The movie was also recognized for its outstanding music. But after the failure of the film at the box office, she was quoted as saying, \"I wanted to prove myself. But I've fallen flat on my face. Now, I have to begin my climb all over again. Yet, I'm positive that one day, success will be mine.\" (Stardust, March 1992). In March 1992, David Dhawan's Shola Aur Shabnam was released. It was popular with critics and was a box office hit in India, reviving Bharti's career once again. She received a Lux Face of the Year title. It also gave a big boost to Govinda's career and launched David Dhawan as an established director. Shortly after, Bharti achieved further success in Raj Kanwar's Filmfare-award-winning love story Deewana starred veteran actor Rishi Kapoor and newcomer Shahrukh Khan, which is regarded as one of the biggest blockbuster hits of 1992. Her performance in Deewana was highly appreciated. Critics reported that Bharti belonged to a new breed of Hindi film actors who broke away from character stereotypes. Bharti and Shahrukh Khan won the Filmfare Award for Lux New Face of the Year and Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut respectively. By July 1992, Bharti's work in Deewana was said to have earned her more recognition. She had several other releases that year, among them Jaan Se Pyaara which featured Bharti alongside Govinda once again, Geet opposite Avinash Wadhawan, Dushman Zamana alongside Armaan Kohli and Balwaan which marked the debut of Sunil Shetty. The latter being a low budget film, achieved moderate success. In October, Hema Malini's Dil Aashna Hai, again opposite Shahrukh Khan was released which didn't do as well at the box office. Divya's performance as a bar dancer who sets out to find her birth mother was however appreciated. Bharti decided to act in one Telugu movie per year in order to not disappoint her Telugu audience. Thus, Chittamma Mogudu was released at the end of 1992, starring once again the popular couple of Bharti and Mohan Babu.[citation needed] The ensemble film Kshatriya in which she co-starred alongside Sunny Deol, Sanjay Dutt and Raveena Tandon was the last film to be released during Bharti's lifetime. She died only a week after its release. Bharti met Sajid Nadiadwala through Govinda at the shooting of Shola Aur Shabnam. Soon both Bharti and Nadiadwala fell in love with each other. Bharti married Nadiadwala on 10 May 1992. She converted to Islam after her marriage and changed her name to Sana Nadiadwala. On 5 April 1993, around 11 PM, Bharti fell off the balcony of her fifth floor apartment at the Tulsi buildings in Versova, Mumbai. After neighbours discovered her, she was rushed in an ambulance to the emergency department at Cooper Hospital where doctors failed to revive her. The immediate cause of death was stated as the heavy internal bleeding at the back of the head which was severely damaged The reason of falling was never established and several theories circulated in the media during that time, including falling under influence of alcohol, push by someone, suicide, and involvement of her husband and underworld mafia. The investigation was closed in 1998 by Mumbai police and reason of death was stated as accidental death. She was cremated on 7 April 1993 at the Vile Parle crematorium, Mumbai. Two of Bharti's completed films Rang and Shatranj were released several months after her death. She had completed more than half of Laadla when she died. Later Sridevi was recast in her role. She was replaced in several other films she had signed such as Mohra, Kartavya, Vijaypath and Andolan. Her incomplete Telugu film Tholi Muddhu was partly completed by Indian actress Rambha, who slightly resembled Bharti and hence completed a few scenes of the movie for her. Two movies which she had signed were subsequently shelved, Parinaam with Akshay Kumar and Chaal Pe Chaal with Jackie Shroff. A film, Love Behind The Border based on the life of Divya Bharti was in the pipeline, but was never made."

        "artist_name": "Durga_Khote", 
        "biography": " Durga Khote (14 January 1905 \u2212 22 September 1991) was an Indian actress, starting as one of the foremost leading ladies of her times, she remained active in Hindi and Marathi cinema, as well as theatre, for over 50 years, starring in around 200 films and numerous theatre productions. In 2000, in a millennium issue, India Today named her among \"100 People Who Shaped India\", noting, \"Durga Khote marks the pioneering phase for woman in Indian Cinema\" as she was one of the first women from respectable families to enter the film industry, thus breaking a social taboo. She also ranks among the top ten actresses in mother roles in Hindi cinema, most notable among them were as Jodhabai in K. Asif's Mughal-e-Azam (1960), as Kaikeyi in Vijay Bhatt's classic, Bharat Milap (1942); her other memorable roles as mother were in Charnon Ki Dasi (1941), Mirza Ghalib, Bobby (1973) and Bidaai (1974). She was received the highest award in Indian cinema, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award (1983), for lifetime contribution to Indian cinema.   She was born as Vita Laud, to a family which hailed from Goa and spoke Konkani at home. Her father's name was Pandurang Laud and her mother's name was Manjulabai. She grew up in a large joint family in Kandewadi. She was educated at Cathedral High School and St. Xavier's College where she studied B.A. While still in college, she married into the Khote family, graduated and settled down with her husband. By the age of 26, Durga Khote was a widowed mother with two young sons, Bakul and Harin. She had to seek work in film to support her children. In doing so, she became a pioneer of sorts: She hailed from a traditional family and the film industry was regarded as the preserve of the base and the bawdy. Also, most of the female characters were played by men at the time. Durga Khote debuted in a minor role in an obscure 1931 silent film, Farebi Jaal, by the Prabhat Film Company, followed by Maya Machindra (1932). She was soon promoted to play heroine in the 1932 double version (Hindi and Marathi) Ayodhyecha Raja, another Prabhat film, which was the first-ever Marathi talkie and proved to be a runaway hit, where she played the role of Rani Taramati. Indeed, she ventured yet another pioneering trend: Despite working closely with Prabhat Film Company, she broke away from the \"studio system\" (exclusive contract with a studio to work in its films on a monthly salary) then in vogue and became one of the first \"freelance\" artistes of that era by working occasionally with the New Theatres, East India Film Co. (both at Calcutta), and Prakash Pictures. In 1936, she played Saudamini in Amar Jyoti, which is one of her most \"memorable\" roles. In 1937, she produced and directed a film titled Saathi, making her one of the first women to step into this role in Indian cinema. The 40s opened for her in a big way, with award-winning performances in Aachary Atre's Payachi Dasi(Marathi) and Charnon Ki Dasi (Hindi) (1941) and Vijay Bhatt's classic, Bharat Milap (1942), both of which got her the BFJA Best Actress Award for two consecutive years. Durga Khote remained active in theatre circuit for many years, especially the Marathi theatre in Mumbai. She was actively associated with the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA) and worked in several plays for the Mumbai Marathi Sahitya Sangh. In 1954, she famously performed the role of Lady Macbeth, in V.V. Shirwadkar's Marathi adaptations of Macbeth, as Rajmukut, The Royal Crown, along with Nanasaheb Phatak. Durga Khote played a wide variety of roles over a career that was not only long but also untouched by scandal. She was the inspiration for several generations of Indian actresses, including veterans like the late Shobhna Samarth, who frequently spoke of how she had been inspired by Khote's example. During later years, she played several important character roles, such as the mother of the protagonist. Her portrayal of Jodhabai, the queen of Akbar torn between duty towards her husband and love towards her son in Mughal-e-Azam (1960) was well received. She went on to play other widely appreciated character roles in later movies such as the role of the grandmother of the heroine in Bobby (1973), the hero's aunt in Abhimaan (1973), and the really memorable Bidaai (1974), where she played a mother, a very sensitive role that can make one cry and received the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award. Her another role which is unforgettable was from film KARZ where she played the role of mother for Raj Kiran and after death of Raj Kiran , mother role to Rishi Kapoor as reincarnation born. Her performance in film KARZ was simply salutable. In 1963, she acted in Merchant Ivory's debut film, The Householder (1963), and her final memorable role was in Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Bawarchi (1972). She acted in over 200 films in her career. By the 1980s she successfully diversified into production of short films, ad films and documentaries by setting up Fact Films and, later, Durga Khote Productions, which produced the Doordarshan TV series Wagle Ki Duniya. Her two sons Bakul and Harin were born from her first marriage with Vishwanath Khote. It was a traditional marriage into an orthodox family. Vishwanath Khote was from a millionaire family who were, at that time, the largest share brokers and road contractors. Vishwanath was a mechanical engineer from Banaras Hindu University who died young. After she was widowed, Khote had an unsuccessful second marriage to Mohammed Rashid.[not in citation given] Harin himself died at a young age, and was survived by his wife, Vijaya Mehta and two sons. Her grandchildren include Ravi, a filmmaker; granddaughter Anjali Khote; grandson Deven Khote, a television producer, and a noted film producer, making films like Jodhaa Akbar and Life in a Metro. Sharda Mukherjee, the ex governor of Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh and wife of India's first air chief marshal Subroto Mukherjee was her first cousin (mother's sister's daughter). Sharda Mukherjee's paternal uncle Ranjit Sitaram Pandit was married to Jawaharlal Nehru's sister Vijaylaxmi Pandit. Her brother-in-law, Nandu Khote, was a noted stage and silent movie actor. His daughter Shubha Khote acted in Hindi films; debuting in Seema (1955), she later directed and produced Marathi films and entered television in the 90s. Viju Khote, most known for his role of Kalia in Sholay (1975) is a noted character actor, and younger brother of Shubha. Shubha's daughter, Bhavna Balsaver, is an award-winning TV actress. They appeared together in 1993's sitcom Zabaan Sambhalke on DD Metro. Later in life she wrote her acclaimed autobiography in Marathi which was later translated into English as I, Durga Khote, and moved to Alibaug, near Mumbai. She died on 22 September 1991. A postage stamp, bearing her face, was released by India Post to honour her on 3 May 2013."

        "artist_name": "Esha_Deol", 
        "biography": " Esha Deol (born 2 November 1981) is an Indian film actress and model who predominantly appears in Hindi films. Daughter of actors Dharmendra and Hema Malini, Deol made her debut in Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe (2002) and was praised for her performance which earned her numerous awards and nominations including the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. She earned critical acclaim for her performance and was part of commercially successesful films like LOC Kargil (2003), Yuva (2004), Dhoom (2004), Insan (2005), Kaal (2005), Main Aisa Hi Hoon (2005), Dus (2005), No Entry (2005), Shaadi No. 1 (2005) and Cash (2007). She made her comeback in Tell Me O Kkhuda (2011). She starred opposite prominent actors like Ajay Devgn, Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan.   Born to famous Bollywood actress of Tamil origin Hema Malini and Bollywood actor of Punjabi origin Dharmendra. She has a younger sister Ahana Deol. Her older half siblings are Bobby Deol, Sunny Deol, Vijayta and Ajeeta, through her father's first marriage to Prakash Kaur. Deol attended Mithibai College in Mumbai where she planned to become a fashion designer. Deol trained in the Odissi dancing style under Mumbai guru Rabindra Atibuddhi. She was trained by and performs classical Bharatanatyam dance with her mother. Deol decided to join the acting line of her parents and became a second-generation actress. She started her acting career in a lead role with Vinay Shukla's Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe (2002) opposite Aftab Shivdasani, with Sanjay Kapoor, Jaya Bachchan and Anupam Kher playing supporting roles. This movie was a box office failure. Deol received mixed reactions from critics upon her performance. Savera R Someshwar of Rediff wrote \"Esha, as a person, exudes a confidence that almost borders on arrogance. She's athletic and seems perfectly capable of looking after herself in any situation. Esha, on screen, is required to convey three emotions: Love, sorrow and fear. Especially fear. No wonder she flounders. She is just unable to look terrorised. Even her alleged romance with costar Aftab has not helped her shed her stern demeanour in her romantic scenes.\" Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood wrote \"She isn\u2019t horrible, but given the hype, the demands and of course, comparisons, she surely isn\u2019t up to the mark. Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe is just plain old mediocre in such a way that you end up noticing the flaws in Esha\u2019s performance more. Her facial expressions need work, her attitude is beautiful but she seems too stern when it is not required. Of course, she is nowhere close to being a washout and if you are her fan you can appreciate the other aspects of her performances without completely losing faith in her future projects.\" Despite mixed reactions and box office failure, Deol won numerous awards for her performance including the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut at the 48th Filmfare Awards. Deol's second film was Arjun Sablok's love triangle Na Tum Jaano Na Hum opposite Saif Ali Khan and Hrithik Roshan. The film flopped at the box office. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFm praised her acting and wrote \"it is Esha Deol who surprises you with a mature performance. Although her looks are inconsistent, the youngster takes on the role with utmost sincerity and comes out with a natural performance. She has been better presented when compared to her debut film.\" Bhavna Giani of Rediff praised Deol's acting and dancing and compared it to Deol's mother Hema Malini. Giani wrote \"As far as performances go, Esha is quite good, emoting clearly with her eyes. She makes the transition from bubbly schoolgirl to young woman waiting for her love easily. Her grace fills the screen. Dancing seems to come as naturally to her as it does to Hritik. A carbon copy of her mother Hema Malini, one cannot help but feel one is watching the Dream Girl all over again.\" Deol's third and final release of the year was Sanjay Chhel's Kyaa Dil Ne Kahaa opposite Tusshar Kapoor. It was Deol's third consecutive flop but she earned critical acclaim and Taran Adarsh observed that it was her better performance as compared to her previous two films. Deol's first two movies of 2003: Kucch To Hai and Chura Liyaa Hai Tumne were box office failures. For Kucch To Hai, Deol earned mixed reviews from Taran Adarsh, who wrote \"Esha Deol shows improvement in terms of performance as well as her overall appearance.\" Taran Adarsh considered Deol to be \"alright\" in Chura Liyaa Hai Tumne. Ronjita Kulkarni praised her performance in Chura Liyaa Hai Tumne, writing \"Chura Liya... was supposed to give Esha a makeover and re-launch her. Strangely, her role is similar to her debut, Koi Mere Dil Se Pooche. While the former had her terrified of her husband, Chura Liya... sees her terrified of three gangsters. The film gives her ample scope for histrionics, but she does not utilise it. Her dialogue delivery is good, but her performance is hyper.\" Deol was one of the heroines of J.P. Dutta's multi starrer war epic LOC Kargil and was paired with Abhishek Bachchan. Though Deol and all the other heroines could not get much scope, she earned critical acclaim for her performance. The film became the sixth highest-grossing movie of the year. In 2004, Deol made her debut in Tamil cinema by playing a French teacher in Mani Ratnam's political film Aayutha Ezhuthu opposite Suriya. She earned critical acclaim for her performance. Sify.com defined her as \"surprisingly fresh and sparkling\". In order to prepare for her role, Deol learned nuances of the language with Mani Ratnam's assistant R. Kannan. After completing Aayutha Ezhuthu, Deol started filming the Hindi version of the movie titled Yuva. In Yuva, Deol repeated the same role and was paired opposite Ajay Devgn. Prem Panicker of Rediff wrote \"Esha Deol is the surprise package among the troika. While hers is the least developed character, she still manages to show flashes of her inherited acting genes.\" Taran Adarsh wrote \"Esha Deol justifies her part, but her role doesn't demand histrionics either.\" Both movies were released on the same date but could not attain success. Yuva had a below average opening and flopped at the box office. Deol finally got her breakthrough with Yash Raj Films' action film Dhoom opposite Abhishek Bachchan, John Abraham, Uday Chopra and Rimi Sen. It was Deol's first action role and she was paired opposite Chopra. The film had a decent opening and became a hit at the box office, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing movie at the box office. Deol did not get much scope in the film but her performance earned her a nomination for the IIFA Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 6th IIFA Awards. Critics considered Deol and Rimi Sen's performances to be nothing more than beauties and their purpose was defined as providing sex appeal. Surjyakiran Das of Planet Bollywood wrote \"It\u2019s most fitting to mention actresses Esha Deol and Rimi Sen while discussing the music and choreography; they seem to turn up in the film only when the heroes feel like crooning a tune and shaking a leg with a loved one. Both actresses do convincing enough work in their roles, but their real purpose is to provide sex appeal.\" Rajesh Karkera wrote \"Esha Deol and Rimii Sen only need to look beautiful in their limited presence in this sweat 'n' leather flick.\" After the success of Dhoom, Deol starred in Krishna Vamsi's war film Insan opposite Akshay Kumar. It was Deol's first release of 2005. The film was a failure at the box office. Her next release was Main Aisa Hi Hoon opposite Ajay Devgn. The film was a remake of the critically acclaimed Hollywood movie I Am Sam (2001). Deol played a supporting role and earned praise by Patcy N. Subhash K. Jha of IANS also praised Deol, writing \"Esha Deol as the fey unstable nomadic and maladjusted Maya is a mix of Zeenat Aman in Hare Rama Hare Krishna and Anooradha Patel in Ijaazat. Playing this zonked-out character Esha Deol comes into her own as an actress. Her far-way looks of pain anger neglect and insecurity remain with you long after the film. Yup she too has matured along with Hindi cinema.\" In 2007, Deol's portrayal of a notorious and vengeful ghost for Ram Gopal Verma's Darling was reviewed positively. Taran Adarsh noted that, \"Esha Deol is excellent in a role that\u2019s nothing short of a challenge. It would\u2019ve boomeranged had it been entrusted to any inferior actor, but Esha is in terrific form here. This should be the turning point in her career.\" Her next release was Cash again opposite Ajay Devgn. In 2008, she performed her first item number in Ajay Devgn's film Sunday. She further appeared in Hijack and took a sabbatical break from films for two years. Deol's next film was Tell Me O Kkhuda (2011) directed and produced by her mother Hema Malini. She portrayed the lead role in the film opposite Arjan Bajwa, Vinod Khanna, Rishi Kapoor and her father Dharmendra. Esha Deol was born in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India on 2 November 1981. She was given the full name of Esha Dharmendra Deol. The name 'Esha' comes from the Upanishads and is derived from the Sanskrit language meaning \"the divine beloved\". She is the elder daughter of Bollywood actors Dharmendra and Hema Malini. She has a younger sister named Ahana. She is the half sister of actors Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol and first cousin of actor Abhay Deol. She is Punjabi on her father's side and Tamil on her mother's side and speaks Tamil with her mother and sister. She is fluent in English, Hindi and Tamil. During her school days, she was passionate about football and played as a midfielder.[citation needed] She was the captain of her school football team, represented her college in handball at the state level and was also selected for the Indian national women's football team. Esha Deol got engaged to her boyfriend Bharat Takhtani, a businessman on 12 February 2012 and married on 29 June 2012."

        "biography": " Farhan Akhtar (born 9 January 1974) is an Indian film director, screenwriter, producer, actor, playback singer, lyricist and television host. Born in Mumbai to screenwriters Javed Akhtar and Honey Irani, he grew up under the influence of the Hindi film industry. He began his career in Bollywood by working as an assistant director in Lamhe (1991) and Himalay Putra (1997). Akhtar, after establishing a production company named Excel Entertainment along with Ritesh Sidhwani, made his directorial debut with Dil Chahta Hai (2001) and received critical acclaim for portraying modern youth. The film also won a National award. Following it, he made Lakshya (2004) and had his Hollywood debut through the soundtrack of Bride and Prejudice (2004), for which he wrote the lyrics. He went on to make the commercially successful Don (2006). He directed a short-film titled Positive (2007) to spread awareness on HIV-AIDS. He started his acting career with Rock On!! (2008), for which he won a second National Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi as producer, and indulged in further experimentation before he acted in, produced and wrote the dialogues for the critical and commercial success Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011), which won him two Filmfare Awards, including Best Supporting Actor. In the same year, he directed a sequel to Don titled Don 2 (2011), which remains as his highest-grossing film till date. He achieved further success by portraying Milkha Singh in the 2013 film Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, earning him the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 2016, Akhtar received praise for starring in the crime thriller Wazir and the comedy drama Dil Dhadakne Do.   Farhan Akhtar was born to screenwriters Javed Akhtar and Honey Irani in Mumbai. His sister is writer\u2013director Zoya Akhtar. His parents divorced during his early days, and his father married Shabana Azmi in 1984. Akhtar has termed his parents as the \"harshest\" critics in his career, and also considered Robert De Niro as an \"inspiration\" in the film industry. Akhtar is of Zoroastrian Parsi origin, from his mother's side. Akhtar grew up in an agnostic environment and along with his sister Zoya and father Javed Akhtar, he does not believe in any religion. His great grand father, Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi, a scholar of Islamic studies and theology, notably edited the first diwan of Mirza Ghalib on his request, and later became an important figure during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 in his native Khairabad. He is great-grandson of renowned Urdu poet Muztar Khairabadi and grandson of Jan Nisar Akhtar. He is also the cousin of Farah Khan and Sajid Khan. He did his schooling from Maneckji Cooper school in Mumbai and went on to study a law degree from the HR College, also in Mumbai, during which he was dismissed from the institution in his second year due to lack of attendance.[citation needed] He married Adhuna Bhabani in 2000, after being in a relationship with her for 3 years. They first met during the filming of his directorial debut Dil Chahta Hai in 2001 which also marked Adhuna's debut as a Bollywood hairstylist. The couple have two daughters named Shakya and Akira. On January 21, 2016 the couple officially announced their separation after 16 years of marriage. Akhtar worked as an apprentice in cinematography and direction for Yash Chopra's Lamhe (1991) when he was 17 years old and later shifted to an advertisement production house named 'Script Shop' to spend an approximate 3 years there. He also assisted Pankaj Parashar as a director in Himalay Putra (1997) before launching himself into direction and writing. Akhtar made his writing and directorial debut with the critically acclaimed film Dil Chahta Hai (2001), produced by Excel Entertainment Pvt. Ltd., a production company he established along with Ritesh Sidhwani in 1999. It was shot over a period of three months in Sydney, Goa and Mumbai. Due to its acclaim, he called it a \"turning point\" in his career. The film dealt with the lives of westernised urban youth in Mumbai. Akhtar had written the script based on his trips to Goa and New York, as well as a narration of a story outline by a friend of his. After its release, the film failed to do well at the box office by taking up a 'below average' opening and proceeded to become an 'average' grosser. However, it received international critical acclaim and attained an iconic status, with Akhtar receiving credit for starting a \"new wave\" in Indian cinema. Critic Ziya Us Salam praised Akhtar's direction and commented for The Hindu: \"In his maiden venture, Javed Akhtar's son shows enough glimpses of his pedigree to indicate that promise will attain fulfilment sooner than later.\" Various award shows conferred accolades on the film and nominated it for several categories. The year's National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi for 2002 was won by the film. It was also screened at the International Film Festival of India, the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and the Austin Film Festival. In the same year, he and his sister Zoya Akhtar assisted their father in writing the English lyrics of a song in Lagaan, for which the soundtrack was scored by A. R. Rahman. Akhtar's next project was Lakshya (2004), a film about an aimless youngster finally setting a goal for himself, starring Hrithik Roshan and Preity Zinta. It was shot in Ladakh, Dehra Dun and Mumbai, and marked the beginning of the collaborations between Akhtar and Hrithik. He had to research the army before writing the script and directing the venture. The theme of the film, as stated by Akhtar, was about \"finding oneself\". He also believed that if the same characters and situation were set elsewhere, the main core of the story would remain the same as the film was not about war, as it had been reported. Post-release, the film failed to make a mark at the box office and became a commercial failure. Parul Gupta of The Times of India gave it a negative review and explained that \"It's hard to reconcile to such triviality when it comes from Farhan Akhtar, considered the ultimate symbol of cool in Hindi filmdom.\" On the contrary, Manish Gajjar from BBC wrote, in his positive review, \"Young Farhan Akhtar, proves yet again that he is one of the finest directors Bollywood has to date. He has paid full attention to the script and the technical aspects, giving rise to a polished product\". Meanwhile, Akhtar wrote the English lyrics of Gurinder Chadha's Hollywood film, Bride and Prejudice (2004) along with his sister, Zoya Akhtar after being recommended by his father. The music for the film was composed by Anu Malik and consisted of a mixture of Hindi songs, West side story, Fiddler on the Roof and Grease. In 2006, Akhtar directed, produced and wrote the screenplay of Don starring Shah Rukh Khan in the title role, a remake of the 1978 film Don, starring Amitabh Bachchan. It marked his first project holding the status of a remake. The character of Don became iconic and popular. Despite so, he noted that he did not mean to be a \"torchbearer of the remake brigade\" and did not feel comfortable with being credited for the trend of remakes in the film industry. The film released on 20 October 2006 and was declared as a \"hit\" at the box office, grossing around \u20b9105 crore worldwide. It became widely known for its dialogues. However, critics predominantly condemned Akhtar's direction and screenplay. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama said Akhtar had \"climbed the ladder as far as craftsmanship is concerned [every frame is well decorated and makes a spellbinding impact] but despite a readymade classic at his disposal, the storyteller just doesn't get it right this time.\" In 2007, Akhtar produced the film Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd., directed by debutant Reema Kagti and starring Abhay Deol, Minissha Lamba, Shabana Azmi and Boman Irani. The music for the film was composed by Vishal-Shekhar, marking their first collaboration with him. Akhtar was supposed to make his acting debut with the project, but he had to be replaced by Abhay Deol as he was involved with Don. The film was financed and funded by Exim Bank. This was the first time Excel Entertainment collaborated with a different director as all their previous projects had been involving Farhan as a director. The story of the film revolved around six couples who went to Goa on a honeymoon. The film opened up on 23 February and received mixed reviews from critics, and ended up with an 'average' box office result. In the same year, Akhtar directed Positive, a film produced by Shernaz Italia and Frenzy Kodaiji, starring Boman Irani and Shabana Azmi. It was a short-film running for 12 minutes. Dealing with a family's attitude towards a person suffering from HIV-AIDS, the film was shot in Mumbai and aimed at creating awareness about the problem. It also introduced Arjun Mathur in the film industry. Speaking about the purpose of the project, Akhtar stated that \"Just as a social stigma, many people believe that an HIV patient should be isolated. They also have certain misconceptions about dealing with the disease. And since India has a lot of joint families; it becomes very important for them to understand the value of support to the person who has acquired this disease. This is exactly what Positive talks about.\" The film had its background score composed by Ram Sampath but no soundtrack. It was a part of the 'AIDS JaaGo' ('AIDS Awake'), a series of four short films, directed by Mira Nair, Santosh Sivan, Vishal Bhardwaj and himself, in a joint initiative of Mira Nair's Mirabai Films, voluntary organisations Avahan and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Akhtar's first project in 2011 was the drama thriller Game, directed by Abhinay Deo. The lead cast consisted of Abhishek Bachchan, Kangana Ranaut, Boman Irani and Jimmy Shergill. He wrote the dialogues and produced the venture. The film received highly negative reviews after release, with critics panning almost all the aspects of it. At the box office, it had a poor opening, and later resulted in giving losses for the distributors, due to a heavily negative word-of-mouth. It was described as a \"washout\" by trade analysts. Later that year, Akhtar wrote, produced and directed Don 2, a sequel to his 2006 Don. It marked his return to direction after a gap of nearly 5 years. His decision of making a sequel was explained by him in an interview, \"I am wary of sequels having to be made. With Don 2 I could finally make an action thriller the way I wanted to. Good story, classic action and simple plot which has one goal and work towards it effectively and dramatically.\" The film was a major success in India and went on to become the year's highest-grossing Bollywood production abroad with a worldwide gross of \u20b9210 crore., It received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with Khalid Mohammed stating, \"Throughout, you can\u2019t help feeling that Farhan Akhtar could have made three far more valuable films out of the budget squandered on this thriller where cars are smashed as if they were tea cups.\" Next year, Akhtar produced and wrote the dialogues of the neo-noir thriller Talaash: The Answer Lies Within. His production work was followed by the comedy films: Fukrey (2013) and Bangistan (2015). In 2008, Akhtar made his acting and singing debut in a musical film titled Rock On!!, for which he wrote the dialogues and also produced. The film was directed by Abhishek Kapoor. Prachi Desai, Arjun Rampal and Purab Kohli co-starred along with him. As he had been learning guitar ever since the start of his directing career, he had been well-versed with it and used it for the film. The role played by him was that of Aditya, lead singer of the rock band \"Magik\". He sang five songs from the soundtrack album. The film was acclaimed by critics and received positive reviews upon release. Gaurav Malani of The Economic Times wrote that the film seemed to be \"clearly designed by Farhan Akhar as his own acting debut and he doesn't let himself down. Lending voice to all his songs helps him to get into his character with effortless ease. One could certainly overlook the lisp in his dialogue delivery.\" Manish Gajjar of BBC wrote of his performance: \"Director-turned-actor, Farhan Aktar surprises all with his superb, flawless performance, transforming from a hippy-style lead-singer to a subdued, dismal workaholic banker.\" Akhtar received several accolades for his debut performance. The film, in addition won the National Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. However, it did not create an impact at the box office and turned out to be an 'average' grosser. After refusing an offer to sing a song for A. R. Rahman's album Blue, Akhtar acted in, and produced his sister Zoya's directorial and written debut, Luck By Chance which had Hrithik Roshan and Konkona Sen Sharma in the lead roles. He was cast in the film after being deemed as a \"perfect choice\" for it. The story of the film revolved around a struggling actor who arrives in Mumbai to become a film star. It was released on 30 January 2009. Though failing to do well at the box office and being declared as a \"flop\", the film received generally positive reviews from critics. Neil Genzlinger from The New York Times said: \"It is Mr. Akhtar whose understated performance holds together this far-ranging, cameo-filled film. He manages to remain sympathetic even while wreaking romantic havoc.\" Rajeev Masand noted: \"Farhan Akhtar delivers a simple-enough likeable performance that is just what the film required\u00a0\u2014 no showy flourishes, no loud outbursts, just a straight off spontaneous act that works like a dream.\" Following Luck By Chance, Akhtar acted in a project titled The Fakir of Venice, which was initially scheduled to release before Rock on!! and was supposed to be his acting debut. Due to several delays, it was released in mid-2009. It was written and directed by Anand Surapur, and accepted by Akhtar after he described its script as \"very powerful\", while emphasising that it \"touches upon weaknesses and confusions in all human beings.\" Before release, it premiered at the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles, and the Venice Film Festival at the ArcLight Hollywood. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film and felt that \"Akhtar, a producer, director and writer making his film debut here as an actor, is talented and handsome enough\u00a0\u2013 and with looks that could translate into any number of ethnicities\u00a0\u2013 to have a huge career ahead of him.\" Akhtar acted in, and produced his next film, Karthik Calling Karthik (2010), a psychological thriller directed by Vijay Lalwani. He played Karthik, an introvert character, starring alongside Deepika Padukone for the first time. Preparation for the role involved working on the Rubik's Cube, which he learnt from the director. The film received mixed reviews and praise for Akhtar's acting from critics, with Sukanya Verma highlighting that \"He conveys the anxiety, simplicity and frailty of Karthik even when the script isn't doing it for him. Perhaps it's his innate filmmaker instinct.\" The film had a good opening at the box office, as it was targeted towards the youth of the multiplexes. However, it failed to continue on its business and went on to become a 'below average' grosser. Akhtar produced and appeared as one of the three leads in his sister, Zoya Akhtar's coming-of-the-age film Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara along with Hrithik Roshan and Abhay Deol, Katrina Kaif and Kalki Koechlin, starring opposite Ariadna Cabrol. He was also credited as the dialogue writer for the film. He was the first actor to be cast in the film, and described his role as a \"fun character\" and a \"guy who for the longest time takes nothing seriously.\" His real life father, Javed Akhtar wrote poetry for the film, which he performs as a voice-over. His performance was favourably received by critics, with Shaikh Ayaz of Rediff.com highlighting his dialogues as \"gentle, they won't make you ROFL; they are more like tender dig in the ribs.\" Kaveree Bamzai of India Today called his acting as \"sensitive, soulful\", further saying that he was \"perfectly capable of reading out his father's poetry.\" The film made \u20b9153 crore worldwide and was declared as a commercial success at the box office. It also became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films overseas, earning around US$7.25 million. It won two National Awards, for the Best Choreography and Best Audiography. Following Don 2, Akhtar was signed up for the biopic Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. He plays the role of Milkha Singh. For his role, he had to undergo a training phase at the gym and study the character of Milkha Singh by researching his body language. He also had to prepare his looks to depict a 17-year-old army recruit and endure an on-the-spot preparation at an army cantonment. In 2014, Akhtar acted for the romantic comedy Shaadi Ke Side Effects alongside Vidya Balan, a film directed by Saket Chaudhary and produced by Pritish Nandy. It was a sequel to Pyaar Ke Side Effects (2006). Next year, Akhtar featured in the supporting role in his sister Zoya Akhtar's Dil Dhadakne Do, an ensemble comedy-drama starring Anil Kapoor, Shefali Shah, Priyanka Chopra, Ranveer Singh and Anushka Sharma. In 2016, Akhtar played the lead role of an Anti Terrorist Squad officer in Bejoy Nambiar's Wazir. It was his first action role as an actor, and for which he went through intense physical training and put on eight kilograms of weight. Raja Sen in his review called him \"pretty good [..] early on in the film, but his performance starts to unravel once the film hits hysterical gear and he is required to do more than frown.\" Akhtar also sang the duet \"Atrangi yaari\" with Amitabh Bachchan for Wazir. The film was a box-office success. Akhtar's final release of the year was the rock musical drama Rock On 2, a sequel to the 2008 critically acclaimed Rock On!!. He reprised his role of Aditya Shroff, the lead singer of his band. The film was Akhtar's attempt to bring the northeast India into popular culture. Akhtar appeared as one of the nine judges in the beauty pageant, Femina Miss India (2002). He was the judge on the first season of the dance-reality show, Nach Baliye (2005). He hosted a TV show on NDTV Imagine, called Oye! It's Friday! in the same year. He has endorsed several brands as a part of his career, especially after the release of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. These include Hindustan Unilever's water purifier product titled Pureit, Chivas Regal, Britannia Nutri Choice Biscuits, IndusInd Bank, Dulux Paint, to name a fews. His endorsements are managed by Kwan Talent Management Agency Pvt Ltd. Men Against Rape and Discrimination or MARD is a social campaign launched by Akhtar. The idea came to the mind of Akhtar when in August 2012, Pallavi Purkayastha, a lawyer by profession, was sexually assaulted and then killed by her home watchman."

Forget about refusing, I jumped at the offer. Even if I had the chance to just go and observe him on the set I'd have done it. I love the man. I remember during those days each and every actor was copying Dilip Saab whether it was Dharmendra, Jeetendra or Manoj Kumar. I was much in-demand as Dilip Saab's sister. Every hero wanted the same. Every actor wanted me to play his sister.Sometimes the sister was the film's heroine. The official heroine would just sing her songs whereas I had all the dramatic scenes. I got my recognition and the awards. In a film called Paras I was Sanjeev Kumar's sister. But I had a lot more to do than Raakhee-di who played the heroine. I got my first award for it. Then I got my second award for Majboor, a film written by Salimbhai and Javedbhai where Bachchan Saab played my brother. It was so heartening. Why would I want to be heroine when I was getting the stronger parts as the sister?\" She acted for over 40 years, only taking a break during 1983 and 1990, when she settled in Bangalore. During the 1990s, Jalal had a part in many major hits in India, among them Raja Hindustani, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Dil To Pagal Hai, Kaho Naa...

Known for his dancing skills, Govinda has received twelve Filmfare Award nominations, a Filmfare Special Award, a Filmfare Award for Best Comedian, and four Zee Cine Awards. The actor was a member of the Parliament of India from 2004 to 2009.Govinda's first film was 1986's Ilzaam, and he has appeared in over 165 Hindi films. In June 1999, He was voted the tenth-greatest star of stage or screen in a BBC News Online poll. During the 1980s, Govinda's films spanned genres and included family, drama, action, and romance. He started out as an action hero in the 80's and reinvented himself as a comedy hero in 90's. At one time, Amitabh co-starred with him on his comeback to rejuvenate his market when his comeback films failed miserably. He was recognised the following decade as a comic actor after playing a mischievous young NCC cadet in the 1992 romance Shola Aur Shabnam, with Divya Bharti. Govinda had lead roles in several commercially successful comedy films, including Aankhen (1993), Raja Babu (1994), Coolie No. 1 (1995), Hero No. 1 (1997) and Haseena Maan Jaayegi (1999).

The show received the highest TRP of any reality-show opening episode. Govinda (a member of the Indian National Congress) was elected the seventh member of parliament for the Mumbai North constituency of Maharashtra, India in the 14th Lok Sabha elections in 2004, defeating Ram Naik of the Bharatiya Janata Party.   Govinda was born on 21 December 1963 to former actor Arun Kumar Ahuja and singer-actress Nirmala Devi into a family with Punjabi and Sindhi roots. Arun is best known for Mehboob Khan's Aurat (1940). He produced one unsuccessful film, and became ill shortly afterwards. The family, living in a bungalow on Mumbai's Carter Road, moved to Virar\u2014a northern Mumbai suburb\u2014where Govinda was born. The youngest of six children, he was given the pet name \"Chi Chi\", meaning \"little finger\" in Punjabi, the language spoken at home. After Govinda received a Bachelor of Commerce degree, his father suggested a career in film. Around this time, Govinda saw the film Disco Dancer; afterwards, he practised for hours and circulated a promotional VHS cassette. He was offered jobs in a fertiliser commercial and an Allwyn ad. His first lead role was in Tan-Badan, directed by his uncle Anand. Govinda began shooting for his next film, Love 86, in June 1985. Govinda's first released film was Ilzaam (1986), the fifth-biggest hit of the year. \"Street Dancer\", in which he breakdanced, established him as a dancing star. Govinda then appeared in a series of films with mixed success; most were action films, romances or family dramas. Often paired with Neelam Kothari, they appeared in Love 86 (1986), Khudgarz (1987) and Hatya (1988). Dariya Dil (1988), Jeete Hain Shaan Se (1988) were successful family dramas, and successful action films included Marte Dam Tak (1987) and Jung Baaz (1989).

Dhawan and other directors cast him with actresses such as Karishma Kapoor, Juhi Chawla and Raveena Tandon during the decade. Govinda's career had a setback during the early 2000s after a series of commercially unsuccessful films. His hits included Kunwara, Hadh Kar Di Aapne, Jodi No.1, Kyo Kii... Main Jhuth Nahin Bolta and Ek Aur Ek Gyarah. Although the actor was nominated for Filmfare Awards for Best Performance in a Comic Role for Kunwara, Jodi No.1, Kyo Kii... Main Jhuth Nahin Bolta and Akhiyon Se Goli Maare, since 2002 most of his films have been unsuccessful at the box office. He played a villain for the first time in his career in Shikari (2000). Although the movie was not a commercial success, Govinda's convincing portrayal of a sociopathic murderer was critically acclaimed. He turned down roles in Taal, Gadar: Ek Prem Katha and Devdas, all of which were successful. Govinda then joined the Indian National Congress. He won a seat in Parliament from Mumbai North by defeating five-time MP Ram Naik, a former Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, by over 50,000 votes in the 2004 general election. The actor took a break from films from 2003 to 2005. He had no new film releases in 2004 and 2005, although some of his completed films (such as 2005's Khullam Khulla Pyaar Karen and Ssukh\u2014produced by Govinda and directed by his brother, Kirti Kumar\u2014and 2006's Sandwich) were box-office failures. Govinda made a comeback to films in late 2006 with the hit comedy Bhagam Bhag (directed by Priyadarshan), in which he appeared with Akshay Kumar and Lara Dutta. It was Govinda and Kumar's first film together. His first release of 2007 was director Nikhil Advani's big-budget drama, Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love. The all-star cast also included Shannon Esra, Salman Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaye Khanna, Ayesha Takia, John Abraham, Vidya Balan, Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. Govinda played Raju, a taxi driver who helps the Caucasian Stephanie (Shannon Esra) who is frantically trying to find her lover; Raju eventually falls in love with her.

His second release that year was a comedy directed by David Dhawan, Partner co-starring Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif and Lara Dutta. The film grossed \u20b9300 million in India during its opening week, the second-highest domestic opening-week gross for an Indian film at that time.

This was followed by a T K Rajeev Kumar-directed comedy, Chal Chala Chal. Govinda's performance was praised, and the film was successful. That year Salman Khan invited Dhawan and Govinda on his show, 10 Ka Dum, to celebrate the success of Partner.

He also appeared in Rajnish Thakur's comedy, Loot, and voiced Bajrangi the monkey for Nikhil Advani's animated Delhi Safari. In 2013 Govinda co-starred with Priyanka Chopra in K. C. Bokadia's box-office failure, Deewana Main Deewana, which had been made about ten years earlier.

In 2004, Govinda joined the Congress Party party and was elected to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Indian parliament) from Mumbai by 50,000 votes over the five-term incumbent. During the elections, he said his agenda would be prawaas (transportation), swasthya (health) and gyaan (education). In the field of transportation, he claimed 80% credit for the quadrupling of the Borivali-Virar section of the Western Railway zone, which was certainly a great help to suburban commuters of his constituency. According to official sources, he made some efforts in the fields of health and education also. The Thane district collector said in an interview that Govinda had committed money from his \"local area development fund\" (allocated to each MP by the government) to construct anganwadis and solve drinking-water problems in Vasai and Virar but administrative approval was delayed. Govinda's filmstar status could explain his inaccessibility to his constituents but not his absence from parliament. During his tenure as the Member of Parliament, Govinda was usually absent when the Lok Sabha was in session and he was severely criticised for inactivity. At the same time, he continued his film career while he was serving as an MP. Indeed, his career witnessed a comeback of sorts in 2007, after the release of Partner (co-starring Salman Khan, who had been instrumental in getting him the role). He was pilloried in the press for the combination of continuing to act in films while being generally absent from parliament, and inaccessible to his constituents. On 20 January 2008, Govinda decided to leave politics and concentrate on his Bollywood acting career. Govinda's father, Arun Ahuja, was an actor during the 1940s; his mother, Nirmala Ahuja, was an actress and singer. His brother, Kirti Kumar, is an actor, producer and director. His sister, Kaamini Khanna, is a writer, music director and singer. Govinda's maternal uncle, Anand Singh (assistant to director Hrishikesh Mukherjee), introduced him in Tan-Badan. Singh's sister-in-law Sunita fell in love with Govinda at this time, and they were married on 11 March 1987. Their marriage was a secret for four years. They have two children: daughter Tina Ahuja and son Yashvardhan. Tina made her Bollywood debut in the 2015 Second Hand Husband. Govinda has six nephews and two nieces in the entertainment industry: actors Vinay Anand, Krishna Abhishek, Aryan, Arjun Singh, Ragini Khanna, Amit Khanna, Aarti Singh and director Janmendra Kumar Ahuja. Govinda's brother-in-law, Devendra Sharma, has appeared in several Hindi films (see Govinda family). Govinda was seriously injured on 5 January 1994 while travelling to a studio for the shooting of Khuddar. The actor's car collided with another car, and he sustained head injuries. Although he was bleeding profusely, Govinda did not cancel the shoot; after seeing a doctor, he worked until midnight. In January 2008, Govinda slapped a struggling actor, Santosh Rai, on the set of Money Hai Toh Honey Hai at Filmistan Studio in Mumbai. On 5 February 2009, Rai filed a complaint against Govinda, accusing him of assault and criminal intimidation, in the Borivali Magistrate Court. In 2013, the court ruled against Rai. In 2014, Rai took his case to the Supreme Court. He said that he had come to Mumbai to become an actor, and felt very humiliated when he was slapped by Govinda. According to Rai, he had contested the case for six years and had spent \u20b9500,000\u2013600,000 on attorney fees. Since the actor did not apologise, he was more determined to fight him in court. In December 2015, the Supreme Court asked Govinda to apologise to Rai for slapping him and settle the whole matter out of the court immediately in the span of two weeks. The actor said that he \"respects\" the court's decision, and will decide when he receives it in writing. In 1999 Govinda, his wife appeared on Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai, hosted by Bollywood actor Suresh Oberoi. Two years later he hosted a game show, Jeeto Chappar Phaad Ke (loosely translated as When the Heavens Open) on Sony TV. Although its first episode had good ratings, it ended after 13 episodes due to poor TRPs. In 2002 Govinda appeared on SAB TV's Movers & Shakers, a late-night talk show hosted by Shekhar Suman.

        "artist_name": "Guru_Dutt", 
        "biography": " Vasanth Kumar Shivashankar Padukone (9 July 1925 \u2013 10 October 1964), better known as Guru Dutt, was an Indian film director, producer and actor. He made 1950s and 1960s classics such as Pyaasa, Kaagaz Ke Phool , Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam and Chaudhvin Ka Chand. In particular, Pyaasa and Kaagaz Ke Phool are now included among the greatest films of all time, both by Time magazine's \"All-TIME\" 100 best movies  and by the Sight & Sound critics' and directors' poll, where Dutt himself is included among the greatest film directors of all time. He is sometimes referred to as \"India's Orson Welles\". In 2010, he was included among CNN's \"top 25 Asian actors of all time\". He is most famous for making lyrical and artistic films within the context of popular Hindi cinema of the 1950s, and expanding its commercial conventions, starting with his 1957 film, Pyaasa. Several of his later works have a cult following. His movies go full house when re-released; especially in Germany, France and Japan.   Guru Dutt was born on 9 July 1925, in Bangalore to Shivashanker Rao Padukone and Vasanthi Padukone in a Konkani Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmin family. He was originally named Vasanth Kumar Shivashankar Padukone but this was changed to Guru Dutt following a childhood accident, the belief being that it was an auspicious choice. His parents were originally settled in Karwar but relocated. Dutt spent his early childhood in Bhowanipore. He spoke fluent Bengali. Dutt wired home to say he had got the job of a telephone operator at a Lever Brothers factory in Calcutta. But soon he got disenchanted by the job and left it. He later joined his parents in Bombay in 1944. However, his uncle found him a job under a three-year contract with the Prabhat Film Company in Pune (then called Poona) in 1944. This once premier film producing centre had already seen the departure of its best talent, V. Shantaram, who had by then launched his own production company called Kala Mandir. It was at Prabhat Film Company that Dutt met two people who would remain his good friends for life - actors Rehman and Dev Anand. Dutt acted in a small role as Sri Krishna in Chand in 1944. In 1945, he acted as well as assisted director Vishram Bedekar in Lakhrani, and in 1946 he worked as an assistant director and choreographed dances for P. L. Santoshi\u2019s film, Hum Ek Hain. This contract ended in 1947, but Dutt's mother got him a job as a freelance assistant with Baburao Pai, the CEO of the Prabhat Film Company and Studio. However, after that, for almost ten months, he was unemployed and stayed with his family at Matunga in Bombay. During this time, Dutt developed a flair for writing in English, and wrote short stories for The Illustrated Weekly of India, a local weekly English magazine. While Dutt was hired by Prabhat Film Company as a choreographer, he was pressed into service as an actor, and even as an assistant director. After Prabhat failed in 1947, Dutt moved to Bombay, where he worked with two leading directors of the time, with Amiya Chakravarty in Girls' School, and with Gyan Mukherjee in the Bombay Talkies film Sangram. Then, Dev Anand offered him a job as a director in his new company, Navketan, after the first movie had flopped. Dutt's first film, Navketan's Baazi, was released in 1951 . It was a tribute to 1940s film noir genre of Hollywood with the morally ambiguous hero, the transgressing siren, and shadow lighting. Dev Anand and Dutt had reached an agreement that if Dutt were to turn filmmaker, he would hire Anand as his hero, and if Anand were to produce a film then he would use Dutt as its director. Anand subsequently used Dutt in his Baazi movie, while Dutt employed Anand in C.I.D.. After Dutt's death, Anand said that \"He was a young man he should not have made depressing pictures.\" Dutt and Anand would make two super-hit films together, Baazi, and Jaal. Creative differences between Dutt, and Chetan Anand (Anand's elder brother), who was also a director, made future collaborations difficult.[citation needed] Baazi was an immediate success. Dutt followed it with Jaal and Baaz. Neither film did well at the box office, but they brought together the Guru Dutt team that performed so brilliantly in subsequent films. He discovered, and mentored, Johnny Walker (comedian), V.K. Murthy (cinematography), and Abrar Alvi (writing and directing), among others. He is also credited for introducing Waheeda Rehman to the Hindi cinema. Baaz was notable in that Dutt both directed and starred, not having found a suitable actor for the principal character. Fortune smiled on Dutt's next film, the 1954 Aar Paar. This was followed by the 1955 hit, Mr. & Mrs. '55, then C.I.D., Sailaab, and in 1957, Pyaasa - the story of a poet, rejected by an uncaring world, who achieves success only after his apparent death. Dutt played the lead role in three of these five films. His 1959 Kaagaz Ke Phool was an intense disappointment. He had invested a great deal of love, money, and energy in this film, which was a self-absorbed tale of a famous director (played by Guru Dutt) who falls in love with an actress (played by Waheeda Rehman, Dutt's real-life love interest). Kaagaz Ke Phool failed at the box office and Dutt was devastated. All subsequent films from his studio were, thereafter, officially headed by other directors since Dutt felt that his name was anathema to box office. Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam, a critically and commercially successful film, was directed by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, writer Abrar Alvi, which won him the Filmfare Best Director's award. The film's star, Waheeda Rehman, denied rumours that the film was ghost-directed by Dutt himself. Dutt also influenced on his last box office smash hit Chaudhvin Ka Chand. In 1964 Dutt acted in his last film Sanjh Aur Savera directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee opposite Meena Kumari. Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi was the last film he was working on at the time of his death. He was replaced as the lead by Dharmendra and the film released in 1966 as his team's last production. On 10 October 1964, Dutt was found dead in his bed in his rented apartment at Pedder Road in Bombay. He is said to have been mixing alcohol and sleeping pills. His death may have been suicide, or just an accidental overdose. It would have been his third suicide attempt. Dutt's son, Arun Dutt, considered the death to be an accident. Dutt had scheduled appointments the next day with actress Mala Sinha for his movie Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi, and Raj Kapoor to discuss making colour films. According to him, \"my father had sleeping disorders and popped sleeping pills like any other person. That day he was drunk and had taken an overdose of pills, which culminated in his death. It was a lethal combination of excessive liquor and sleeping pills.\" At the time of his death, Dutt was involved in two other projects - Picnic starring actress Sadhana, and director K. Asif's epic, Love and God. Picnic remained incomplete and Love and God was released two decades later with Sanjeev Kumar replacing Dutt in the leading role. The extra-feature on the DVD of Kaagaz Ke Phool has a three-part Channel 4-produced documentary on the life and works of Dutt titled In Search of Guru Dutt. A Doordarshan documentary on Dutt aired on 10 October 2011. In 1953, Dutt married Geeta Dutt, a well-known playback singer. They had been engaged for three years and had to overcome a great deal of family opposition to marry. They had three children, Tarun, Arun, and Nina, who grew in the homes of Dutt\u2019s brother Atma Ram and Geeta Dutt\u2019s brother Mukul Roy after their parents died. Dutt had an unhappy marital life. According to his brother Atmaram, he was \"a strict disciplinarian as far as work was concerned, but totally undisciplined in his personal life\" (Kabir, 1997, p.\u00a0124). He smoked heavily, drank heavily, and kept odd hours. Dutt's relationship with actress Waheeda Rehman also worked against their marriage. At the time of his death, he had separated from Geeta and was living alone. Geeta Dutt died in 1972 at age 41, after excessive drinking which resulted in liver damage. According to an interview with Abrar Alvi, one of Dutt's close friends and his assistant director in films, Dutt did not \"open up\" to discuss his thoughts and problems, even though they were spending many hours together.[citation needed] Contrary to a general belief about the viability of his film projects, Dutt more or less produced commercially successful films. Over the years the commercial nature of his projects saw a trade-off with his creative aspirations. Movies like C.I.D., Baazi, Pyaasa, Kaagaz Ke Phool, Chaudhvin Ka Chand and Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam were the first of their kind in Hindi cinema. The only movie produced by Dutt that was considered a box-office disaster was Kaagaz Ke Phool, which is now a cult classic. He lost over Rs.1.7\u00a0million producing that film, a large amount by the standards of that time, which was more than recovered by his next project, Chaudhvin Ka Chand. He never lost faith in his team or in the distributors of his films. Once a project was over, he would begin anew - with little concern about the commercial success of the previous project. He was part of an exclusive school of Indian film directors, including the likes of Raj Kapoor, Mehboob Khan and Bimal Roy, who were able to achieve a healthy blend of artistic and commercial success between the mid-1950s and mid-1960s. Pyaasa was rated as one of the best 100 films of all time by Time magazine. In the 2002 Sight & Sound critics' and directors' poll, two of his films, Pyaasa and Kaagaz Ke Phool, were among the top 160 greatest films of all time. The same 2002 Sight & Sound poll ranked Dutt at #73 in its list of all-time greatest directors, thus making him the eighth highest-ranking Asian filmmaker in the poll. A postage stamp, bearing his face, was released by India Post to honour him on 11 October 2004. "

        "biography": " Helen Ann Richardson (born 21 November 1938), popularly known as only Helen, is a Burma-born Indian film actress and dancer, working in Hindi films. She has appeared in over 700 films, and is often cited as the most popular nautch dancer of her time. She was the inspiration for four films and a book. She is the second wife of veteran writer-producer Salim Khan.   Helen Ann Richardson was born on 21 November 1938 in Rangoon, Burma to an Anglo-Indian father and Burmese mother. Her father's name was George Desmier. She has a brother named Roger and a sister name Jennifer. Their father died during World War II. The family then trekked to Mumbai in 1943 in order to escape from the Japanese occupation of Burma. Helen told Filmfare during an interview in 1964: ...we trekked alternately through wilderness and hundreds of villages, surviving on the generosity of people, for we were penniless, with no food and few clothes. Occasionally, we met British soldiers who provided us with transport, found us refuge and treated our blistered feet and bruised bodies and fed us. By the time we reached Dibrugarh in Assam, our group had been reduced to half. Some had fallen ill and been left behind, some had died of starvation and disease. My mother miscarried along the way. The survivors were admitted to the Dibrugarh hospital for treatment. Mother and I had been virtually reduced to skeletons and my brother's condition was critical. We spent two months in hospital. When we recovered, we moved to Calcutta\". She quit her schooling to support her family because her mother's salary as a nurse was not enough to feed a family of four. In a documentary called Queen of the Nautch girls, Helen said she was 19 years old in 1957 when she got her first big break in Howrah Bridge. Helen was introduced to Bollywood when a family friend, an actress known as Cukoo, helped her find jobs as a chorus dancer in the films Shabistan and Awara (1951). She was soon working regularly and was featured as a solo dancer in films such as Alif Laila (1954) and Hoor-e-Arab (1955). She got her break in 1958, aged 19, when she performed the song \"Mera Naam Chin Chin Chu\" in Shakti Samanta's film, Howrah Bridge, which was sung by Geeta Dutt. After that, offers started pouring in throughout the 1960s and 1970s. During her initial career, Geeta Dutt sang many songs for her. The Bollywood playback singer Asha Bhosle also frequently sang for Helen, particularly during the 1960s and the early 1970s. She was nominated for the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award in 1965 for her role in Gumnaam. She played dramatic roles such as the rape victim in Shakti Samanta's Pagla Kahin Ka (1970). Writer Salim Khan helped her get roles in some of the films he was co-scripting with Javed Akhtar: Immaan Dharam, Don, Dostana, and Sholay. This was followed by a role in Mahesh Bhatt's film Lahu Ke Do Rang (1979), for which she won a Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award. In 1999 Helen was given India's Filmfare lifetime achievement award. Helen officially retired from movies in 1983, but she has since then appeared in a few guest roles such as Khamoshi: The Musical (1996) and Mohabbatein (2000). She also made a special appearance as the mother of real-life step-son Salman Khan's character in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam.. She also appeared in Humko Deewana Kar Gaye in 2006. Helen was selected for the Padma Shri awards of 2009 along with Aishwarya Rai and Akshay Kumar. She performed onstage in London, Paris, and Hong Kong. In 1973, Helen, Queen of the Nautch Girls, a 30-minute documentary film from Merchant Ivory Films, was released. Anthony Korner directed and narrated the film. A book about Helen was published by Jerry Pinto in 2006, titled The Life and Times of an H-Bomb, which went on to win the National Film Award for Best Book on Cinema in 2007. Helen appeared as a Judge in the semi finals and finals of India's 2009 Dancing Queen television series. In 1981, Helen married Salim Khan, a prominent Bollywood screenplay writer. Khan was already married and the father of four children; Helen joined the Khan family and had a large role (along with Khan and his first wife Sushila) in keeping the family united. All of Helen's step-children have bonded closely with her, and Helen is almost invariably accompanied in public appearances by her co-wife, Sushila (alias Salma Khan).[citation needed] In the late 1980s, Helen and Khan adopted a baby girl, Arpita. Arpita Khan was the daughter of a homeless woman who happened to die on the Mumbai footpath owing to some accident. Khan came across this baby, saw her weeping, and brought her home to take care of her.[unreliable source?] Arpita grew up with her three parents, three older brothers and elder sister in the Khan household. She did her schooling in Mumbai, then studied at the London School of Fashion, and came back to Mumbai to work in an interior design firm.[relevant? \u2013 discuss] On 18 November 2014, Arpita married Aayush Sharma, a Delhi-based businessman who is the son of Anil Sharma, a minister in the government of Himachal Pradesh and the grandson of Sukh Ram, a former union cabinet minister; both the politicians belong to the Indian National Congress party. The date was chosen to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the wedding of Salim Khan and his first wife, Sushila. The wedding was held on a grand scale at the Falaknuma Palace hotel in Hyderabad.[relevant? \u2013 discuss] On 30 March 2016, Arpita and Aayush Sharma were blessed with a baby boy, who they named Ahil Sharma; he is Helen's sixth grandchild.[relevant? \u2013 discuss]"

        "biography": " Hrithik Roshan (English pronunciation: /\u02c8r\u026at\u026ak \u02c8r\u0252\u0283\u0259n/, born 10 January 1974) is an Indian actor who appears in Bollywood films. The son of the filmmaker Rakesh Roshan, he has portrayed a variety of characters and is known for his dancing ability. He is one of the highest-paid actors in India and has won many awards, including six Filmfares. Roshan has frequently collaborated with his father. He made brief appearances as a child actor in several films throughout the 1980s, and later worked as an assistant director on four of his father's films. His first leading role was in the box-office success Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000), for which he received several awards. Performances in the 2000 terrorism drama Fiza and the 2001 ensemble melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... consolidated his reputation but were followed by several poorly received films. The 2003 science fiction film Koi... Mil Gaya, for which Roshan won two Filmfare Awards (Best Actor and Best Actor \u2013 Critics), was a turning point in his career; he also appeared in its highly successful sequels: Krrish (2006) and Krrish 3 (2013). He earned widespread praise for his portrayal of a thief in the 2006 adventure film Dhoom 2, Mughal emperor Akbar in the 2008 historical romance Jodhaa Akbar and a quadriplegic in the 2010 drama Guzaarish. Further success came with the 2011 drama Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, the 2012 revenge film Agneepath and the 2014 action comedy Bang Bang!. Roshan has also performed on stage and debuted on television with Just Dance (2011). As a judge on the latter, he became the highest-paid film star on Indian television. He is involved with a number of humanitarian causes, endorses several brands and products and has launched his own clothing line. Roshan was married for fourteen years to Sussanne Khan, with whom he has two children. He is among the most popular Indian celebrities.   Roshan was born on 10 January 1974 in Mumbai to a Punjabi family prominent in Bollywood. His father, film director Rakesh Roshan, is the son of music director Roshanlal Nagrath; his mother, Pinky, is the daughter of producer and director J. Om Prakash. Roshan has an older sister, Sunaina, and was educated at the Bombay Scottish School. Although Roshan practices Hinduism, he says that \"I'm not religious. I don't visit temples. But I hope there is a superpower.\" Roshan felt isolated as a child; he was born with an extra thumb on his right hand which led some of his peers to avoid him. He has stammered since the age of six; this caused him problems at school, and he feigned injury and illness to avoid oral tests. He was helped by daily speech therapy. Roshan's grandfather, Prakash first brought him on-screen at the age of six in the film Aasha (1980); he danced in a song enacted by Jeetendra, for which Prakash paid him \u20b9100 (US$1.50). Roshan made uncredited appearances in various family film projects, including his father's production Aap Ke Deewane (1980). In Prakash's Aas Paas (1981), he appeared in the song \"Shehar Main Charchi Hai\". The actor's only speaking role during this period came when he was 12; he was seen as Govinda, the title character's adopted son, in Prakash's Bhagwaan Dada (1986). Roshan decided that he wanted to be a full-time actor, but his father insisted that he focus on his studies. In his early 20s, he was diagnosed with scoliosis that would not allow him to dance or perform stunts. Initially devastated, he eventually decided to become an actor anyway. Around a year after the diagnosis, he took a chance by jogging on a beach when he was caught in a downpour. There was no pain, and becoming more confident, he was able to increase his pace with no adverse effects. Roshan sees this day as \"the turning point of [his] life\". Roshan attended Sydenham College, where he took part in dance and music festivals while studying, graduating in commerce. Roshan assisted his father on four films\u2014Khudgarz (1987), King Uncle (1993), Karan Arjun (1995) and Koyla (1997)\u2014while also sweeping the floor and making tea for the crew. After pack-up, Roshan would enact Shah Rukh Khan's scenes from Koyla and film himself to make a judgement about his performance as an actor. While he assisted his father, he studied acting under Kishore Namit Kapoor. Roshan was originally scheduled to make his screen debut as a lead actor opposite Preity Zinta in the cancelled film Shekhar Kapur's Tara Rum Pum Pum. Instead, he starred in his father's romantic drama Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000) opposite another debutante, Ameesha Patel. Roshan played dual roles: Rohit, an aspiring singer brutally killed after witnessing a murder, and Raj, an NRI who falls in love with Patel's character. To prepare, he trained with the actor Salman Khan to bulk up physically, worked to improve his diction and took lessons in acting, singing, dancing, fencing and riding. With global revenues of \u20b9620 million (US$9.6\u00a0million), Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai became the highest-grossing Indian film of 2000. His performance was acclaimed by critics; Suggu Kanchana on Rediff.com wrote, \"[Roshan] is good. The ease and style with which he dances, emotes, fights, makes one forget this is his debut film [...] He seems to be the most promising among the recent lot of star sons we have been subjected to.\" For the role, Roshan received Best Male Debut and Best Actor Awards at the annual Filmfare Awards, IIFA Awards, and Zee Cine Awards. He became the first actor to win both Filmfare Best Debut and Best Actor awards the same year. The success of the film established Roshan as a prominent actor in Bollywood. The actor found life hard after his overnight success, particularly the demands on his time. In his second release, Khalid Mohammed's crime drama Fiza, Roshan played Amaan, an innocent Muslim boy who becomes a terrorist after the 1992\u201393 Bombay riots. Roshan appeared in the film to expand his horizons as an actor. Co-starring Karisma Kapoor and Jaya Bachchan, Fiza was moderately successful at the box office, and Roshan's performance earned him a second nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare ceremony. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama praised him as the production's prime asset, commending his \"body language, his diction, his expressions, [and] his overall persona\". Roshan next appeared in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's action drama Mission Kashmir (2000) alongside Sanjay Dutt, Preity Zinta, and Jackie Shroff. Set in the valley of Kashmir during the Indo-Pakistani conflicts, the film addressed the topics of terrorism and crime, and was a financial success. Roshan was drawn to his complex role of a young man traumatised by the discovery that his adoptive father had been responsible for the death of his entire birth family. In Adarsh's opinion, Roshan \"brightens up the screen with his magnetic presence. His body language, coupled with his expressions, is sure to win him plaudits.\" In 2001, Roshan appeared in two films, the first of which was Subhash Ghai's Yaadein, a romantic drama which paired him with Kareena Kapoor and reunited him with Shroff. Although highly anticipated, Yaadein was reviled by critics; in The Hindu, Ziya Us Salam criticised the director for relying on Roshan's commercial appeal. Roshan next had a supporting role in Karan Johar's ensemble melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... alongside Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Kareena Kapoor. He was cast as Rohan Raichand\u2014the younger son of Bachchan's character who plots to reunite him with his adopted son (played by Khan)\u2014after Johar had watched a rough cut of Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... finished as India's second highest-grossing film of the year, and among the most successful Bollywood films in the overseas market, earning over \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide. Writing for Rediff.com, Anjum N described Roshan as \"the surprise scene-stealer\", praising him for holding his own against the established actors. Roshan received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. Roshan enjoyed little success in 2002. His first release, Vikram Bhatt's romance Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage, reunited him with Ameesha Patel but failed at the box office, as did Arjun Sablok's romance Na Tum Jaano Na Hum (2002). Roshan's final role that year was in a Yash Raj Films production, the high-profile Mujhse Dosti Karoge! co-starring Rani Mukerji and Kareena Kapoor. The romantic drama was heavily promoted before its release and proved a success internationally, but failed to return a profit in India. In another commercial failure, Sooraj R. Barjatya's Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon, Roshan was cast alongside Kareena Kapoor for the fourth time, and Abhishek Bachchan. The press labeled Roshan a \"one-trick pony\" and suggested that the failure of these films would end his career. Roshan's career began to revive with a starring role in Koi... Mil Gaya (2003). The film, directed and produced by his father, centers on his character Rohit Mehra, a developmentally disabled young man, who comes in contact with an extraterrestrial being\u2014a role that required him to lose nearly 8 kilograms (18\u00a0lb). Roshan recalls the experience of starring in the film fondly: \"I could live my childhood [again]. I could eat as many chocolates as I wanted. I became a baby and everybody was so caring towards me.\" In the book Film Sequels, Carolyn Jess-Cooke drew similarities between the character and Forrest Gump, portrayed by Tom Hanks in the titular film, but this idea was dismissed by Roshan. Film critics were polarised on their view of the film\u2014some of them negatively compared its storyline to the 1982 Hollywood release E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\u2014but were unanimous in their praise for Roshan. In a 2010 retrospective of the Top 80 Iconic Performances of Bollywood, Filmfare noted \"how flesh and blood Hrithik's act is. Simply because he believes he is the part. Watch him laugh, cry or bond with his remote controlled alien friend and note his nuanced turn.\" A Rediff.com critic agreed that Roshan was \"the turbojet that propels the film to the realm of the extraordinary\". Koi... Mil Gaya was the most popular Bollywood film of the year, earning \u20b9800 million (US$12\u00a0million), and Roshan won both Filmfare Awards for Best Actor and Best Actor (Critics). \"I am glad I have the intelligence to understand what is happening to me. If I allow myself to get affected by all this hype, I'll stunt my growth as an actor and be damned for life. I know that I still have a long way to go before I can even aspire to equal the achievements of any of the superstars. I know I am good at my job, and I am sure I will be damn good one day but right now, I also know how bad I can be.\" The following year, Roshan collaborated with Amitabh Bachchan and Preity Zinta on Farhan Akhtar's Lakshya (2004), a fictionalised coming-of-age story set against events from the 1999 Kargil War. He also featured in the item number \"Main Aisa Kyun Hoon\" (choreographed by Prabhu Deva) which proved popular with audiences. The film was a critical success, and earned Roshan Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare and Zee Cine ceremony. Manish Gajjar of the BBC praised Roshan's versatility and his transformation from a carefree youth to a determined and courageous soldier. Roshan was not seen on screen again until 2006, with three new releases, including a cameo at the end of the year in the romance I See You. He co-starred with Naseeruddin Shah and Priyanka Chopra in his father's superhero production Krrish. A follow-up to his family's production Koi... Mil Gaya, it saw him play dual roles\u2014the title superhero and his character from the original film. Before production, Roshan traveled to China to train with Tony Ching for the cable work that would be needed to make his character fly. He sustained several injuries during production. For example, he tore the hamstring in his right leg and broke his thumb and toe. Krrish was a box office success and became the second-highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2006 with a worldwide revenue of \u20b91.17 billion (US$18\u00a0million). It garnered him Best Actor awards at the 2007 Screen and the International Indian Film Academy Awards. Ronnie Scheib of Variety considered Roshan a prime asset of the film, noting that he \"pulls off the pic's wilder absurdities with considerable panache\". For his role as an enigmatic master thief in Dhoom 2 (2006)\u2014an action sequel co-starring Aishwarya Rai, Bipasha Basu and Abhishek Bachchan\u2014Roshan won his third Filmfare Award for Best Actor. The film critic Rajeev Masand called him \"the heart, the soul, and the spirit of the film\", and praised his stunts, concluding that he \"holds the film together and even manages to take your attention away from its many flaws\". Bored by playing the \"good guy\", Roshan was excited to play a villain for the first time. At the request of the film's producer Aditya Chopra, Roshan lost 12 pounds (5.4\u00a0kg) for the role, and learned skateboarding, snow boarding, rollerblading and sand surfing. With earnings of \u20b91.5 billion (US$23\u00a0million), Dhoom 2 became the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, a distinction it held for two years. In the 2007 melodrama Om Shanti Om, he made a cameo alongside several Bollywood stars. In 2008, Roshan was cast in Ashutosh Gowariker's Jodhaa Akbar, a partly fictionalised account of a marriage of convenience between the Mughal emperor Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar (played by Roshan) and the Rajput princess Jodha Bai (played by Rai). Gowariker believed Roshan possessed the regal bearing and physique required to play the role of a king. For the role, Roshan learned sword-fighting and horse-riding, and also took Urdu lessons. Jodhaa Akbar was an economic success and earned \u20b91.12 billion (US$17\u00a0million) worldwide. Roshan's performance earned him his fourth Filmfare Best Actor Award as well as his first international award \u2013\"Best Actor\" at the Golden Minbar International Film Festival in Kazan, Russia. Critics were generally appreciative of Roshan's performance. Raja Sen of Rediff.com thought that Roshan \"proves a very good Akbar. There are times when his inflection seems too modern, but the actor gives the performance his all, slipping into the skin of the character and staying there.\" Roshan ended 2008 with an appearance in the popular item number \"Krazzy 4\" from the film of same name. Following a small role in Zoya Akhtar's Luck by Chance in 2009, Roshan starred in and recorded \"Kites in the Sky\" for the multi-national romantic thriller Kites (2010). In the film, produced by his father, he played a man running a green card scam in Las Vegas in which he has married 11 different women in exchange for money. Kites opened on a record-breaking 3000 screens, and became the first Bollywood film to break into the North American top 10. However, the film eventually underperformed at India's box office and received negative reviews from critics. The website Box Office India attributed this failure to its multilingual dialogues. In a review for Rediff.com, Matthew Schneeberger thought that Roshan \"overacts. A lot. In Kites, he nails a few scenes, but bungles many more, particularly the film's catastrophically bad ending\". Roshan then collaborated with director Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the drama Guzaarish (2010) in which he had the role of Ethan Mascarenhas, a former magician suffering from quadriplegia, who after years of struggle, files an appeal for euthanasia. Roshan had reservations about the role but agreed to the project after reading the film's story. To understand his role better, he interacted with paraplegic patients. In his own words, \"I used to spend six hours with the patients, initially once a week and then once a month. I used to go to understand what they go through, what they think, what their needs are. They have taught me a lot of things.\" He also trained with a Ukrainian magician to perform the film's magic stunts, and put on weight to look the part. The film failed at the box office, though it and Roshan's performance were positively received by critics. A writer for Zee News praised the chemistry between Roshan and Rai, adding that they \"break the Bollywood mould of stereotypes\". Roshan received the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor (Critics) and nominations for Filmfare, IIFA and Zee Cine Award for Best Actor. In 2011, Roshan appeared in Zoya Akhtar's ensemble comedy-drama Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara alongside Abhay Deol and Farhan Akhtar as three friends who embark on a bachelor trip where they overcome their insecurities. Zoya cast Roshan in the role of an uptight workaholic as she considers him her favourite actor. For the film's soundtrack, Roshan recorded the song \"Se\u00f1orita\" with his co-stars and Maria del Mar Fern\u00e1ndez. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara was released to positive reviews and Roshan's performance was praised. Rajeev Masand wrote, \"Hrithik Roshan once again brings real depth to his character with a spectacular performance. He's shy and restrained, then lets go with such fantastic intensity that you make the inward journey with his character.\" The film grossed \u20b91.53 billion (US$24\u00a0million) worldwide and became Roshan's first commercial success in three years. He was nominated for another Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance. Later that year, he made a special appearance in Farhan's Don 2. Roshan's only screen appearance in 2012 was in Karan Malhotra's Agneepath, a retelling of the 1990 film of the same name. Cast alongside Rishi Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt and Priyanka Chopra, Roshan reinterpreted the character Vijay Deenanath Chauhan (originally played by Amitabh Bachchan), a common man who seeks revenge against an unscrupulous man for framing and murdering his father. Roshan was initially skeptical of taking up a role earlier played by Bachchan, and thought hard before accepting. He did not watch the original film for inspiration as he found his role to be completely different. In one of several accidents to happen during production, Roshan suffered a painful back injury. He deemed Agneepath \"the hardest [project] I've ever worked in my life\" owing to the exhaustion he felt while filming. The film broke Bollywood's highest opening-day earnings record, and had a worldwide gross of \u20b91.93 billion (US$30\u00a0million). A Firstpost reviewer thought Roshan \"breathes fire and soul into Agneepath\". The actor was rewarded with another Filmfare nomination and a third consecutive Stardust Award for Best Actor in a Drama, having won previously for Guzaarish and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. Roshan appeared in the third instalment of the Krrish film series\u2014Krrish 3 (2013) which also starred Priyanka Chopra, Vivek Oberoi and Kangana Ranaut. During production, Roshan was injured when he fell down. Critics thought that the film was entertaining but lacking in originality, though Roshan's performance garnered praise. The editor Komal Nahta lauded Roshan for successfully playing three different characters in the film, and the actor received his eleventh Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. Krrish 3 grossed \u20b92.91 billion (US$45\u00a0million) worldwide, becoming one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. Roshan received a fourth consecutive Filmfare nomination for his performance in the 2014 action comedy Bang Bang!, a remake of the 2010 Hollywood release Knight and Day and one of the most expensive Bollywood films. Playing the role of an eccentric secret agent who plots to track down a terrorist, Roshan became the first actor to perform a flyboarding stunt in film. While filming in Thailand, Roshan suffered a head injury from a stunt accident and underwent brain surgery to relieve a chronic subdural hematoma. The critic Mohar Basu noted that Roshan was \"pitch perfect\" and \"breez[ed] through his part brilliantly\". The film was a commercial success, earning \u20b93.4 billion (US$53\u00a0million) in global ticket sales. For playing the role of a farmer in 2016 BC who travels to Mohenjo-daro in Ashutosh Gowariker's Mohenjo Daro (2016), Roshan was paid \u20b9500 million (US$7.7\u00a0million), a record-breaking remuneration for an Indian actor. He underwent a three-month training to achieve the \"lithe\" and \"agile\" physique required for his role. Despite being a highly anticipated release, it failed commercially, and critics were generally unenthusiastic. Dismissing the film as an \"unintentional comedy\", Anupama Chopra wrote that Roshan \"pours his soul into every scene. But the burden of carrying this leaden, cartoon-like narrative proves too much even for his Herculean shoulders\". Roshan was next seen alongside Yami Gautam in Sanjay Gupta's Kaabil (2017), a romantic thriller about a blind man who avenges the rape of his blind wife. To ensure authenticity in his portrayal, Roshan locked himself in a room for four days and avoided contact with people. Reviews for the film were generally positive with particular praise for Roshan's performance. Meena Iyer of The Times of India found his performance to be his best to date, and Shubhra Gupta on The Indian Express considered him \"the only bright spot in this dispirited mess of a movie\". The film became a commercial success, accumulating \u20b91.96 billion (US$30\u00a0million) worldwide. Roshan has performed on stage, appeared on television, and launched a clothing line. His first tour (Heartthrobs: Live in Concert (2002) with Kareena Kapoor, Karisma Kapoor, Arjun Rampal and Aftab Shivdasani) was successful in the United States and Canada. At the end of that year, he danced on stage with Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt, Kareena Kapoor, Rani Mukerji and Shah Rukh Khan at Kings Park Stadium in Durban, South Africa in the show Now or Never. In 2011, Roshan served as a judge alongside Farah Khan and Vaibhavi Merchant for the dance competition reality show, Just Dance. He became the highest-paid film star on Indian television after he was paid \u20b920 million (US$310,000) per episode. The show ran from June to October 2011. In November 2013, Roshan launched his clothing line, the casual wear brand HRx. Roshan is vocal about his childhood stammer. He actively supports the Dilkhush Special School for mentally challenged children in Mumbai. In 2008, he donated \u20b92 million (US$31,000) to the Nanavati Hospital for the treatment of stammering children. Roshan set up a charity foundation in 2009 that aims to work for handicapped people. He donates roughly \u20b9700,000 (US$11,000) for charity every month, and believes that people should publicise their philanthropic work to set an example for others. In 2013, he took part in a festivity at Ghatkopar, whose proceeds went to an NGO supporting tribal girls suffering from malnutrition and starvation. Also that year, he donated \u20b92.5 million (US$39,000) to help the victims of the 2013 North India floods. Alongside other Bollywood stars, Roshan played a football match for charity organised by Aamir Khan's daughter, Ira, in 2014. The following year, he appeared with Sonam Kapoor in the music video for \"Dheere Dheere\", whose profits were donated to charity. Later that year, Roshan became the Indian brand ambassador for UNICEF and the Global Goals campaign's World's Largest Lesson that aims to educate children in over 100 countries about the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2016, Roshan and other Bollywood actors made donations for building homes for families affected by the 2015 South Indian floods. In October 2000, Roshan married Sussanne Khan in a private ceremony in Bangalore. Despite their religious difference\u2014Roshan is a Hindu and Khan is a Muslim\u2014Roshan says that he equally valued her beliefs. The couple has two sons, Hrehaan (born in 2006) and Hridhaan (born in 2008). They separated in December 2013 and their divorce was finalised in November 2014. Though Roshan maintained that they parted amicably, the media reported that the split was due to infidelity on his part, linking him with several actresses, most notably his Krrish 3 co-star Kangana Ranaut. Roshan denied having an affair with the actress, and filed a lawsuit against her in 2016 accusing her of cyber stalking and harassment. Denying the charges, Ranaut filed a counter-charge against Roshan, claiming that his lawsuit was an attempt to cover-up their affair for the benefit of his divorce proceedings. Owing to a lack of evidence, the Mumbai Police closed the case later that year. Roshan considered quitting the film industry after two assailants fired bullets at his father in 2000. Later that December, he was involved in a controversy when Nepalese newspapers accused him of stating in a Star Plus interview that he hated Nepal and its people. This led to protests in the country, a ban on screening of his films, and four people's deaths after street violence. Nepalese people threatened to \"bury [him] alive\" if he ever visited the country. Star Plus, for its part, stated that Roshan \"did not touch upon Nepal\". The violence calmed down after Roshan wrote a two-page rejoinder in which he denied having made any claim against the country and actress Manisha Koirala helped distribute it to newspapers and a local television station. As the son of the filmmaker Rakesh, Roshan faced the media spotlight from a young age. Discussing nepotism in Bollywood, Shama Rana views him as one of several actors who managed film careers with the help of family relations in the industry. On the other hand, Roshan is acknowledged in the media as one of the most talented Indian actors of his generation, for his devotion to his work and for his ability to commit heavily to each role. He insists on learning any necessary skills and performing stunts himself, and is particularly known for his professionalism. The director Ashutosh Gowariker praised Roshan when he continued filming Mohenjo Daro despite several injuries and being in a troubled state of mind. Zoya Akhtar, who considers Roshan her favourite actor, and directed him in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, remarks on his ability to display a range of emotions on screen. Roshan intentionally takes on diverse parts in an attempt to not be typecast. He looks at the scripts as a platform to inspire with the strength and courage of his characters and to make his audiences smile. Roshan was noted by critics for his versatility in portraying a variety of characters in Koi... Mil Gaya (2003), Lakshya (2004), Jodhaa Akbar (2008), and Guzaarish (2010). Box Office India ranked him first on its top actors listing in 2000 and later included him in 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. Roshan topped Rediff.com's list of best Bollywood actors in 2003, and was ranked fourth in 2006. Filmfare magazine included two of his performances\u2014from Koi... Mil Gaya and Lakshya\u2014on its 2010 list of 80 Iconic Performances. In March 2011, Roshan placed fourth on Rediff.com's list of Top 10 Actors of 2000\u20132010. Roshan's dancing ability has also drawn praise from the media, an opinion he disagrees with. The Los Angeles Times finds him to be \"a sensational dancer\" who \"has the dashing, chiseled looks of a silent movie matinee idol\". Some critics also believe that he is only able to dance and act in his father's films. His inclination towards \"glamourous, albeit empty parts\", which conform to character stereotypes, has been criticised. Roshan is among Bollywood's highest-paid actors. Discussing his success ratio at the box office in a 2014 article, Daily News and Analysis credited him as \"the most bankable star\" in Bollywood. One of the most high-profile Indian celebrities, he was named the second most powerful Indian film star by Forbes in 2001. He ranked fourth in Filmfare Power List in 2007. In a 2009 poll conducted by Daily News and Analysis Roshan was voted one of India's most popular icons. At the 2009 FICCI-IIFA Awards, Roshan was one of the ten recipients of the most powerful Bollywood entertainers of the 2000s. From 2012\u20132016, Roshan was placed on Forbes India's Celebrity 100\u2014a list based on the income and popularity of Indian celebrities\u2014peaking at ninth position in 2014 with an annual income of \u20b9850 million (US$13\u00a0million). A popular celebrity, Roshan has established himself as a sex symbol and a style icon in India. In 2006, Roshan was one of the four Bollywood actors, along with Priyanka Chopra, Kajol and Shah Rukh Khan, whose miniature dolls were launched in the United Kingdom, under the name of \"Bollywood Legends\". He topped The Times of India's listing of 50 Most Desirable Men in 2010 and ranked among the top five for the next five years. In 2010 and 2012, the Indian edition of GQ included him in their listing of Bollywood's best dressed men. A life-size, wax figure of him was installed at London's Madame Tussauds museum in January 2011, making him the fifth Indian actor to have been replicated as a wax statue there. Versions of the statue were installed at Madame Tussauds' museums in New York, Washington and other cities in the world. Roshan regularly features in the magazine Eastern Eye's listing of the 50 Sexiest Asian Men. He topped the list in 2011, 2012 and 2014, and featured among the top five in 2010, 2013, 2015 and 2016. Following the success of his debut film, Roshan signed on for endorsement deals with Coca-Cola, Tamarind and Hero Honda, all for three years and for at least \u20b930 million (US$460,000). As of 2010, he is celebrity endorser for such brands and products as Provogue, Parle Hide and Seek, Reliance Communications and Hero Honda. The Times of India reported that Roshan received \u20b912 million (US$190,000) to \u20b915 million (US$230,000) for each endorsement, making him one of the highest-paid male celebrity endorsers. Roshan's most critically and commercially successful films include: For his roles in the films Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, Koi... Mil Gaya, Dhoom 2 and Jodhaa Akbar, Roshan won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. He also won Best Male Debut for Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai and Best Actor (Critics) for Koi... Mil Gaya."

        "artist_name": "Irrfan_Khan", 
        "biography": " Sahabzade Irfan Ali Khan (born 7 January 1967), credited as Irrfan Khan or simply Irrfan, is an Indian film actor known for his work predominantly in Hindi cinema. He is also known for his works in British cinema, and Hollywood. Film critics, contemporaries, and other experts consider him to be one of the finest actors in Indian cinema for his versatile and natural acting. In 2011, Khan received the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour for his contribution to the field of arts. Khan has garnered the National Film Award for Best Actor in the 60th National Film Awards 2012, for his performance in Paan Singh Tomar. Khan has won the 2014 Asian Film Award for Best Actor, three International Indian Film Academy Awards, three Filmfare Awards, an Independent Spirit Award nomination, and various international honours. He also hosted a television show and commercials. As of 2015, he had appeared in more than 50 Indian films in Bollywood, and a few international films, such as Life of Pi, New York, I Love You, The Amazing Spider-Man and Jurassic World, with a featured role alongside Tom Hanks in the 2016 adaptation of Dan Brown's novel Inferno. In September, 2015, he was appointed as the brand ambassador for \"Resurgent Rajasthan\", a campaign by the state government of Rajasthan.   Khan was born in Jaipur, Rajasthan, to a Muslim Pathan family. Khan's mother, Begum, was from the Tonk Hakim family, and his father, the late Jagirdar, was from the Khajuriya village near the Tonk district, and ran a tire business. Khan was studying for his MA degree when he earned a scholarship to study at National School of Drama (NSD) in New Delhi in 1984. As Khan comes from a Pathan family but is a vegetarian since childhood, his father often teased he was a \"Brahmin born in the family of Pathans\". Khan moved to Mumbai, where he acted in numerous television serials, including Chanakya, Bharat Ek Khoj, Sara Jahan Hamara, Banegi Apni Baat, Chandrakanta, Shrikant (Doordarshan), AnooGoonj on Doordarshan, Star Bestsellers (Star Plus), and Sparsh. Earlier, he had acted in a teleplay on Doordarshan named Laal Ghaas Par Neele Ghode where he played Lenin. It was based on a translation by Uday Prakash of a Russian play by Mikhail Shatrov. He was the main villain in a series called Darr (which aired on Star Plus), where he played the role of a psycho serial killer, opposite Kay Kay Menon. He also played the role of famous revolutionary Urdu poet and Marxist political activist of India Makhdoom Mohiuddin in Kahkashan, produced by Ali Sardar Jafri. He acted in some of the episodes of Star Bestsellers (aired on Star-Plus). In one of the episodes (Ek Sham Ki Mulakat), his role was of a parchoon shopkeeper who has a misconception that his landlord's wife is trying to seduce him and it turns out that his own wife (Tisca Chopra) is cheating on him. In the other one, he played the role of an office accountant who, after being insulted by his female boss, took revenge. He also appeared in a serial called Bhanvar (aired on SET India) for two episodes. In one episode, he performed the role of a thug who somehow lands in court. Theatre and television kept him afloat until Mira Nair offered him a cameo in Salaam Bombay! (1988) though his role was edited out in the final film. In the 1990s, he appeared in the critically acclaimed films Ek Doctor Ki Maut and Such a Long Journey (1998) and various other films which went unnoticed. After many unsuccessful films, things changed when London-based director Asif Kapadia gave him the lead in The Warrior, a historical film completed in 11 weeks on location in Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. In 2001 The Warrior opened in international film festivals, making Khan a known face. In 2003\u201304 he acted in Ashvin Kumar's short film, Road to Ladakh.

I remember when he would come home, he would head straight for the bedroom, sit on the floor, and read books. The rest of us would be hanging around gossiping.\" Even now, as he reads through at least one new Hollywood script a week, he believes in doing his homework, staying up till 3 in the morning, taking notes, trying to understand ways to play his character. Sikdar recalls how he would demand as many as 11 rewrites from her when he directed episodes of Banegi Apni Baat. \"Once he dragged me to a police station in Mumbai to understand procedure,\" she recalls.

        "biography": " Jaya Bhaduri Bachchan (Bengali: \u099c\u09af\u09bc\u09be \u09ad\u09be\u09a6\u09c1\u09a1\u09bc\u09c0) (born Jaya Bhaduri; 9 April 1948) is an Indian film actress and politician. She is recognised as one of the finest Hindi film actresses of her time, particularly known for reinforcing a naturalistic style of acting in both mainstream and 'middle-of-the-road' cinema. During her career, she won eight Filmfare Awards: including three for Best Actress and three for Best Supporting Actress, which makes her the overall most-awarded performer in the female acting categories, along with Nutan. She was awarded the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007. In 1992, she was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India. Making her film debut as a teenager in Satyajit Ray's Mahanagar (1963), Bachchan's first screen role as an adult was in Guddi (1971), directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, with whom she would collaborate in several films. She was noted for her performances in films including Uphaar (1971), Koshish (1972), Kora Kagaz (1974), among others.She appeared alongside her husband Amitabh Bachchan in films such as Zanjeer (1973), Abhimaan (1973), Chupke Chupke (1975), Mili (1975) and Sholay (1975). Following her marriage to actor Amitabh Bachchan and the birth of her children, Bachchan restricted her film work in the coming years and after her appearance in the 1981 film Silsila, she took an indefinite sabbatical from films. She returned to acting with Govind Nihalani's Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa in 1998. Since then, she has appeared in several commercially successful films such as Fiza (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), all which garnered her critical acclaim as well as several awards and nominations.   Jaya Bhaduri was born in Jabalpur to a Bengali Hindu family. Her mother is Indira Bhaduri and her father, Taroon Kumar Bhaduri, was a writer, journalist and stage artist. She did her schooling from St. Joseph's Convent Sr. Sec. School, Bhopal and was the head girl of her school. She was awarded the Best All-India N.C.C. Cadet Award during the Republic Day celebrations in 1966. Jaya Bachchan, an alumna of the Film and Television Institute of India, started her career with a supporting role in Satyajit Ray's Bengali film, Mahanagar at the age of 15, with Anil Chatterjee and Madhabi Mukherjee. Prior to this, she had appeared in two Bengali films: a 13-minute short film, Suman, and a Bengali comedy Dhanni Meye (1971), as Uttam Kumar's sister-in-law. Inspired by her experience with Ray, she decided to join Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune to learn acting, and passed out with the gold medal, and she was also picked out to play the eponymous role of Guddi in the 1971 Hrishikesh Mukherjee's film, Guddi in which she played a schoolgirl obsessed with film star Dharmendra. Guddi was a success, and she moved to Mumbai and soon picked other roles, however her role of a 14-year-old school girl, aided by her petite looks, created the girl-next-door image for her, which she was often associated with through the rest of her career. Though she tried to break out of the mould with glamorous roles as in Jawani Diwani (1972) and a negative character of the heroine faking amnesia, in Anamika (1973), she was mostly recognised for roles of this sort, which were credited with epitomising middle-class sensibility and which she played amiably in films of \"middle-cinema\" directors like Gulzar, Basu Chatterjee and indeed Hrishikesh Mukherjee. These films include Uphaar (1971), Piya Ka Ghar (1972), Parichay (1972), Koshish (1972) and Bawarchi (1972), with marked sensitivity. By now, she was a popular star. In Gulzar's Koshish (1973), Bhaduri and Sanjeev Kumar played a deaf couple who struggle through their difficulties as handicapped people. She described the film as \"a learning experience\" which motivated to do social work in future. She first acted with her future husband Amitabh Bachchan in the film, Bansi Birju (1972), followed by B.R. Ishara's Ek Nazar also in the same year. Amitabh had undergone a string of flops, and when most lead heroines refused to work him, in Salim-Javed scripted, Zanjeer (1973), she stepped into the film. The film turned out to be a hit and gave rise to Amitabh Bachchan's angry-young-man image. This was closely followed by their pairing in films like Abhimaan (1973), Chupke Chupke (1975) and Sholay (1975). Her daughter Shweta was born while Jaya and Amitabh were working on Sholay. Following this she retired from films and focused on raising her children. Her last film as a lead actress was Silsila (1981), opposite her husband. During the late 1980s, she wrote the story for the film Shahenshah (1988) which starred her husband in the lead. After a gap in film appearances of 18 years, she returned to acting with Govind Nihalani's Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa (1998), a film about the Naxalite movement. In 2000 she starred in Fiza for which she received the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award for her work. She also starred in Karan Johar's family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001) with her husband. She then starred in Karan Johar's next film, Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003) playing the role of Preity Zinta's mother, Jennifer, for which she again received a Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award. She appeared with her son Abhishek in the films Laaga Chunari Mein Daag (2007) and Drona (2008). In 2011, she appeared in the Bangladeshi film Meherjaan starring with Victor Banerjee and Humayun Faridi. The film is based on a Bangladesh-Pakistan love story in the backdrop of 1971 Bangladesh atrocities. It is the story of Meherjaan (played by Jaya Bachchan), a Bangladeshi woman who falls in love with a Pakistani army officer who refuses to join the war and saves her from being raped by other Pakistani troops, who do not however spare her cousin Neela and kill her father. Bachchan was first elected in 2004 as a Samajwadi Party member of parliament, representing Rajya Sabha, and in February 2010 she stated her intent to complete her term.[clarification needed] She was re-elected in 2012. Bachchan's speech during the music launch of film Drona in second half of 2008 was criticized by some sections of politicians in Maharashtra. In response to the film's director, Goldie Behl, making his introductory speech in English, she said \"Hum UP ke log hain, isliye Hindi mein baat karenge, Maharashtra ke log maaf kijiye\". (We are from UP, so we will speak in Hindi. People of Maharashtra, please excuse us) Subsequently, she encouraged actress Priyanka Chopra to speak in Hindi.Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray commented that Jaya had no business alluding to all the people of Maharashtra in that statement. He threatened to ban all Bachchan films unless Jaya apologized in a public forum for hurting Maharashtrians. MNS workers began to attack theaters screening The Last Lear starring her husband, Amitabh Bachchan. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut also criticized her statement saying: \"After making all your success and fortune in Mumbai, if you feel like saying that, we are from UP, its very unfortunate.\" Amitabh Bachchan tendered an apology for her statements on her behalf. On 3 June 1973, she married actor Amitabh Bachchan. The couple has two children: Shweta Bachchan-Nanda and Abhishek Bachchan, who is also an actor. Shweta is married to industrialist Nikhil Nanda of Kapoor family in Delhi, and has two children, Navya Naveli and Agastya Nanda, while Abhishek Bachchan is married to Aishwarya Rai, and has a daughter, Aaradhya Bachchan.

        "biography": " Jaya Prada (born 3 April 1962) is an Indian film actress and politician. She has starred in Telugu, Tamil, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali and Marathi films. She was a Member of Parliament (MP) from Rampur from 2004 to 2014.   Jaya Prada was born as Lalita Rani in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh. Her father, Krishna Rao, was a Telugu film financier. Her mother, Neelaveni, was a home-maker and a very pious lady. The young Lalitha attended a Telugu-medium school in Rajahmundry and was also enrolled in dance and music classes at an early age. When Jaya Prada was 14 years old, she performed a dance at her school's annual function. A film director in the audience offered her a three-minute dance number in the Telugu film Bhoomi Kosam. She was hesitant, but her family encouraged her to accept it. She was paid only 10 rupees for her work in the film, but the rushes of those three minutes of film were shown to the major figures of the Telugu film industry. Major filmmakers offered her starring roles in quality films, and she accepted them.She became a huge star in 1976 at the age of 17 with major hit films. Director K. Balachander's black-and-white film Anthuleni Katha (1976) showcased her dramatic skills; K. Viswanath's color film Siri Siri Muvva (1976) showed her playing a mute with excellent dancing skills; and her title role as Sita in the big-budget mythological film Seetha Kalyanam confirmed her versatility. In 1977, she starred in Adavi Ramudu, which broke box office records and which permanently cemented her star status. The song \"Aaresukoboyi Paresukunnanu\" performed by Prada and co-star N.T. Rama Rao became a mass hit. Important filmmakers were casting her and repeating her in their films. Filmmaker Vijay introduced her to Kannada cinema in his 1977 super hit movie Sanadi Appanna alongside Kannada matinee idol Raj Kumar. The movie is also known to be the only movie to feature shehnai rendition by Ustad Bismillah Khan. Jaya Prada repeated her successful pairing with Raj Kumar in films like Huliya Halina Mevu (1979), Kaviratna Kalidasa (1983) and Shabdavedhi (2000). In 1979, K. Balachander repeated her in Tamil film Ninaithale Inikkum opposite Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth in which she played a terminally-ill patient. She continued to act in more films in Telugu opposite actors such NTR, ANR, Krishna, Krishnam Raju and Sobhan Babu throughout the 70s and 80s. K. Viswanath remade Siri Siri Muvva (1976) in Hindi as Sargam introducing Jayaprada to Bollywood in 1979. The film was successful and she became a star there as well. She earned her first Filmfare nomination as Best Actress but couldn't capitalize on her success since she couldn't speak Hindi. In 1981, she starred in the critically acclaimed Tamil film 47 Natkal for filmmaker K. Balachander in which Chiranjeevi played her villainous, bigamist husband. After she took Hindi lessons, director K. Vishwanath relaunched her in Hindi films, with the hit film Kaamchor where she spoke Hindi fluently for the first time. She was now able to consistently work in Hindi films, and earned two more Filmfare nominations as Best Actress for playing Amitabh Bachchan's endearing girlfriend in Prakash Mehra's Sharaabi (1984) and for her challenging double role in K. Vishwanath's Sanjog. Saagara Sangamam directed by K. Vishwanath, starring Kamal Hassan proved to be a milestone in her career, winning her lot of accolades including Filmfare Award for Best Actress - Telugu in 1983. Jaya made a successful team not just with Amitabh Bachchan and Jeetendra, but also with her immediate screen rival Sridevi, with whom she has acted in about a dozen films. Their hit Telugu film Devatha (1982), where they played sisters who made huge sacrifices for each other, was remade into the hit Hindi film Tohfa (1984). These films endeared Jaya Prada to the traditional conservative section of film goers and she amassed a huge female fan following as well. It was an image that would serve her well when she started a new career as a politician. In 1985, she acted in Malayalam film Iniyum Katha Thudarum directed by Joshiy starring Mammootty, Baby Shalini and Ambika. The film portrayed her playing wife of Mammootty, leading to a tragic end of mother and daughter, film ends Mammootty taking revenge on his family's death. Indian director Satyajit Ray described her as was one of the prettiest women in the world. Although, she has acted in Bengali films, she has never worked for Ray. (She claimed that Ray had her in mind for a film, but his illness and subsequent death prevented their collaboration). Jayaprada had a pairing with Aditya Pancholi in Zakhmi Zameen (1990). As she became involved in her political career since 1994, at the age of 32, her involvement with films reduced. In 2000, She acted in a Malayalam film Devadoothan starring Mohanlal directed by Sibi Malayil.The film garnered immensely popular reviews from the critics but failed at the box-office. But it met with great appreciation from the audience when released in Home Media and when aired on television. This movie had evergreen hit songs. In 2004,She acted in Ee Snehatheerathu Malayalam film as Kunchacko Boban's mother. In 2002, she stepped into the Marathi film industry by being a guest in the movie Aadhaar. Thus far, she acted in eight languages and has completed 300 films during a 30-year film career. She started playing mature roles in 2004. She also owns the Jaya Prada Theater in Chennai. In 2011, she returned to Malayalam screens with a strong role in Pranayam, alongside Mohanlal and Anupam Kher. She played the role of 'Grace' in this film which won her critical acclaim and several awards. Her 2012 Kannada film Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna (Sangolli Rayanna) that saw her donning the historical role of courageous Kittur Chennamma, completed 100 days at the box office. In 1986, she married producer Srikanth Nahata, who was already married to Chandra and had 3 children. This marriage stirred a lot of controversy, especially since Nahata did not divorce his current wife and had children with his first wife after marrying Jaya Prada. Jaya Prada and Srikanth have no children together, although she had at one time expressed desire to have children. Jayaprada joined the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 1994 at the invitation of its founder, N. T. Rama Rao, on the eve of the assembly elections, and rose quickly through the ranks. At that time there was speculation that she would run for election, but she preferred not to make her electoral debut, although she was offered a seat by Rao. She campaigned in several constituencies in 1994. When Rao became the Chief minister in 1994, he appointed one of his sons-in-law Nara Chandrababu Naidu as the Revenue Minister. Soon after the formation of the government, Rao's health started deteriorating, and in response to the growing influence of his wife, Lakshmi Parvati, on the political decisions of NTR, Chandrababu Naidu convinced a majority of the TDP MLAs to elect him as the chief minister. Since most of the legislators had gone over to his side, the Anti Defection Law did not apply and the Telugu Desam Party label passed on to the Chandrababu Naidu faction. During this period, Prada too joined the Chandrababu Naidu faction of the party. She was nominated to the Rajya Sabha representing Andhra Pradesh in 1996. She also held the post of Telugu Mahila President. Following differences with party Supremo N. Chandrababu Naidu, she left the TDP to join Samajwadi Party. She contested from Rampur parliamentary Constituency in UP during the 2004 General election and got elected with a margin of more than 85000 votes. During her campaign for the Lok Sabha elections in 2009, she was issued a notice by the Election Commission for violating the code of conduct by distributing bindis to women in Rampur's Swar locality. On 11 May 2009, Jaya Prada alleged that senior Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan was distributing nude pictures of her. She was re-elected with a margin of more than 30,000 votes. After she came out in open support of the former General Secretary of Samajwadi Party, Amar Singh, Prada was expelled from the party on 2 February 2010 for allegedly indulging in anti-party activities and damaging party's secular image. Amar Singh, along with Jaya Prada floated his own political party, Rashtriya Lok Manch, in 2011, and fielded candidates in 360 of the 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh in the 2012 assembly polls. However his party did not win a single seat in these election. Later she, along with Amar Singh joined the RLD on 10 March 2014 and then after that she got the ticket to contest from Bijnor seat in 2014 general elections. She, however, lost the election. Jayaprada made her debut to small screen with Local TV's show Jayapradam where she was the host of the show and interviewed many of the celebrated actors, technicians including Kamal Hassan, Chiranjeevi, K. Viswanath, ANR, Ram Gopal Varma and many others. The show made her closer to the Telugu audience again."

Jeetendra got his first major break of his life with V. Shantaram's Geet Gaya Pattharon Ne (1964). However, it was the film Farz (1967) that served as his stepping stone to success. The tee shirt and white shoes he picked up from a retail store for the Mast Baharon Ka Main Aashiq number in Farz, became his trademark. Farz was followed by films like \u2018Caravan\u2019 and \u2018Humjoli\u2019, in which Jeetendra had more dance numbers. His vigorous dancing in the films won him the epithet, \u2018Jumping Jack of Bollywood\u2019.

Besides his frequent pairings with Sridevi and Jaya Prada during the '80s, Jeetendra's popular co-stars were Reena Roy, Neetu Singh, Hema Malini, Sulakshana Pandit, Bindiya Goswami, Moushumi Chatterjee, and Rekha. On Television, he appeared in the TV serial Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi in the role of an old man. He was one of the judges of Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa (Indian Dance Series), an Indian dance competition on Sony Entertainment Television.[citation needed] He was also a judge with Hema Malini of a competition called Dancing Queen.[citation needed] Jeetendra had met his wife, Shobha, when she was only 14. She completed school, went to college, and was employed as an Air Hostess with British Airways. When Jeetendra was struggling between 1960-66 to establish himself as an actor, he was in relationship with Shobha and Shobha was his girlfriend till 1972. It was not until the release of Bidaai on October 18, 1974, that Jeetendra and Shobha decided to get married, which they did in a simple ceremony on at Janki Kutir with only a few family and friends present (Gulzar, Rajesh Khanna and Sanjeev Kumar amongst the noted celebrities). In her authorized biography, Hema Malini claimed that they almost got married, but she backed out. Jeetendra and Shobha have two children from their marriage. Their daughter, Ekta Kapoor, runs Balaji Telefilms and their son Tusshar Kapoor is also an actor. Jeetendra made a brief appearance in one of his daughter's produced films Kucch To Hai, a thriller movie released in 2002, where he appeared alongside his son Tusshar."

He also spent his early years in Yakutpura, an old city of Hyderabad where he learnt the unique style of comedy acting. During a Hindustan Lever Ltd company function, he mimicked a few senior officers, and from that day on, the workers said he was not John Rao (his real name), he was Johny Lever. When he later joined the industry, he decided to keep the name. He started to perform stand-up comedy in musical shows (orchestras), Tabassum Hit Parade and after earning fame, joined the group of Kalyanji-Anandji, a legendary music direction duo. Even before joining Hindustan Lever, he was giving stage performances. As because of his growing absenteeisms and since he was earning well from stage shows, he quit HLL in the year 1981. He did a lot of shows and world tours with them, one of his first big tours being with Amitabh Bachchan in 1982. At one of his shows, actor Sunil Dutt noticed his talent and potential and offered him his first movie Dard Ka Rishta. During this period, he also did few commercials for Kachua chhap incense, directed by Shekhar Kapoor. In 1986, he performed in a charity show called \"Hope 86\", in front of members of the Hindi film industry as a filler and was loved by audience.

I was helpless and turned to God for help. I stopped working in films and spent all my time praying for him. Ten days later, when he was taken for a test, the doctors were surprised because the cancer had vanished. It was the beginning of a new life for me. In 1998, Lever was convicted and sentenced to seven days imprisonment for disrespecting the Indian National Anthem, constitution and the flag at a private function hosted by Anees Ibrahim Kaskar, brother of global terrorist Dawood Ibrahim, head of the infamous D-Company.

        "artist_name": "Johnny_Walker_(actor)", 
        "biography": " Johnny Walker (11 November 1920 \u2013 29 July 2003) is the screen name of an Indian movie comedian, who acted in around 300 movies. He was born as Badruddin Jamaluddin Kazi in Indore, British India, the son of a mill worker. His father was made redundant and the family moved to Bombay (now Mumbai). The son took various jobs as the sole breadwinner for the family, eventually becoming a bus conductor with Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST).   One of the earliest and best-loved comedians of Indian Cinema, Johnny Walker brought smiles and amusement to all whenever he was on film. Christening himself after the famous Scotch whisky, Walker would drive audiences wild with laughter with his squeaky voice, pencil-thin moustache and his now-classic drunken antics. Everyone, cast, crew and audience alike, loved his iconic image of the hero's comic and often drunk sidekick. Ironically, his drunken image was a stark contrast to his real-life persona, which was that of a sober and humble soul. Johnny Walker was born in the early 1920s to a mill-worker in Indore. Born to a Muslim family he was named Badruddin Jamaluddin Kazi at birth. The mill in which his father worked closed and the family, of which Walker was the second of ten children, moved to Maharashtra. There Kazi tried his hand at several jobs, and eventually secured a post as a bus conductor in the B.E.S.T (Bombay Electric Supply and Transport) bus service.Johnny Walker became the sole breadwinner, travelling many miles and at unsocial hours in order at various times to buy and then sell ice candy, fruit, vegetables, stationery and other goods. Throughout his youth he dreamed of being involved in films, idolising Noor Mohammed Charlie and practising stunts that he saw on screen. Walker took a job with BEST as a bus conductor in Bombay. While thus employed, he continued to nurture his desire to work in films and entertained his passengers with amusing routines, hoping that he would at some point be spotted by someone with connection to the movie industry. His wish came true, although the details are unclear. Balraj Sahni saw him, perhaps on a bus or perhaps while Walker was amusing the cast of Hulchul, a film for which he had obtained a bit part, with an extemporised routine as a drunk. Sahni, who sources say was either at that time writing the script for Baazi (1951) or acting in Hulchul, told Walker to demonstrate his drunkard act to Guru Dutt. From that meeting he gained a role in Baazi. It was Dutt who gave him the name of Johnny Walker, a reference to the brand of Scotch whisky, when he was inspired by Kazi's display in the role of a drunkard. Thereafter, Walker appeared in all but one of Dutt's movies and the director encouraged him to ad lib and to draw on his varied life experiences. He was primarily an actor of comedic roles but towards the end of his life became disenchanted, saying, \"Earlier, comedians had a respectable position and an almost parallel role with the protagonist, now it is just to bring a touch of humour. I don't buy that.\" His attempts to portray heroic personae in the eponymous Johnny Walker and Mr. Quartoon were not successful but films such as Mere Mehboob, C.I.D., Pyaasa and Chori Chori made him a star. His heyday was in the 1950s and 1960s and his later career was affected by the death of Dutt, who had greatly influenced it, in 1964. He worked with directors such as Bimal Roy and Vijay Anand but his career faded in the 1980s. He was unwilling to adopt the cruder form of comedy and changed priorities that had become the vogue, saying that In those days we used to do clean comedy. We were aware that the person who had come to the cinema had come with his wife and children\u00a0... the story was the most important thing. Only after selecting a story would Abrar Alvi and Guru Dutt find suitable actors! Now it's all upside down\u00a0... they line up a big hero and find a story to fit in. The comedian has ceased to be a character, he's become something to fit in between scenes.\u00a0... I opted out because comedy had become hostage to vulgarity. I acted in 300 films and the Censor Board never cut even one line. Walker was particularly satisfied with his work in B. R. Chopra's Naya Daur (1957), Chetan Anand's Taxi Driver (1954) and Bimal Roy's Madhumati (1958). His final film came after an absence of 14 years when he took a role in a remake of Mrs. Doubtfire titled Chachi 420 (1997). During the intervening period, he had a successful business dealing with precious and semi-precious stones Aside from acting, Walker also sang in many films. Some of those songs were written especially for him. His drawing power at the box office was such that distributors would insist on him having a song and would pay extra to ensure it. He also attempted to produce a film himself but decided to abandon it. Johnny Walker married Noor (short for Noorjahan), a sister of Shakila, despite the opposition of her family. They had three daughters and three sons. Regretting that he had been forced to leave school at 6th standard, he sent his sons to the US for schooling. One of them, Nasir Khan, has since worked for Channel V and has acted in Dam Dum Diga Diga. Despite often playing the roles of a drunk, Walker was a teetotaller. Walker acted in around 300 films, including:"

        "artist_name": "Juhi_Chawla", 
        "biography": " Juhi Chawla (born November 13, 1967) is an Indian actress, model, film producer, and the winner of the Miss India beauty contest in 1984. Chawla has worked predominantly in Hindi language films, in addition to Punjabi, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu, and Bengali language films. A leading actress in the late 1980s, 1990s and early-2000s, Chawla has garnered particular praise for her comic timing and vivacious on-screen persona. Chawla made her film debut in Sultanat (1986), and received wider public recognition with the highly successful tragic romance Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988), for which she won the Filmfare Award for Lux New Face of the Year. She went on to establish herself as a leading actress of Hindi cinema with the films Swarg (1990), Pratibandh (1990), Bol Radha Bol (1992), Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman (1992), Lootere (1993), Aaina (1993), Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke (1993), for which she won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress, Darr (1993), Deewana Mastana (1997), Yes Boss (1997) and Ishq (1997). In the 2000s, Chawla began working with independent filmmakers in art-house projects, garnering critical acclaim for her work in Jhankaar Beats (2003), 3 Deewarein (2003), My Brother Nikhil (2005), Bas Ek Pal (2006), I Am (2011), Gulaab Gang (2014) and Chalk n Duster (2016). In addition to acting, Chawla is a television personality, a humanitarian, and the co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders. She married the industrialist Jay Mehta in 1995 and has two children with him.   Juhi Chawla was born in Ambala, Haryana, India. Her father was an officer of the Indian Revenue Service (IRS). She is the aunt of actress Kiara Advani. She completed her schooling from Fort Convent School, Mumbai, and graduated from Sydenham College, Mumbai with a specialisation in HR. She was the winner of Miss India title in 1984. Later she won Best Costume Award for the Miss Universe contest in 1984. She is also an accomplished dancer. In a Baaje Payal (a film based on a collection of interviews for dancers/actresses) interview, she mentioned having learned Kathak for three years and regretted giving it up as it could have helped her in her career as an actress. She is also an accomplished classical singer and has been training for the last six years. Chawla ventured into films with the 1986 Sultanat, the film turned out to be a commercial failure. She went on to act in Kannada classic Premaloka directed by Ravichandran in 1987, the film became a Blockbuster upon its release and Chawla's performance was well received by the critics and the audience alike. Her first major role in Bollywood was in Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak in 1988, in which she starred with Aamir Khan. The film, a modern-day adaption of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, became both a major critical and commercial success. A film critic[who?] wrote \"Juhi Chawla already shows that she's here to stay. Not only is she naturally vivacious but she, in a wonderfully subtle way, displays Rashmi's innocence, childlikeness and determination. It's no surprise that since then Aamir and Juhi have been popular for their on screen chemistry.\" Another critic[who?] wrote \"Though most people give credit to Aamir, this film is a classic more because of Juhi. Her charm and charisma including her \"next-door girl\" image created a phenomenon in India. Her plain yet so elegant salwar-suits or her innocent smile that made people crazy.\" It won the Filmfare Best Movie Award, and Chawla won the Filmfare Award for Lux New Face of the Year and received her first nomination for Filmfare Best Actress Award. The film has since attained cult status, with the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama crediting it as a \"path-breaking and trend setting film\" for Indian cinema. In 1990, she starred in Pratibandh, which was a box office success and her performance was lauded by critics, as written \"Most of Juhi Chawla's sequences are worth the watch just for her terrific performance. She is simply superb as Shanti, a toy seller who finds herself charged with murder.\" She also received her second nomination for the Filmfare Best Actress Award for the film. Her other release of the year was the family drama Swarg alongside Rajesh Khanna and Govinda, that marked her first of many collaborations with David Dhawan and Govinda. The film was one of the highest grossers of the year. In 1992, she appeared in the super hit Bol Radha Bol alongside Rishi Kapoor, for which she received her third Filmfare nomination for best actress. A critic wrote[clarification needed] \"Juhi was as perfect as one could wish. As a simple village belle with feisty nature she was just lovely to look at, and even after getting a sexy make-over in the second part there was still beautiful innocence to her. Her comic timing was spot on as always\". Later that year she appeared in Aziz Mirza's comedy Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, the film was her first of many collaborations with Shahrukh Khan. The film was a success at the box-office and garnered immense praise for the performances and the chemistry of the lead actors. A critic stated \"Juhi Chawla as a normal middle class working woman is delightful to see. She's got guts to charm everyone by her very sensitive and sensible acting.\" Shahrukh Khan attributed the success of the film to Chawla as she was a big star at that time and he still a newcomer. In 1993 she appeared in four of the top-grossing productions of the year. Her first release was the multi-starrer Lootere opposite Sunny Deol, Naseeruddin Shah, Chunkey Pandey and Anupam Kher; the film was a success[clarification needed] at the box office. She was praised for her acting and look in the film; a film critic[clarification needed] wrote \"Juhi Chawla sheds her girl-next-door image with Lootere and transforms into Bollywood sex siren with 'Main Teri Rani Tu Raja Mera' song. Performance wise Chawla steals the show. Her acting is flawless and her screen presence and beauty make it all the better.\" Her next release was Aaina co-starring Jackie Shroff, and was produced by Yash Chopra, the film was a big hit at the box office, solidifying Chawla's position as the leading lady of the 90's. The critics praised her performance in the film and wrote \"1993 was Juhi Chawla's year with such films as Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke in which she delivered an excellent comic performance, and Darr, for which many still remember her as that highly desired \"K-k-k-kiran\". I actually like her more either in comedy or in roles of smart and sophisticated women, but this one definitely works. Her fragility looks very natural and so does her character's gradual transformation.\" Her third release was Mahesh Bhatt's romantic comedy Hum Hain Rahi Pyaar Ke opposite Aamir Khan, which many critics called her career best performance. Critics wrote \"Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla have already proved to be a great on screen pair and here they shine once again. Aamir Khan is effective in a suitably restrained performance but it is Juhi Chawla who steals the show with her comic nirvana. Easily she is the funniest actor in the history of Hindi cinema and it would be a tough challenge for any actor to match up to that. Moreover, her effortless dialogue delivery in Tamil (especially for someone who doesn't speak the language) only further prove what a gifted actress she is.\" Another critic wrote \" The film ultimately belongs to Juhi. Because she is the soul of all things. She is the active reason of things happening. She is the fun. She is that innocence people love. It is difficult to imagine any other actress in this role. Such is her natural charm and comic sense in this one, and she truly deserved the Filmfare she received. Looking sweet and simply throughout the film she makes you smile with her mere presence. This is definitely her best performance. Add to it she is acting opposite Aamir (the most popular pairings of the '90s), the two compliment each other and share a crackling chemistry and you are left with a feeling of bliss\". The pairing of Chawla with Khan (one of the most popular on screen pairing of the '90s) resulted in hype over the film's release, and it proved a major commercial and critical success. Her comic-dramatic performance met with unanimous critical acclaim and won her several awards, including the Filmfare Best Actress Award for her performance in the film. Her last release of the year was Yash Chopra's thriller Darr, alongside Shahrukh Khan and Sunny Deol. The film went on to become a blockbuster upon its release and was one of the highest grossing films of the year, making it Chawla's fourth consecutive box office hit of the year. Darr was also a major critical success, winning several awards including the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. Her performance as Kiran, a girl caught between one man's love and other man's obsession was widely appreciated and to date remains one of her most memorable performances. A critic wrote \"In Darr she gets to display all her talent, be it the frightened look on her face on seeing Rahul, be it the twinkle in the eyes during the song Tu hai meri Kiran or the comic chemistry with Anupam Kher, it is one of her best performances.\" Rediff stated \"Sensuous, seductive, gorgeous, cute, vulnerable -Juhi looked every bit of a dream girl her Kiran needed to be.\" Chawla's curly hair and off shoulder dress became the trademark in 90s with her blockbuster Darr. All these successes made her the most successful actress of the year. Most of Chawla's films released in 1994\u20136 were unsuccessful, though she appeared in Saajan Ka Ghar alongside Rishi Kapoor, Ram Jaane alongside Shahrukh Khan, Naajayaz alongside Ajay Devgan and Loafer alongside Anil Kapoor all of which were moderately successful at the box office. She received critical accalaim for her performance of a battered wife in Abbas Mustan's thriller Daraar, she received a Filmfare nomination for her performance in the film . Critics praised her performance immensely, they wrote \"Juhi was really amazing in the second half. She is both vulnerable and powerful, and she looks gorgeous. Her portrayal of the abused woman, who simply decides that enough is enough, is extremely sensitive and believable. She breaks your heart pleading with her husband as he prepares to give her a beating, you fear for her in her plight, and you are proud of her once she faces him.\" She bounced back in 1997 with top grossing romantic comedies Yes Boss, Deewana Mastana and Ishq. Ishq became one of the top-earners of the year and achieved blockbuster status. Her performance in the film was widely appreciated. A critic wrote \"It is Juhi Chawla, however, who steals the show with her high voltage comic delivery that is, appropriately, screamingly funny. Even in the parts when Indra Kumar has seemingly asked her to 'stretch' to be funny, she carries the scenes off with aplomb and skill. Her chemistry with Aamir is undeniable and the most memorable portions of the film revolve around their relationship.\" Another critic wrote \"Juhi Chawla is very pretty and good fun to watch, and it is her very energetic performance that makes the film extremely interesting and comical.\" Her other release of the year, Yes Boss co-starring Aditya Pancholi and Shahrukh Khan was also a major commercial and a critical success, Chawla's portrayal of Seema Mathur was lauded by critics and she received her sixth Filmfare nomination for her portrayal of a model in the film. Critics wrote \"Juhi Chawla is astonishing and enchanting as Seema. She displays both decisiveness, liveliness and confusion, and shows many sides of her personality, including dreaminess, love, anger and compassion. The growth in her character is believable, and as expected she is splendid in comic sequences.\" Planet Bollywood said \"This is Chawla's best movie, she stands beautiful and can easily outshine other actresses in acting as well as looks. Her acting is the strong point of the film and this film gives her the chance to portray a multilayered character and show how her versatility.\" In the comedy Deewana Mastana, Chawla played the role of Dr. Neha Sharma, who forms the love interest of Kapoor and Govinda and ends up marrying Salman Khan. Planet Bollywood wrote \"Juhi needs to look gorgeous in the movie, while showing indifference towards the monkeys who are after her. She is impeccable in the acting requirements, but looking beautiful is not always easy since working in a David Dhawan movie requires the hero and heroine to wear garishly coloured/designed outfits. However, in the end Juhi probably won over David and in the entire film her attire and looks could both kill\". The film was a major commercial success and performed extremely well at the box office. Her other release of the year was Mr and Mrs Khiladi alongside Akshay Kumar. The film turned out to be an average grosser and Chawla's performance received immense appreciation. A critic wrote \" Juhi Chawla, as usual has done wonders in the film and her chirpy, zestful role proves her comic talent, that no other Indian actress has.\" Another critic said \" As expected Juhi Chawla dominates the show with her perfect comic timing. Indian women are never expected to be funny, but Juhi gets all the respect in my book for being the reigning comic beauty of India.\" Planet Bollywood while reviewing the film wrote \" Juhi's comedic timing (as well as her look in the movie) is near perfection\". In 1998 she appeared once again alongside Shahrukh Khan in Duplicate, the film was produced by Yash Johar and was directed by Mahesh Bhatt. The film underperformed at the box office upon its release. However, Chawla won much appreciation for her performance and her chemistry with Khan was also appreciated. A critic wrote \"Juhi Chawla is one of my favourite actresses and she is simply wonderful here. I\u2019m not sure how she manages to keep a straight face through some of Shah Rukh\u2019s more insane moments, but she plays Sonia as quite a serious career woman with a tendency to lecture in English. Although I do prefer her romance with Shah Rukh in Yes Boss they still make a sweet couple here.\" The same year she appeared in Hrishikesh Mukherjee's swan song Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kaate alongside Anil Kapoor, her performance was appreciated by the audiences and critics alike. Rediff while reviewing the film wrote \" Only Juhi as the daughter is not based on any character from Hrishida's collection. She carries off her role with her inevitable chirpiness, and looks very good too. Hrishida was right when he told me that Juhi's serene face suited the kind of sacrifice she would make in the film. Only Jaya Bhaduri has managed that serenity in Hrishida's films.\" However the film flopped at the box-office. The same year she also appeared in Priyadarshan's rural drama Saat Rang Ke Sapne opposite Arvind Swamy. Though the film underperformed at the box-office, Chawla's portrayal of a gypsy met with immense critical appreciation. The same year she also appeared in the Malayalam detective comedy film Harikrishnans opposite Mammootty and Mohanlal. Her performance in the film was met with appreciation. The film received a great pre-release hype due to the combined screen presence of Mohanlal, Mammootty and Juhi Chawla. Harikrishnans turned out to be a blockbuster at the Kerala box-office, it was the highest grossing Malayalam film of 1998. In 1999 she appeared in Arjun Pandit alongside Sunny Deol, the film was a success at the box office and Chawla received favorable reviews for her role with shades of grey in the film, a critic while reviewing the film for planet Bollywood wrote \"Juhi is great during the climax as already mentioned, her character has several shades, in the first half she is bubbly and fun loving and later on her character takes a U turn, her performance shows her versatility and she clearly overshadows the hero in the film, she gives a great performance. Juhi makes the best of what she is given.\" The same year she also starred opposite Sanjay Dutt in the adventure film Safari, the film was a flop however Chawla's chemistry with Dutt was appreciated, a critic wrote \"Juhi and Sanjay visibly had great fun playing all this \u2013 watching them is sheer delight. Juhi is a dream \u2013 be it with leather cap and aviator goggles, in an appealing native outfit or after an involuntary mud-bath.\" Another critic wrote \"Juhi is very funny as Anjali, she finds herself out of her depth. In her element she is feisty and self-assured, making her a good foil for Sanjay\u2019s macho Kishan. They are sweet together.\" Chawla's pairing with Aamir Khan and their on-screen chemistry was often cited by the media as successful. She has also teamed up with Shahrukh Khan in several movies, including Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, Darr, Duplicate and Yes Boss. Through the 2000s, Chawla started appearing in independent and art films, and her work in the genre included the critically acclaimed films 3 Deewarein, 7\u00bd Phere and My Brother Nikhil, which Taran Adarsh termed as \"amongst the finest in her career\" and Khalid Mohamed praised as \"perfect,\" stating that \"her effortless blend of conflicting emotions is what A-class acting is all about. Ms Chawla is a diamond in this little gem of a movie.\" She won a Star Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress for 3 Deewarein. She was seen in Nikhil Advani's Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute To Love for which she received good reviews. Critics wrote \"among women it is Juhi Chawla with her sensitive approach who has the greatest acting prowesness\" She starred with Urmila Matondkar in Bas Ek Pal (2006) and with Manoj Bajpai in Swami. Chawla then appeared in Ravi Chopra's Bhoothnath with Amitabh Bachchan, in which she made her singing debut with the song \"Chalo Jaane Do\", the film was a moderate success and Chawla was appreciated for her role. Another film called Krazzy 4 with Irfan Khan and Arshad Warsi was released in 2008, the film failed to do well at the box office. In 2009, she appeared in a guest appearance in Luck By Chance to play a comic part for which she dyed her hair blonde. The film and Chawla's performance got extremely positive reviews and got a good opening at the box office. Chawla has appeared in several non-Hindi language films. She has appeared in various Punjabi films: Shaheed Uddham Singh (2000), Des Hoyaa Pardes (2004), Waris Shah: Ishq Daa Waaris (2006) and \"Sukhmani \u2013 Hope for Life\" (2010). Her first Malayalam film was Harikrishnans, which also starred actors Mohanlal and Mammootty. In the beginning of her career she acted in Kannada films, which include the successful Premaloka and unsuccessful films like Shanthi Kranthi and Kindara Jogi. She acted with popular Kannada actor Ravichandran in all these three films. In 2011, Chawla starred in Onir's critically acclaimed feature I Am (2011). Unfolded in several chapters, the film starred Chawla alongside Manisha Koirala in an episode named \"I Am Megha\". She played the title role of which critic Taran Adarsh commented, \"It's a delight to watch Juhi and Manisha, after a hiatus. Both deliver striking performances \u2013 even getting the language right.\" For her performance, Chawla was awarded the Best Actress award at the 13th London Asian Film Festival and Award for Excellence in Hindi Cinema at the Asiavision Movie Awards. Chawla's performance also earned her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Chawla is the only top actress in the 1990s who has never worked with Salman Khan in a full-fledged role opposite him, although Salman Khan did a friendly appearance as her husband in the 1997 release Deewana Mastana. After appearing in art films and occasionally playing supporting roles and guest appearances throughout the decade, Chawla made a full-fledged comeback in 2014 with the heavily hyped woman-centric Gulaab Gang alongside her once arch rival Madhuri Dixit. This was the first time in her long career that she played the role of an antagonist. Her negative role in the film was widely appreciated and her performance earned rave reviews. Many critics called it her career best performance, and many critics said that Juhi Chawla\u2019s villainous avatar overpowers Madhuri Dixit Nene\u2019s heroic act. Bollywood life wrote \"It\u2019s quite surprising as well as delightful to watch Juhi, who is known for her angelic roles, playing a mean evil politico head. She sends policemen on sick leave when they refuse to bow in front of her. She takes revenge from people, who call her \u2018Soumitra\u2019 instead of addressing her as the \u2018Madamji\u2019. She mock tears during a political speech as she talks about her late husband and in the next scene curses the insurance company for not giving her the due money. Bollywood has got it\u2019s [sic] new villain in Juhi. Though the dhak-dhak girl enjoys more screen presence as compared to Juhi, it\u2019s the latter who shines brighter in this film.\" Emirates wrote \"This, however, works in favour of Juhi, who emerges far more influential and striking as the conniving politico head \u2018Madam\u2019. Devoid of any references to her earlier Bollywood image, Juhi sticks to her character, and brilliantly plays her various insecurities and her determination to strike out anyone in the race to political glory. And this, despite being given a role that\u2019s got far less prominence on the script than rebel frontrunner Rajjo. Although the character could have appeared jaded, Juhi plays it with impeccable restraint and concentrates on her wavering temperament with incredible flair, making this her most significant performance to date.\" Another critic wrote \"Though the project was widely promoted as a Madhuri Dixit film in its entire promotional campaign and print advertisements. But in reality its Juhi Chawla who makes a more killer impact in her first ever role of a vamp unarguably. Hence as an exciting surprise, here we have the beautiful Juhi in a completely new negative avatar played real well, offering a lot more than the viewer's expectations from the talented actress. In other words, where Madhuri's decent attempt struggles to make an instant connect due to her mixed language (accent) or all meaningless songs (dances), there Juhi takes the full advantage of this unintentional flaw and emerges as a clear winner in this on screen contest evidently.\" She eventually won the prestigious Best Actress award at the Dadasaheb Phalke Awards ceremony for her performance. It earned her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. She appeared with Helen Mirren and Om Puri in the Steven Spielberg-produced Hollywood film The Hundred Foot Journey. During the 2000s, Chawla has also been presenter and host of numerous television shows, particularly award ceremonies, including the Filmfare Awards and the Zee Cine Awards. Chawla has been a judge for the entertainment show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa alongside Saroj Khan and Vaibhavi Merchant during the show's third season. ===Producer===she is the one of Juhi later turned producer and became the co-owner of a production company called Dreamz Unlimited with Shahrukh Khan and director Aziz Mirza. The first two films produced by the production company were Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani and Asoka. Their third film, Chalte Chalte was the first success for the company. Chawla has been associated with a number of charities and social causes in India as well as Internationally. She espouses the fight against the deadly disease thalassaemia and has worked to organise events to raise money for the same. Chawla has also been on a mission to educate users on the perils of mobile phone radiation. She has been visiting schools, speaking at seminars, working with citizens groups and calling on ministers and authorities to drive her point home. In November 2015, she was bestowed with Indira Gandhi Memorial Award in Social Awareness for her active participation and selfless efforts towards creating awareness about the health hazards caused due to mobile tower antennae radiation. She has also donated eyes to a eye donation camp and urged people do donate blood also. In 2008, Chawla and her husband Jay Mehta in partnership with actor Shahrukh Khan acquired ownership rights for the franchise representing Kolkata in the Twenty20 cricket tournament Indian Premier League, for a price of 300 crore, around $75 million at the time and have since named the team Kolkata Knight Riders. As of 2009, KKR was one of the richest teams in the IPL and had been ranked as the most valued with a brand value of $42.1 million. Financially, Kolkata Knight Riders were the most profitable and successful franchise in the IPL as well. The team was surrounded with controversy and poor on-field performance through the first three years of the tournament. Its performance, however, improved from the fourth season and they eventually became the IPL champions for the first time in 2012. Juhi Chawla is married to industrialist Jay Mehta. The couple have two children: a daughter Jhanvi born in 2001 and a son Arjun born in 2003. In an interview Juhi revealed that Jhanvi wants to be a writer, instead of joining films. Jay Mehta and Juhi Chawla are the co-owners of the Indian Premier League team Kolkata Knight Riders in partnership with Shahrukh Khan under their company Red Chillies Entertainment. Her brother Bobby Chawla was the CEO of Red Chillies Entertainment. He suffered a massive stroke in 2010 after a dinner party. After being in coma for about four years, died at Jaslok Hospital on March 9, 2014."

        "artist_name": "Kajol", 
        "biography": " Kajol (born Kajol Mukherjee; 5 August 1974), is an Indian film actress, who predominantly works in Hindi cinema. Born into the Mukherjee-Samarth family, she is the daughter of actress Tanuja Samarth and late filmmaker Shomu Mukherjee. Regarded as one of India's most successful and highest-paid actresses, Kajol is the recipient of numerous accolades, including six Filmfare Awards, among twelve nominations. Along with her late aunt Nutan, she holds the record for most Best Actress wins at Filmfare, with five. In 2011, the Government of India awarded her with the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian honour of the country. After making her acting debut in the 1992 romance Bekhudi, with her mother Kajol had her first commercial success with the 1993 thriller Baazigar. She rose to prominence by featuring as the female lead in four of India's annually top-grossing romances\u2014Yeh Dillagi (1994), Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya (1998), Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha (1998) and Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain (1999)\u2014and received wide critical recognition for playing against type in the 1997 mystery film Gupt: The Hidden Truth, that earned her a Filmfare Award for Best Villain, and the 1998 psychological thriller Dushman. Her acclaimed portrayal of a conservative NRI in the blockbuster romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), a tomboy in the blockbuster romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), a lower middle class Punjabi woman in the blockbuster melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), a blind Kashmiri woman in the romantic thriller Fanaa (2006) and a divorced, single mother in the drama My Name Is Khan (2010) garnered her five Filmfare Awards for Best Actress. Following a five-year sabbatical from full-time acting in 2001, Kajol received praise for portraying the lead female roles in the dramas U Me Aur Hum (2008) and We Are Family (2010), and the comedy Dilwale (2015), the later of which rank among the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time. In addition to acting in films, Kajol is a social activist and is noted for her work with widows and children, for which she received the Karmaveer Puraskaar in 2008. She has featured as a talent judge for Zee TV's reality show Rock-N-Roll Family and holds a managerial position at Devgn Entertainment and Software Ltd. Kajol has been married to actor Ajay Devgan since 1999, with whom she has two children.   Kajol was born in Mumbai to the Mukherjee-Samarth film family of Bengali-Marathi descent. Her mother, Tanuja, is an actress, while her father Shomu Mukherjee was a film director and producer. Shomu died in 2008 after suffering cardiac arrest. Kajol's younger sister, Tanishaa Mukherjee is also an actress. Her maternal aunt was actress Nutan and her maternal grandmother, Shobhna Samarth, and great grandmother, Rattan Bai, were both involved in Hindi cinema. Her paternal uncles, Joy Mukherjee and Deb Mukherjee, are film producers, while her paternal and maternal grandfathers, Sashadhar Mukherjee and Kumarsen Samarth, were filmmakers. Kajol's cousins Rani Mukerji, Sharbani Mukherjee and Mohnish Behl are also Bollywood actors; whereas another cousin of hers, Ayan Mukerji is a director. Kajol describes herself as being \"extremely mischievous\" as a child. She added that she was very stubborn and impulsive from a very young age. Her parents separated when she was young; but according to Tanuja, Kajol was not affected by the split as \"we never argued in front of [her]\". In the absence of her mother, Kajol was looked after by her maternal grandmother, who \"never let me feel that my mother was away and working\". According to Kajol, her mother inculcated a sense of independence in her at a very young age. Growing up between two separate cultures, she inherited her \"Maharashtrian pragmatism\" from her mother and her \"Bengali temperament\" from her father. Kajol studied at the St Joseph Convent boarding school in Panchgani. Apart from her studies, she participated in extra-curricular activities, such as dancing. It was in school that she began to form an active interest in reading fiction, as it helped her \"through the bad moments\" in her life. At the age of sixteen, she began work on Rahul Rawail's film Bekhudi, which according to her was a \"big dose of luck\". She initially intended to return to school after shooting for the film during her summer vacations. However, she eventually dropped out of school to pursue a full-time career in film. On not completing her education, she quoted, \"I don't think I am any less well-rounded because I didn't complete school\". Kajol made her acting debut at the age of seventeen in the 1992 romantic drama Bekhudi alongside debutante Kamal Sadanah and her mother Tanuja, who in the film also played her mother. Kajol played Radhika, a girl who falls in love with Sadanah's character despite her parents' wish for her to marry another man. Although the film turned out to be a box office flop, Kajol's performance was noticed and she was signed for Baazigar (1993), a thriller by Abbas-Mustan, which emerged as a major commercial success. Inspired from the Hollywood film A Kiss Before Dying, the film co-starred Shah Rukh Khan, Shilpa Shetty and Siddharth Ray, and saw Kajol portray the leading role of Priya Chopra, a girl who falls in love with her sister's murderer. The film marked the first of her many collaborations with Khan. In 1994, Kajol featured in the melodrama Udhaar Ki Zindagi, as the granddaughter of the characters played by Jeetendra and Moushumi Chatterjee. The film, which was a remake of the hit Telugu film, Seetharamaiah Gari Manavaralu, failed to do well at the box-office. However, Kajol received praise for her performance and won the BFJA Award for Best Actress. She subsequently starred in and earned public recognition with Yash Raj Films's hit romantic drama Yeh Dillagi, alongside Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan. The film, which was an unofficial remake of the Hollywood film Sabrina, narrated the story of a chauffeur's daughter who becomes a model, and engages in a love triangle between two brothers. The success of Yeh Dillagi proved a breakthrough for Kajol and her performance in the film fetched her a first Best Actress nomination at the annual Filmfare Awards. In 1995, Kajol starred in two major commercial successes\u2014Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun and Aditya Chopra's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\u2014both opposite Shah Rukh Khan. The former was a melodramatic thriller, based on the concept of reincarnation, in which she played Sonia Saxena, a supporting character who forms the love interest of Khan. The film eventually emerged as the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. She justified playing a minor role in the film by saying, \"I did Karan Arjun because I wanted to know how it feels to be an ornament. I had nothing to do in the film except look good\". Kajol's next three releases that year\u2014Taaqat, Hulchul and Gundaraj\u2014failed to do well commercially; the latter two were her earliest collaborations with her future-husband, the actor Ajay Devgn. Kajol's fifth and final release of the year, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, was not only the biggest commercial success of 1995, but also one of the most successful films of all time in India. The film, which earned a worldwide gross of \u20b91.23 billion (US$19\u00a0million) at the time of release, has been continuously running in Mumbai ever since. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was also a major critical success; it won ten Filmfare Awards, and Kajol's performance as Simran Singh, a young Non-resident Indian from London who falls for Shah Rukh Khan's character was praised, earning her a first Filmfare Award for Best Actress. In 2005, Indiatimes Movies ranked the movie amongst the 25 Must See Bollywood Films, citing it as a \"trendsetter of sorts\". In that same year's retrospective review by Rediff, Raja Sen stated that Kajol was \"wisely picked ... to play Simran, the real-as-life actress bringing warmth and credulity to the initially prudish and reluctant Simran. Not to mention the on-screen chemistry that has become the stuff of legend.\" In 1996, Kajol starred in Vikram Bhatt's action drama Bambai Ka Babu, opposite Saif Ali Khan and Atul Agnihotri. Upon release, the film emerged as a major critical and commercial disaster. In 1997, her portrayal of Isha Diwan, a psychopath serial killer and obsessive lover, in Gupt: The Hidden Truth, was lauded by critics and proved to be a major turning point in her career. She explained that playing Diwan was the \"toughest role\" of her career as it was \"difficult to play a mean character\". In an interview with The Hindu, director Rajiv Rai quoted, \"[I] tapped the versatile artistry in Kajol in Gupt! [She] had a complex role and she certainly brought a rare finesse to her etching of that character in the film\". The suspense thriller, which co-starred Bobby Deol and Manisha Koirala, also emerged as a major commercial success. Kajol eventually became the first actress to be nominated in and win the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role. Following a leading role opposite Aditya Pancholi and Saif Ali Khan in Sanjay Gupta's box office flop, the reincarnation romance Hameshaa, Kajol starred as an aspiring nun in Rajiv Menon's Tamil film \u2013 the romantic drama Minsaara Kanavu \u2013 opposite Arvind Swamy and Prabhu Deva. Kajol revealed that she found dancing alongside Prabhu Deva difficult and it \"took me 20 retakes and 30 rehearsals\" to get the steps right. Her performance met with appreciation with The Indian Express reviewing, \"Kajol is full of beans and fits into her character with commendable ease. Hers is perhaps one of the most expressive faces of the present.\" The film was dubbed in Hindi as Sapnay and released in Northern India. The original Tamil version was a box-office success, but the dubbed version emerged as a commercial failure. Her next release was Indra Kumar's romantic comedy Ishq alongside Aamir Khan, Juhi Chawla and Ajay Devgn, in which she played Kajal, a poor girl in love with a rich boy, played by Devgn. Upon release, the film emerged as a major commercial success, with critical praise directed to the performances of the four leads. In 1998, Kajol established herself as a leading actress of contemporary Hindi cinema by featuring in three of the top-grossing productions of the year. Her first release that year was Sohail Khan's romantic comedy Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya, in which she played Muskaan Thakur, a naive village girl who falls in love with a rich boy (played by Salman Khan), but faces difficulties in convincing her elder brother about her relationship. The film not just emerged as a box office hit, but also garnered positive comments from critics, as did Kajol's performance. In her next release, the psychological thriller Dushman, Kajol played the dual roles of twin sisters, Sonia and Naina Saigal, alongside Sanjay Dutt and Ashutosh Rana. Directed by Tanuja Chandra and written by Mahesh Bhatt, the film revolves around Naina avenging the rape and murder of her sister, and won Kajol critical appreciation with reviewer Sukanya Verma writing, \"Kajol is in superb form, both as the opinionated career-minded twin who is murdered, and as the avenger. Even she must have preferred less glycerine and more restraint.\" Despite underperforming at the box-office, Dushman proved to be a major critical success. For her performance, Kajol won her first Screen Award for Best Actress and received a Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. She next starred opposite Ajay Devgn in Anees Bazmee's romantic comedy Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha, a remake of the Hollywood hit French Kiss. In the film, she played the comic role of Sanjana, a clumsy woman who travels from Paris to India in search of her philandering fianc\u00e9, however, falls for another man, played by Devgn. A review from Planet Bollywood noted, \"Kajol, like usual, is brilliant in her role as Sanjana. She makes you cry, laugh, get angry, and smile all within the two and a half hour movie. Her acting is on par with Meg Ryan in the English flick\". The film emerged as a \"super-hit\" commercially and fetched Kajol a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare that year. However, her biggest success that year was her final release, Karan Johar's directorial debut, the romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Co-starring Shah Rukh Khan, her cousin Rani Mukerji and Salman Khan, the film emerged as an all-time blockbuster in both India and overseas with a worldwide gross of \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million). Kajol played Anjali Sharma, an unattractive fun-loving tomboy, who later transforms into a feminine and beautiful girl, and is secretly in love with her best friend, played by Shah Rukh Khan. A review carried by The Times of India wrote, \"Kajol is almost mesmeric as Anjali, the firebrand youngster who doesn't know whether she should settle for best girl or basketball buddy. [...] Kajol with her baggy apparel, her bouncy bob cut and her boyish banter is absolutely riveting.\" She eventually won her second Best Actress award at the 44th Filmfare Awards ceremony and first Zee Cine Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film. Filmfare included Kajol's work in both Dushman and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in their listing of Indian cinema's \"80 Most Iconic performances\". In 1999, post her marriage with Ajay Devgn, Kajol featured in a supporting role alongside him and Mahima Chaudhry in Prakash Jha's drama Dil Kya Kare. She played Nandita Rai, the other woman in the life of Anant Kishore, played by Devgn. In an interview with Filmfare she explained, \"The only reason, I agreed to play my character was because it had shades of grey. I would have probably refused the wife's role. Because I felt it had nothing for me to do.\" Upon release, the film met with largely negative reviews. Critic Sharmila Taliculam, however, described Kajol as \"the only person who gives her role a semblance of sanity\". Commercially too, the film failed to do well. However, her next release, Satish Kaushik's woman's film, the drama Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain, emerged as a critical and commercial success. Starring alongside Anil Kapoor, Kajol received another Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare ceremony for her portrayal of Megha, the deceived wife of Kapoor's character. The film met with wide media coverage for being one of the few woman-centered films to emerge as a commercial success in India. Kajol's third and final release of 1999 was the critically and commercially unsuccessful romantic drama Hote Hote Pyar Ho Gaya, alongside Jackie Shroff, Atul Agnihotri and Ayesha Jhulka. The following year, she featured alongside her husband once again, in his home-production Raju Chacha. The children's film, with a production cost of \u20b9300 million (US$4.6\u00a0million) was described as the \"most expensive Bollywood film ever\", at the time. Upon release, the film met with negative reviews and flopped at the box-office. Kajol's first release of 2001 was Rahul Rawail's comedy film Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi, where she played the double role of Tina and Sweety Khanna, twin sisters who are separated at birth. The film was a major commercial failure and fetched negative reviews from critics. Writing for Rediff.com, Savera R Someshwar criticised Kajol's decision to star in the film; termed her as a \"glamorous prop\" and described her performance as \"uninspiring\". Later that year, she played a leading role in Karan Johar's family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., which was a blockbuster in India and the top-grossing Indian production of all-time in the overseas market until 2006. Also featuring Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor in prominent roles, Kajol played the role of Anjali Sharma, a young Punjabi woman from Delhi's Chandni Chowk area, who falls for the rich Rahul Raichand, played by Khan. Kajol, faced initial difficulties while filming for her scenes, as she was required to speak in Punjabi, a language she wasn't fluent in. However, she learnt the right pronunciation and diction with the help of producer, Yash Johar and the crew members. Her comic-dramatic performance met with unanimous critical acclaim and won her several awards, including her third Filmfare Award and her second Screen Award in the Best Actress category. Taran Adarsh labelled her as \"first-rate\" and predicted that her \"Punjabi dialect will win her immense praise\". The Hindu wrote, \"Kajol ... steals the thunder from under very high noses indeed. With her precise timing and subtle lingering expression, she is a delight all the way.\" Following the success of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., Kajol took a sabbatical from full-time acting. In an interview with The Times of India she revealed, \"I'm not quitting films, I'm just being selective. Fortunately, I'm in a position where I can pick and choose.\" She added that the reason behind the break was to concentrate on her marriage and \"start a family\". Kajol returned to films in 2006 with Kunal Kohli's romantic thriller Fanaa, opposite Aamir Khan. She, however, refused to term Fanaa as her \"comeback film\" because, \"I never retired. I had just taken a break\". The film emerged as a major box-office success with a worldwide gross of \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million). She portrayed the role of Zooni Ali Beg, a blind Kashmiri girl who unwittingly falls in love with a terrorist, played by Khan. Both the film as well as Kajol's performance were well received, with reviewer Sudish Kamat calling her the \"only reason to watch the film\" and adding, \"Kajol performs like she never took a break from celluloid and peps up the film with her presence.\" A review carried by Bloomberg noted, \"[Kajol] still has the ability to light up the screen with ease, making her one of the few leading ladies who can more than match Khan's method-driven prowess.\" Her work in Fanaa fetched Kajol a fourth Filmfare Award and second Zee Cine Award in Best Actress category. After the success of Fanaa, Kajol worked intermittently through the rest of the decade. She next starred in her husband's directorial debut, the drama U Me Aur Hum (2008) as Piya, a woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Devgn described Kajol's participation in the project by saying, \"She is always thorough with the nitty-gritties of her character before she begins shooting. Since the screenplay work happened at home, Kajol was present for all the sittings and even gave her inputs.\" Upon release, the film performed moderately well at the box-office and earned positive critical reviews for her performance. Udita Jhunjhunwala noted, \"Kajol completely comes into her own here as an ailing woman unaware of her vulnerability and delicate situation. She is superb.\" Raja Sen added, \"[Kajol] can span through happy-breezy with her eyes closed, and so the first half doesn't even pose her a challenge, but when Alzheimer's strikes Piya and she begins to forget all that matters in her life, Kajol raises the bar strikingly high.\" The following year, Kajol received another Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards ceremony. Kajol was next cast opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Karan Johar's My Name Is Khan, a counter-terrorism drama based on the ethnic profiling and discrimination faced by American Muslims post the 9/11 terrorist attacks My Name Is Khan released in February 2010 to highly positive reviews and emerged as an international success with a worldwide gross of \u20b92 billion (US$31\u00a0million). Kajol's portrayal of Mandira, a divorced, Hindu single mother who marries a Muslim autistic man was praised by critics, with Rajeev Masand observing, \"Bringing emotional depth to what is essentially Rizwan's story, Kajol is immensely likeable as Mandira, using her eyes to convey volumes, topping the performance off with a powerful breakdown scene that literally puts her through the wringer.\" Kajol won her fifth Best Actress award at the Filmfare for the film, thereby sharing the record for the most Best Actress wins with her late aunt, Nutan. She next starred alongside Kareena Kapoor and Arjun Rampal in Siddharth Malhotra's moderately successful family drama We Are Family, an official adaptation of the Hollywood tearjerker Stepmom (1998). Kajol played the role of Maya, a character originally played by Susan Sarandon, and which she described as \"a control freak\", believing it \"is something which every woman would identify with.\" While reviewing the film for Hindustan Times, critic Mayank Shekhar stated, \"The premise is stuff dry tissues are made for. Yet, the pathos here is produced not from moments, but from performances alone: a stunning Kajol's in particular. She appears superior to Susan Sarandon, I suspect.\" New York Times's Rachel Saltz wrote, \"The always appealing Kajol knows how to play melodrama without being melodramatic, and her naturalism gives the movie a genuine emotional kick.\" Her final release of the year was Toonpur Ka Super Hero, a live-action animated film, opposite Ajay Devgn. In an interview with The Express Tribune, Kajol mentioned that it was difficult to work on the film. She added, \"Dubbing and shooting was equally frustrating. You had to keep so many things in mind and there were a few action sequences too where I had to do action in front of a green space, so I was smiling, scowling, laughing\u00a0\u2013 all in the wrong places!\" The film was a critical and commercial failure and fetched Kajol mostly negative reviews for playing a role that provided her with \"no scope\" to perform. After another five-year absence from the screen, Kajol starred with Shah Rukh Khan for the seventh time (alongside Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon) in Rohit Shetty's comedy-drama Dilwale (2015). She portrayed Meera Dev Malik, the daughter of a mafia don who falls in love with a man from her rival family. Reviewers were generally negative about the film, however, Kajol's performance received a mixed-to-positive reception. Suhani Singh of India Today wrote: \"Kajol is a radiant presence on the screen and delivers what's expected out of her \u2013 which is not much.\" Dilwale emerged as a major commercial success at the box office, grossing more than \u20b9394 crore (US$61\u00a0million) worldwide, and rank among one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time. Kajol performance in the film garnered her Best Actress nominations at various award ceremonies, including Filmfare and Screen. As of October 2016, Kajol has committed to star in director Anand Gandhi's next untitled film, that will be produced by Ajay Devgn. She has also committed to star in Velaiilla Pattadhari 2, which marks her return to Tamil films after she was last seen in Minsaara Kanavu. In 1999, following the launch of Ajay Devgn's production company, Devgan Films (now renamed Devgn Entertainment and Software Ltd), Kajol worked towards building a website for the company. In 2000, she launched an online portal, Cineexplore for the production company. She explained, \"The portal takes into account every aspect of film-making. My role is that of a supervisor. I just have to overlook the proceedings. We have our hands in everything. We are making software for TV and music videos.\" She, however, clarified that she wasn't involved in the production aspect of the company, but participated in supervising and \"overseeing everything\". She was named a part-time member of Prasar Bharati in 2016. In 1998, Kajol participated in a concert tour entitled Awesome Foursome alongside Shahrukh Khan, Juhi Chawla, and Akshay Kumar. After travelling across United Kingdom, Canada and the United States of America, Kajol refused to participate in any more world tours, as she couldn't handle \"the stress\". In 2008, Kajol featured as a talent judge, alongside her husband, Ajay Devgn and mother, Tanuja, in Zee TV's family reality show, Rock-N-Roll Family. She described her experience of working in television by saying, \"Working on television is much, much tougher than films. But television has a great connect with a live audience which is a refreshing change for us actors.\" Kajol has been actively involved in several philanthropic endeavours related to women and children. According to her, \"every child deserves education\", as \"education is the basis of society\". In 2008, she was awarded with the Karmaveer Puraskaar, for her contribution in the field of social service. Kajol is involved with Shiksha, an NGO that works in the field of children's education. In 2009, she launched the Shiksha 2009 campaign, to support the cause. In 2011, Kajol participated in a fashion show organised by the Cancer Patients Aid Association, to generate funds for the organisation. Kajol is the international goodwill ambassador and patron of The Loomba Trust\u00a0\u2014 a charity organisation devoted to supporting widows and their children around the world, particularly in India. Speaking about the issue, she said: \"It's sad to know that widows are still considered a blight in our society. There are widows who are still not marriageable. I strongly feel for them and take it as a social responsibility to eradicate the issue.\" In 2012, Kajol was appointed as the brand ambassador of Pratham, a charity organisation for children. In April, she featured in a short film about education and literacy, with the children of Hanuman Basti Primary School in Mumbai, for the organisation. Kajol began dating fellow actor, Ajay Devgn, in 1994, while filming for Gundaraj. Members of the media, however, labelled them as an \"unlikely pair\" due to their contrasting personalities. Devgn explained their relationship by saying, \"We never resorted to the usual 'I Love you' routine. A proposal never happened. We grew with each other. Marriage was never discussed, but it was always imminent\". They subsequently got married on 24 February 1999 in a traditional Maharashtrian style ceremony at the Devgan house. The wedding was subject to wide media scrutiny, as certain members of the media criticised Kajol's decision to settle down at the \"peak of her career\". Kajol, however, maintained that she would not quit films, but would cut down on the amount of work that she did. Following her marriage, Kajol moved in with Devgn and his parents at the latter's ancestral house in Juhu. While media members speculated about a lack of compatibility between her in-laws and her, Kajol clarified that they were \"like parents to me\" and encouraged her to continue working in films. Tabloids have often romantically linked Devgn with other Bollywood actresses, and have reported about an imminent divorce. Refuting the rumours, Kajol stated, \"I don't believe in those rumours because I know the way this industry functions. [...] You cannot continue a marriage without the basic trust. Frankly, I don't care for such talk.\" In 2001, Kajol was pregnant with her first child. However, due to an ectopic pregnancy, she suffered from a miscarriage. On 20 April 2003, Kajol gave birth to a daughter, Nysa. Seven years later, on 13 September 2010, she gave birth to a son, Yug. She described motherhood as \"fab\" and added that her kids brought out \"the best in her\". Film critic Sukanya Verma has described Kajol as a \"contrasting personality\". She wrote, \"Think Kajol, think emotions. Either she is the firebrand or the emotional sensitive types. [And sometimes] she is pure, wicked fun.\" Initially termed by journalists as \"an impulsive and impetuous brat\", Kajol has defied the stereotypical image of a Hindi film heroine in several ways. Journalist Kaveree Bamzai elaborated, \"She hardly looks into the mirror, barely even glances at the set monitor, usually the crutch of every insecure actor, puts on make-up only under extreme duress, and [...] never watches her old movies.\" Kajol has often been criticised in the media for \"her lack of interest in maintaining her appearance by means of slimming, grooming, jewellery or fashion\". Filmfare labelled her as an \"unconventional beauty\" and added, \"Not one to abide by the trending norms, Kajol set her own rules in the '90s, a time when individuality didn't work for most heroines.\". After portraying leading roles in a series of family dramas, Kajol showed versatility as an actress with Gupt, and was subsequently noted in the media for her unconventional approach in selecting projects. Her acting style has been described as being \"natural\". According to the The Hindu, \"What Kajol abounds in is talent and a felicity for expression. Kajol does not act out her scenes and deliver her lines; she inhabits her characters.\" Furthermore, unlike most of her contemporaries, Kajol has had a successful career post-marriage and motherhood. Certain members of the media, however, attribute her success to her friendship with Karan Johar, Aditya Chopra and Shahrukh Khan, who \"still find central roles for her in their movies\". Kajol featured in Box Office India's Top Actresses list for five consecutive years (1995\u201399). In 2001 and 2006, following the commercial success of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... and Fanaa, respectively, Kajol featured in Rediff's annual Top Bollywood actresses listing.  In 2007, Kajol occupied the ninth spot in Rediff's listing of the Best Bollywood Actresses. Ever. In 2011, the Government of India honoured her with the Padma Shri for her contribution to Indian Cinema. In 2006, Kajol was one of the four Bollywood actors, alongside Priyanka Chopra, Hrithik Roshan and Shahrukh Khan, whose miniature dolls were launched in the United Kingdom, under the name of \"Bollywood Legends\". In 2010, Kajol and her My Name is Khan co-star, Shahrukh Khan, became the first Indian actors to be invited by NASDAQ to open the American stock exchange. In 2012, Kajol was placed at the fourth position by NDTV in the listing of \"The most popular actresses of all time\", behind actresses Madhuri Dixit, Sridevi and Meena Kumari. The same year, she was featured by Yahoo.com as one of the ten most iconic beauties of Hindi cinema. Kajol has received six Filmfare Awards, including five Best Actress awards for Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Fanaa (2006) and My Name Is Khan (2010), and a Best Villain award (also known as Filmfare Award for Best Performance In a Negative Role) for Gupt: The Hidden Truth (1997). In 2011, she was awarded Padma Shri, the fourth-highest Indian civilian award, by the Government of India for her contributions to the arts."

After a seven-year hiatus from films, Kamal returned to the industry as a dance assistant, apprenticing under dance choreographer Thankappan. During this time, Kamal made brief appearances in some films including a few uncredited roles. His first appearance came in the 1970 film Maanavan, in which he appeared in a dance sequence.

Vishwanath in Swathi Muthyam, playing an autistic person who tries to change society; it was India's entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards in 1986. These Tollywood films found him a large audience in Andhra Pradesh, and many of his later Tamil films were dubbed into Telugu. Following Punnagai Mannan (in which he played two roles, including a satire of Charlie Chaplin as Chaplin Chellappa) and Kadhal Parisu, Kamal appeared in Mani Ratnam's 1987 film Nayakan. He received his second Indian National Award for his performance; Nayakan (inspired from Hollywood movie The Godfather ) was submitted by India as its entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 1987 Academy Awards, and is on the Time's All-Time 100 Movies list. In 1988 Kamal appeared in his only silent film to date: Pushpak, a black comedy, Unnal Mudiyum Thambi (a remake of the Telugu film Rudraveena) and Sathya (remake of Hindi film Arjun) in 1988.

By the end of the 1980s Kamal was successful in the Malayalam, Kannada, Telugu and Hindi film industries, with Filmfare Awards in each industry and two national awards. In 1990, Michael Madhana Kamarajan saw Kamal build on Apoorva Sagodharargal by playing quadruplets. It began as a collaboration with writer Crazy Mohan for future comedy films. Kamal won successive Best Actor awards for his portrayal of deranged, obsessive protagonists in Gunaa and Thevar Magan (which was remade in Hindi as 1997's Virasat). He was credited with the story for the latter, and won his third National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil as a producer. The film was India's submission for the Academy Awards that year. A series of films followed: Singaravelan, Maharasan, Kalaignan, Mahanadi, Nammavar, and Sathi Leelavathi (based on the British film She-Devil).

'The Week' , in its 13 September 1992 edition, reported that Chiranjeevi charged Rs.1.25 crores per a film and which is the highest ever remuneration for any Indian hero then.

After Indian Kamal played a woman in the comedy Avvai Shanmughi (inspired by Mrs. Doubtfire), which was a box-office success. He chose Shantanu Sheorey to direct the Hindi remake of Avvai Shanmughi, Chachi 420, but after dissatisfaction with five days of shooting Kamal took over as director. In 1997 Kamal began directing an unfinished biopic of Mohammed Yusuf Khan, Marudhanayagam; a forty five minutes of film and a trailer was shot. Marudhanayagam was expected to be the biggest, most expensive film in Indian cinematic history and his magnum opus; a number of well-known actors and technicians had been signed, and it was launched at a public ceremony by Queen Elizabeth during her 1997 visit to India. Although the film failed to materialise due to budget constraints, Kamal expressed an interest in reviving the project. In 1998, he appeared in Singeetham Srinivasa Rao's romantic comedy, Kaathala Kaathala opposite Prabhu Deva. The film was a commercial success and was also dubbed in Hindi as Mirch Masala, which was never released. After a two-year hiatus from Indian cinema, Kamal decided against reviving Marudhanayagam. He directed his second film, Hey Ram, a period drama, told in flashback, with a fact-based plot centering on the partition of India and the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. Kamal produced and choreographed the film, writing its screenplay and lyrics; it was India's submission for the Academy Awards that year.

Sambandam and Panchathantiram (inspired from the Hollywood movie Very Bad Things) and guest appearances, Kamal directed Virumaandi, a film about capital punishment which won the Best Asian Film Award at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival. He also appeared in Anbe Sivam with Madhavan. Priyadarshan, its original director, left and Sundar C. completed the film. Anbe Sivam tells the story of Nallasivam, portrayed by Kamal as a communist. His performance was praised by critics, with The Hindu saying that he \"has once again done Tamil cinema proud\". In 2004 Kamal appeared in Vasool Raja MBBS, a remake of Bollywood's Munnabhai MBBS, with Sneha which was a box-office success. The following year, he wrote and starred in the comedy Mumbai Express. Released during Tamil New Year with Rajinikanth's Chandramukhi and Vijay's romantic comedy Sachien, it was a disappointment at the box office despite positive reviews. In 2006 Kamal's long-delayed project, the stylish police story Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu, was a success. Directed by Gautham Menon, the film is about a police officer sent to the US to investigate a series of medical murders. In 2008's Dasavathaaram, he played ten roles; the film was released in a number of languages (including Tamil, Telugu and Hindi) throughout India and overseas. Dasavathaaram, written by Kamal and director K. S. Ravikumar, is one of the first modern science-fiction films made in India. Starring Kamal and Asin Thottumkal, it was the highest-grossing Tamil film (as of 2008[update]) and his performance was critically praised. In Canada, Dasavathaaram was the first Tamil film distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. After Dasavathaaram Kamal directed a film tentatively titled Marmayogi, which stalled after a year of pre-production. He then produced and starred in Unnaipol Oruvan, a remake of the Bollywood film A Wednesday, where he reprised the role originally played by Naseeruddin Shah with Malayalam actor Mohanlal playing Anupam Kher's role. It was released in Telugu as Eeenadu, with Venkatesh reprising the role played by Kher. Both versions were critically acclaimed and commercially successful. Kamal collaborated for the fifth time with Ravikumar in Manmadan Ambu, for which he also wrote the screenplay. The story concerns a man who hires a detective to find out if his fianc\u00e9e is cheating on him. The film was released in December 2010 to mixed reviews, with Behindwoods calling it \"an entertainer, but in parts\" and Sify saying it \"lacks the punch to captivate the audiences\". Kamal's next film after Manmadhan Ambu was 2013's Vishwaroopam, released in Hindi as Vishwaroop. It won two National Film Awards (Best Production Design and Best Choreography) at the 60th National Film Awards. In May 2014, he was appointed as the official Indian delegate to the 67th Cannes Film Festival. As of July 2014, he was working on three films: Uthama Villain, Vishwaroopam II, the sequel of Vishwaroopam and Papanasam.

Kamal's production company (Rajkamal International) has produced several of his films, and he directed Chachi 420, Hey Ram, Virumaandi and Vishwaroopam. He considered directing full-time if Hey Ram was successful, but changed his mind when the film failed at the box office. In his earlier career, he has also choreographed for MGR in Naan Yen Pirandhen, Sivaji Ganesan in Savaale Samaali and Jayalalithaa in Anbu Thangai In 2010 Kamal said he wanted to do more directing, since young actors wished to work for him. When he played supporting roles early in his career he wanted to become a technician, and joked: \"Film makers like K. Balachander told me that I won't be able make much money by being a technician. So the end result is that the star Kamal funds the technician Kamal in pursuing his dreams\". Kamal attended workshops for makeup technicians in the US for several years, and trained as a makeup artist under Michael Westmore. Kamal has also written songs for his films. He wrote the lyrics for a single in Hey Ram, songs in Virumaandi and Unnaipol Oruvan and the album for Manmadhan Ambu. Kamal's musical work has been well received by his peers in Tamil film. He is also a playback singer, singing in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam and English. Currently Kamal is part of the Mission \"Clean India\" set by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Kamal was born into a Tamil family in the town of Paramakudi, in the Ramanathapuram district of Tamil Nadu, to criminal defense lawyer D. Srinivasan and Rajalakshmi a housewife. During a 2013 appearance on an episode of Neengalum Vellalam Oru Kodi, he stated that his parents originally named him Parthasarathy and his mother always used to call him by that name. In an interview with Karan Thapar, Kamal said his father was literate in Sanskrit. Kamal was the youngest of four children; his siblings are Charuhasan, Chandrahasan and Nalini (Raghu). His two older brothers followed their father's example and studied law. Kamal has alluded to his parents in some of his works, notably Unnaipol Oruvan and in the song \"Kallai Mattum\" in Dasavathaaram. His oldest brother Charuhasan, like Kamal, is a National Film Award-winning actor who appeared in the Kannada film Tabarana Kathe. Charuhasan's daughter Suhasini is also a National Film Award winner married to director (and fellow award-winner) Mani Ratnam, who collaborated with Kamal on 1987's Nayakan. Chandrahasan has produced several of Kamal's films and was an executive with Rajkamal International, he died in March 2017. Chandrahasan's daughter Anu Hasan has had supporting roles in several films, including Suhasini's Indira. Kamal's sister, Nalini Raghu, is a dance teacher for whom he named an auditorium (Nalini Mahal). Her son, Gautham, played Kamal's grandson in \"Hey Ram\". Early in his career, he co-starred in several films with Srividya. They were reported to have had an affair during the 1970s and their relationship was explored in the 2008 Malayalam film Thirakkatha by Renjith (with Anoop Menon as Kamal and Priyamani as Srividya). Kamal visited Srividya when she was on her deathbed in 2006. In 1978, at age 24, Kamal married dancer Vani Ganapathy. They divorced ten years later. Kamal and the actress Sarika began living together in 1988, marrying after the birth of their first child, Shruti Haasan (born 1986). Shruti Haasan is a singer and a Tollywood-Kollywood actress. Their younger daughter, Akshara (born 1991), was assistant director for 2013's Vishwaroopam. Sarika stopped acting soon after their marriage, replacing Vani Ganapathy as Kamal's costume designer for Hey Ram. In 2002, the couple filed for divorce, which became final in 2004. Kamal's affair with co-star Simran Bagga (22 years younger than him) triggered the breakup. His relationship with Simran (who appeared in Pammal K. Sambandam and Panchathantiram) was brief, since Simran married her childhood friend in late 2003. Kamal had lived with former actress Gautami Tadimalla (who had starred with him in several films during the late 1980s and early 1990s) from 2005 till 2016. Gautami had announced on her blog that she had ended her relationship with him. Gautami wrote on her blog: \"It is heartbreaking for me to have to say today that I and Mr. Haasan are no longer together. After almost 13 years together, it has been one of the most devastating decisions that I have ever had to make in my life,\". Shruti, Akshara and Gautami's daughter Subbalakshmi (from an annulled marriage) lived with them. Kamal is a self-proclaimed atheist. He has often questioned the existence of God and has highlighted the theme in his films like Anbe Sivam and Dasavathaaram. He has been thought to be Muslim because of his Arabic-sounding name, most notably when he was denied preclearance by U.S. Customs and Border Protection authorities at Toronto Pearson International Airport in 2002. In Sanskrit Kamal means \"lotus\", but it was rumoured that his name originated with a friend of his father (Yaakob Hassan, a Muslim freedom fighter who was imprisoned along with Kamal's father by the British). In a BBC interview with Karan Thapar, Kamal said that his last name derives from the Sanskrit word hasya, and although the Yaakob Hassan connection was publicised by the media it was only \"a story\". Although he has abstained from politics, Kamal is considered left-leaning or independent. and has said that his politics would result in his death within a year. Kamal is the first Tamil actor to convert his fan clubs into welfare organisations and is involved in social-service activities through the clubs under the name Kamal Narpani Iyakkam (Kamal Welfare Association). His fan clubs help organise blood- and eye-donation drives, and donate educational materials to students. Kamal received the first Abraham Kovoor National Award for his humanist activities and secular life in 2004. He was project ambassador for Hridayaragam 2010, which raised funds for an orphanage for HIV/AIDS-affected children. In September 2010 Kamal launched a children's cancer relief fund and gave roses to children with cancer at Sri Ramachandra University in Porur, Chennai. He has pledged his product-endorsement income to social causes. Kamal won \u20b9\u00a05\u00a0million on Neengalum Vellalam Oru Kodi in March 2013 and promised that his prize money would be used for Petral Thaan Pillaya, supporting children with HIV. Kamal was nominated by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Swachh Bharat Campaign. He chose to clean the Madambakkam lake in Chennai with the Environmentalist Foundation of India's Arun Krishnamurthy on 7 November 2014. Known for refusing any kind of brand endorsement, Kamal endorsed Pothys for the first time in 2015. His daughter, Shruti Haasan has previously endorsed Pothys.

His views on cinema, child and drug abuse, and the Kashmir conflict have been published as Thedi Theerpom Va (Come, Let's Find and Solve) by his fan club. He is also interested in Tamil literature. Kamal received in 1990 the Padma Shri and in 2014 the Padma Bhushan for his contributions to Indian cinema. At age six he won the President's Gold Medal for Best Child Actor for his debut film, Kalathur Kannamma. He is tied with Mammootty for the second most Best Actor National Film Awards with three. He won a National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil for producing the 1992 Tamil film, Thevar Magan. He has a record 19 Filmfare Awards in five languages; after his last award, in 2000, he wrote to the organisation requesting no further awards. In 2003, his films Hey Ram, Pushpak, Nayakan and Kuruthipunal were showcased in the \"Director in Focus\" category at the Rotterdam Film Festival. In 2004, Virumaandi won the inaugural Best Asian film award at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival (PiFan). In 2005, Sathyabama Deemed University awarded Kamal an honorary doctorate. He received the Chevalier Sivaji Ganesan Award for Excellence in Indian Cinema at the inaugural Vijay Awards in 2006. He received the Living Legend Award in 2007 from FICCI. In 2010, the United Progressive Alliance government organised a retrospective of his films. Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni said the actor was unique, since his films broke regional and language barriers. That year, the government of Kerala honoured him for 50 years in Indian cinema during statewide Onam celebrations in Thiruvananthapuram. Kamal received the Kalaimamani Award from the government of Tamil Nadu in 1979. Other honours include Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, Nandi, Screen and Vijay Awards, including four awards for his performance in Dasavathaaram. In 2009 he was appointed chairman of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) Media and Entertainment Business Conclave, organised by FICCI's entertainment division. He is on the academic advisory council for ISFM (International school of Film+Media), and was the first Indian actor invited aboard an American ship as a special friend of the US. In April 2013 he received an award on behalf of Indian cinema from Chris Brown, executive vice-president for conventions and business operations of the National Association of Broadcasters, as part of the New York Festivals International Film & TV Awards. He is one of 20 film celebrities recognised by Coca-Cola India with the launch of the 24th edition of the Limca Book of Records in 2013. Recently honoured with S. S. Vasan Award for his life time achievement in film industry by Ananda Vikatan. Mani Ratnam, who directed Kamal in Nayakan, has said that there are many things he can do that no other actor can. Veteran Tamil actor Nagesh called Kamal the best actor he had ever seen. Kamal's contributions to film have been praised by his peers in the Indian film industry, including Sridevi, Meena, Amitabh Bachchan, Mohanlal, Venkatesh, Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan. Younger actors (Suriya and Madhavan) and filmmakers (Bala, Ameer and Gautham Menon) have been inspired by him. The animated action sequence in Quentin Tarantino's 2003 film, Kill Bill, was inspired by 2D animated sequences in an Indian film believed to be Aalavandhan. Hollywood filmmaker Barrie M. Osburne called Kamal's knowledge of literature, history and films \"encyclopedic\", and Ang Lee said he was stunned by his brilliance and knowledge of films. Kamal Hassan has been alleged of plagiarism and inspiration from Hollywood films. He was criticised by the-then Tamil Nadu Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam; the latter stated that Kamal was \"confused\" and had \"blabbered\" unaware of the ground reality for his statement on the government's response to rain relief efforts. Kamal was also criticised by Nayakan's producer Muktha Srinivasan for his article in The Hindu taking unnecessary credit for that film. He was condemned by the BJP Politician H Raja for his statements on god believers. Kamal has been accused of self-indulgence, and has been criticised for sexually explicit scenes and themes, offensive religious sentiments and superficiality about the social issues depicted in his films. There have also been complaints about his obsession with perfection, which may have caused some of his films to run over budget."

        "artist_name": "Kangana_Ranaut", 
        "biography": " Kangana Ranaut (pronounced\u00a0[k\u0259\u014b\u0261\u0259na\u02d0 ra\u02d0\u0273o\u02d0\u0288\u02b0]; born 23 March 1986) is an Indian film actress. She has established a career in Bollywood and is one of the highest-paid actresses in India. Ranaut is particularly known in the media for expressing her honest opinions in public and is frequently credited as one of the most fashionable Indian celebrities. She is the recipient of several awards, including three National Film Awards and Filmfare Awards in four categories. Born in Bhambla, a small town in Himachal Pradesh, Ranaut initially aspired to become a doctor at the insistence of her parents. Determined to build her own career path, she relocated to Delhi at age sixteen, where she briefly became a model. After training under the theatre director Arvind Gaur, Ranaut made her feature film debut in the 2006 thriller Gangster, for which she was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. She received praise for portraying emotionally intense characters in the dramas Woh Lamhe (2006), Life in a... Metro (2007) and Fashion (2008). For the last of these, she won the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress and a Filmfare Award in the same category. Ranaut featured in the commercially successful films Raaz: The Mystery Continues (2009) and Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai (2010), though she was criticised for being typecast in neurotic roles. A comic role opposite R. Madhavan in the 2011 box office hit Tanu Weds Manu was well-received, though this was followed by a series of brief, glamorous roles in films that failed to propel her career forward. She then played a mutant opposite Hrithik Roshan in the science fiction film Krrish 3 (2013), one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films, and won the Filmfare and National Film Award for Best Actress for her performance in the comedy-drama Queen (2014). In 2015, Ranaut portrayed a dual role in Tanu Weds Manu Returns, the most successful Bollywood film featuring a female protagonist, for which she won a Filmfare Critics Award and a second consecutive National Film Award for Best Actress.   Ranaut was born on 23 March 1986 at Bhambla (now Surajpur), a small town in the Mandi district of Himachal Pradesh, into a Rajput family. Her mother, Asha Ranaut, is a school teacher, and her father, Amardeep Ranaut, is a businessman. She has an elder sister, Rangoli, who as of 2014 works as her manager and a younger brother, Akshat. Her great-grandfather, Sarju Singh Ranaut, was a Member of the Legislative Assembly and her grandfather was an officer for the Indian Administrative Service. She grew up in a joint family at their ancestral haveli (mansion) in Bhambla, and described her childhood as \"simple and happy\". According to Ranaut, she was \"stubborn and rebellious\" while growing up: \"If my father would gift my brother a plastic gun and get a doll for me, I would not accept that. I questioned the discrimination.\" She did not subscribe to the stereotypes that were expected of her and experimented with fashion from a young age, often pairing up accessories and clothes that would seem \"bizarre\" to her neighbours. Ranaut was educated at the DAV School in Chandigarh, where she pursued science as her core subject, remarking that she was \"very studious\" and \"always paranoid about [...] results\". She initially intended to become a doctor on the insistence of her parents. However, a failed unit test in chemistry during her twelfth grade led Ranaut to reconsider her career prospects and despite preparing for the All India Pre Medical Test, she did not turn up for the exam. Determined to find her \"space and freedom\", she relocated to Delhi at the age of sixteen. Her decision not to pursue medicine led to constant feuding with her parents and her father refused to sponsor a pursuit he considered to be aimless. In Delhi, Ranaut was unsure which career to choose; the Elite Modelling Agency were impressed by her looks and suggested that she model for them. She took on a few modelling assignments, but generally disliked the career as she found \"no scope for creativity\". Ranaut decided to shift focus towards acting and joined the Asmita Theatre Group, where she trained under the theatre director Arvind Gaur. She participated in Gaur's theatre workshop at the India Habitat Centre, acting in several of his plays, including the Girish Karnad-scripted Taledanda. During a performance, when one of the male actors went missing, Ranaut played his part along with her original role of a woman. A positive reaction from the audience prompted her to relocate to Mumbai to pursue a career in film and she enrolled herself for a four-month acting course in Asha Chandra's drama school. Ranaut struggled with her meager earnings during this period, eating only \"bread and aachar (pickle)\". Refusing her father's financial assistance led to a rift in their relationship which she later regretted. Her relatives were unhappy with her decision to enter the film-making industry, and they did not correspond with her for several years. She reconciled with them after the release of Life in a... Metro in 2007. In 2004, the producers Ramesh Sharma and Pahlaj Nilani announced that Ranaut would make her film debut with the Deepak Shivdasani-directed I Love You Boss. The following year, an agent took her to the office of the producer Mahesh Bhatt, where she interacted with the director Anurag Basu and auditioned for the lead role in the romantic thriller Gangster. Bhatt felt that she was too young for the role and signed Chitrangada Singh instead. However, Singh was later unavailable to do the film and Ranaut was contracted as a replacement for Gangster, opting out of I Love You Boss. She was cast in the central role of Simran, an alcoholic woman caught in a romantic triangle between a notorious gangster (played by Shiney Ahuja) and a sympathetic friend (played by Emraan Hashmi). Ranaut was only seventeen while filming and said that she \"had difficulty first in understanding and then unwinding from the character\", describing her craft as \"raw and immature\". Released in 2006, Gangster emerged as a critical and commercial success and her performance was praised. Raja Sen of Rediff.com said that \"Kangana is a remarkable find, the actress coming across with great conviction. Hers is the pivotal character and an extremely difficult role to essay, but she manages it well [...] Kangana's nuances [of an alcoholic character] are disconcertingly realistic.\" She won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut, along with various other debut awards. Ranaut's next role was in the Mohit Suri-directed drama Woh Lamhe (2006), a semi-biographical film based on the schizophrenic actress Parveen Babi and her relationship with the director Mahesh Bhatt. She said that portraying Babi had left her emotionally drained, as she had begun to \"feel her desolation and loneliness.\" Film critic Subhash K. Jha wrote that Ranaut \"is the first female performer of Bollywood since Smita and Shabana who isn't scared to strip her soul naked for the camera\", adding that she is a \"hugely expressive actress with a phenomenal ability to convey torment, hurt and incredulity through the eyes\". Despite positive reviews, the film underperformed at the box office. The following year, Ranaut portrayed an aspiring musician in Suneel Darshan's musical thriller Shakalaka Boom Boom, alongside Bobby Deol, Upen Patel and Celina Jaitly. The film's production was marred by a dispute between Ranaut and Darshan; she objected to her voice being dubbed by another artist, but he insisted that he needed a particular \"twang and accent\" for her character. India Today described the film as an \"amateur mess\" and the film proved to be a box office flop. She next reunited with Anurag Basu for the ensemble drama Life in a... Metro, playing the supporting role of Neha, a shrewd socialite engaged in an affair with her married boss (played by Kay Kay Menon). Despite a poor initial run at the box office, the film emerged as a profitable venture. Khalid Mohamed of Hindustan Times was critical of the film, noting its lack of originality and realism. In a more positive review, Raja Sen wrote that Ranaut \"is refreshing [...] and manages to herd her emotions well, playing a complex role but hardly ever overreaching\", but criticised her delivery of English lines. For her role, Ranaut was awarded the Stardust Award for Breakthrough Performance \u2013 Female. Ranaut next portrayed a village girl in Dhaam Dhoom (2008), a Tamil romantic thriller, opposite Jayam Ravi. Production on the film was temporarily halted when the director, Jeeva, died of cardiac arrest and the film was completed by the crew members. A review carried by Post wrote that Ranaut had \"little scope\" in a role that did not suit her. India Today described her next film, the Madhur Bhandarkar-directed drama Fashion (2008), as a \"landmark\" in her career. Set against the backdrop of the Indian fashion industry, the film co-starred Priyanka Chopra and Mugdha Godse and featured Ranaut as Shonali Gujral, a substance abusing supermodel struggling to cope with her foundering career. Because the media speculated that her role was based on the former model Geetanjali Nagpal (which both Ranaut and Bhandarkar denied), the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW), ordered a stay on the film's release, approving it only after a script narration.[a] With a worldwide revenue of 600 million Indian rupees (\u20b9), approximately US$10 million, Fashion emerged as a commercial success, and was listed by Subhash K. Jha as one of the best films of the decade with women protagonists. Ranaut's performance drew unanimous critical acclaim. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama praised her confident portrayal of the character and believed that she was the real star of the film, and Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India added that she \"does an exquisite metamorphosis from a wispy, high-strung, nervous child-woman to a stunning ramp diva.\" Ranaut's portrayal earned her several awards, including the National Film Award and Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. The supernatural horror film Raaz: The Mystery Continues from director Mohit Suri was Ranaut's first film release of 2009, in which she played a successful model who is possessed by a ghost. The film co-starred Emraan Hashmi and Adhyayan Suman and proved to be a financial success. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express noted that Ranaut was becoming stereotyped in roles that required her to be \"hysterical\", adding that she needed a \"radical change of image\". Also that year, she played the leading lady in the drama Vaada Raha and the Telugu action film Ek Niranjan, neither of which were particularly notable. In a brief role in Anurag Basu's romantic thriller Kites (2010), Ranaut portrayed the fianc\u00e9e of Hrithik Roshan's character. She said that she felt \"cheated\" after watching the film, as her role proved to be much smaller than what she had initially signed on for. She then portrayed fictional film actress Rehana in the Milan Luthria-directed gangster film Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai. Also starring Ajay Devgn, Emraan Hashmi and Prachi Desai, the film chronicles the rise and subsequent fall of an underworld don (played by Devgn) in the 1970s. Ranaut said that her character was \"a mix\" of the actress Madhubala and the gangster Haji Mastan's wife and that to prepare she observed the work of the actresses Zeenat Aman and Parveen Babi. The film was one of the most successful releases of the year and garnered positive reviews from critics. Sudish Kamath of The Hindu labelled her a \"delight\" and Mid Day's Sarita Tanwar praised her for being \"totally convincing\" in the role. After playing a television reporter in the thriller Knock Out, Ranaut actively looked for a comedy and found the role in Anees Bazmee's No Problem, but both films failed to propel her career forward. According to Bollywood Hungama, after establishing a reputation for portraying neurotic characters, Ranaut was seeking projects that would be \"less emotionally exhausting\" for her. Her first release of 2011 was Anand L. Rai's Tanu Weds Manu, a romantic comedy opposite R. Madhavan, which Ranaut considers a \"game changer\" for her. Rai stated that he cast her for the role to illustrate that the actress was capable of playing other roles and that her character in the film was unlike any of those that she had played previously. Critical reaction to the film was mixed, though Ranaut's performance was praised. Rajeev Masand wrote, \"Kangana Ranaut is a pleasant surprise in a cheery, upbeat part that we haven't seen her take on before. She rises to the challenge, only hampered occasionally by her mangled dialogue delivery.\" Ranaut received Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies, including Screen and Zee Cine. Ranaut followed the success of Tanu Weds Manu by starring in a series of brief, glamorous roles in four other films of 2011: Game, Double Dhamaal, Rascals and Miley Naa Miley Hum. With the exception of Double Dhamaal, none of these films performed well. In a review for Rascals, the critic Gaurav Malani wrote: \"Kangana Ranaut is ill at ease in comedy. She struggles to hold her own and emerges as a bimbo in her act.\" Ranaut later said that she did some of these films due to a dearth of film offers. The following year, Ranaut portrayed a supporting role opposite Ajay Devgn in Priyadarshan's action thriller Tezz, another box office flop. The director Sanjay Gupta cast Ranaut in a brief role opposite John Abraham in the crime thriller Shootout at Wadala (2013) due to her ability to stand out in a predominantly male-centric film. The Daily News and Analysis' Tushar Joshi wrote that her role was written \"to provide the sex quotient\" and critic Vinayak Chakravorty opined that she \"does not get much scope [...] beyond the steamy lovemaking grind\". Commercially, the film performed moderately well. Ranaut achieved success later in 2013 for her portrayal of Kaya, a shapeshifting mutant, in Rakesh Roshan's science fiction film Krrish 3, alongside Hrithik Roshan, Priyanka Chopra and Vivek Oberoi. When Rakesh Roshan first offered the role to her, she declined it due a disappointing prior association with him on Kites, in which Roshan had served as producer. Following Ranaut's rejection, other actresses also turned down the role. Roshan approached her again and after assuring her that the role would not be a minuscule one, Ranaut accepted the part. Critics thought that Krrish 3 was entertaining but lacking in originality, though Ranaut's performance garnered praise. The critic Sarita Tanwar of Daily News and Analysis said: \"Kangana Ranaut is delightful as an alien making the weird hair and clothes work for her. She even manages to make you feel her pain. Quite an accomplishment that!\" With global ticket sales of \u20b93 billion (US$46\u00a0million), the film emerged as one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time, becoming Ranaut's most financially profitable venture. Also that year, Ranaut played the eponymous lead in the musical drama Rajjo. The film was a critical and commercial failure and Ranaut's portrayal of a nautch girl was largely criticised. Paloma Sharma of Rediff.com commented that \"Kangana Ranaut struggles with her Mumbaiyya dialogues and is not as graceful in the dance sequences as one would have expected.\" In 2014, Ranaut established herself in Hindi cinema when she featured alongside Rajkummar Rao and Lisa Haydon in the coming-of-age dramedy Queen; she also co-wrote the dialogues with Anvita Dutt Guptan. The film tells the story of Rani, a naive girl who embarks on her honeymoon alone after her fianc\u00e9 calls off their wedding. Ranaut, who describes herself as \"independent and confident\", reflected that the role was one of the toughest she had played, as the character's personality traits contrasted with her own. The film and Ranaut's performance received unanimous acclaim from critics. Devesh Sharma of Filmfare wrote that the fact that she \"flits from one aspect of her character to another without breaking stride shows her maturity as an actor. Her efforts make you clap for Rani's small and big victories, you root for her character to come up trumps and are glad about the glorious transformation at the end.\" With a worldwide total of \u20b9970 million (US$15\u00a0million), the film also emerged as a box office hit. She won both the Filmfare Award and the National Film Award for Best Actress for the film. Ranaut followed Queen by playing an aggressive politician in the black comedy Revolver Rani and a medical intern in the political drama Ungli (both 2014). The following year, Ranaut starred in Tanu Weds Manu Returns (2015), a sequel to Tanu Weds Manu, in which she portrayed dual roles\u2014she reprised the character of Tanuja from the original and also portrayed an aspiring athlete in it. In preparation for the latter role, she interacted with students of the University of Delhi in disguise; in addition, she attended workshops to learn the Haryanvi language and trained in the sport of triple jump. The film received positive reviews from critics and Ranaut's performance was considered its prime asset. Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times praised her for perfecting the body languages and accents of the two women, and Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV wrote that she \"fleshes out this pair of distinct individuals with such energy and finesse that it becomes difficult at times to tell that it is the same actress playing the two roles\". Tanu Weds Manu Returns earned over \u20b92.4 billion (US$37\u00a0million) worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing Bollywood film featuring a female protagonist. Ranaut won a Filmfare Critics Award and a second consecutive National Film Award for Best Actress, and received an additional Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. Also in 2015, Ranaut appeared in the romantic comedies I Love NY (a production delayed since 2013) and Nikhil Advani's Katti Batti, both of which failed at the box office. The latter saw her play opposite Imran Khan as a cancer patient, a role that critic Uday Bhatia of Mint thought \"lack[ed] the sort of definition she\u2019s had in her last few roles\". After a year-long absence from the screen, Ranaut starred as Julia, a 1940s heroine and stunt-woman in Vishal Bhardwaj's epic romance Rangoon (2017), opposite Saif Ali Khan and Shahid Kapoor. Although her role was speculated to be based on the actress Fearless Nadia, Ranaut believed it to be an \"amalgamation of many characters\" from that era, and was particularly drawn towards the \"fierceness and sensuality\" she found in the part. In preparation, she learned horse-riding and sword fighting and performed her own stunts. The media reported extensively of a feud between Ranaut and Kapoor during filming, and although they denied the reports, both stars publicly commented against the other. Rangoon received mixed reviews but Ranaut's performance was picked up for praise; in a typical review, Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times labelled Ranaut as \"terrific\", believing that the \"poor script never lets Julia reach her pinnacle but [Ranaut] steals the show even with small scenes\". The film failed to find a wide audience at the box office. As of March 2017, Ranaut will star in Simran, a drama from the director Hansal Mehta, in which she will play a Gujarati immigrant in America involved in criminal activities. In addition, Ranaut is committed to star in Ketan Mehta's biopic on Rani Laxmibai. Ranaut will also be making her production and directorial debut with an English language short film entitled The Touch, dealing with the relationship between a four-year-old boy and a dog; she co-wrote the screenplay with an Australian writer and completed principal photography in America. Ranaut has stated that her initial years in the film industry were marred with difficulties as she was unprepared to be an actress. She was conscious of her poor command of the English language and struggled to \"fit in\". In a 2013 interview with Daily News and Analysis, Ranaut recollected: \"People in the industry treated me like I didn't deserve to be spoken to and I was some unwanted object. I couldn't speak English fluently and people made fun of me for that. So dealing with rejection became a part of life.\u00a0... All that has taken a toll, I guess. I find it hard to deal with praise. Today, when people say that I have made it and made it on my own, I feel like locking up myself somewhere\u00a0... It scares me.\" During the struggle, Ranaut found support in the actor Aditya Pancholi and his wife Zarina Wahab and considered them her \"family away from home\". She became embroiled in a well publicised scandal when the media speculated on the nature of her relationship with Pancholi. She declined to speak about it openly, although she made several public appearances with him. In 2007 it was reported that Ranaut had filed a police complaint against Pancholi for physically assaulting her under the influence of alcohol. The following year Pancholi confirmed the affair in an interview, saying that he had been cohabiting with Ranaut in the past and accused her of owing him \u20b92.5 million (US$39,000). In response, Ranaut's spokesperson said that \"after physically assaulting her in the middle of a road, he has no right to expect anything from her\", adding that she had \"already given \u20b95 million (US$77,000) to [him] as a goodwill gesture\". Ranaut later said that the incident had left her \"physically and mentally\" damaged. While filming Raaz: The Mystery Continues in 2008, Ranaut began a romantic relationship with co-star Adhyayan Suman. On Suman's insistence that he focus on his professional career, the couple separated the following year. From 2010 to 2012, Ranaut was involved in a long-distance romance with Nicholas Lafferty, an English doctor; she described the relationship as \"the most normal\" she ever had, but the couple split amicably as she was not ready for marriage. She has since maintained that she will never get married, and has expressed a desire to not be bound by a relationship. In 2016, Hrithik Roshan, her co-star from Krrish 3, filed a lawsuit against Ranaut accusing her of cyber stalking and harassment. Denying the charges, Ranaut filed a counter-charge against Roshan, claiming that his lawsuit was an attempt to cover-up their affair for the benefit of his divorce proceedings. Ranaut lives in Mumbai with her sister Rangoli, who was the victim of an acid attack in 2006. She makes yearly visits to her hometown of Bhambla. A practicing Hindu, Ranaut follows the teachings of the spiritual leader Swami Vivekananda and considers meditation to be \"the highest form of worshipping God\". She practices vegetarianism and was listed as \"India's hottest vegetarian\" in a poll conducted by PETA in 2013. Since 2009 Ranaut has been studying the dance form of kathak from the Nateshwar Nritya Kala Mandir. She has said that the technical process of filmmaking is of tremendous interest to her, and to better her understanding of it Ranaut enrolled in a two-month screenplay writing course at the New York Film Academy in 2014. In an interview with Filmfare she said that despite her stardom, she wants to lead a normal life: \"I don't want to lose my rights as a common person to learn and grow\". In the book Acting Smart: Your Ticket to Showbiz, Tisca Chopra describes Ranaut as a \"free-spirited, original creative\" person \"who cannot really be slotted in a particular mould\". Ranaut is particularly known for her forthrightness in expressing her opinions in public on issues ranging from film to feminism. A televised interview hosted by Anupama Chopra in which Ranaut spoke out against gender bias and nepotism in Bollywood went viral online, which led Sunaina Kumar of Tehelka to write: \"In this age of cookie-cutter heroines with stock responses, Kangana Ranaut is refreshingly real and honest.\" Analysing Ranaut's career, the journalist Parmita Uniyal, in 2014, noted that she \"loves to challenge herself with tricky roles and manages to add a different dimension to her character every time.\" A reviewer for Rediff.com described her as a \"director's actress\" who is susceptible to both \"shine and crumble under the right/wrong guidance\". Anand L Rai (the director of Tanu Weds Manu) says that Ranaut actively pursues roles in which she can \"work in her own space and not become a mere prop in the male-dominated Bollywood\". Alongside actress Vidya Balan, Ranaut has been credited for spearheading a movement that breaks stereotypes of a Hindi film heroine by playing the protagonist in films not starring a well-known male star. Following the success of Queen and Tanu Weds Manu Returns, Deccan Chronicle labelled her as \"one of the most bankable actresses in the industry\", and Daily News and Analysis reported that she had emerged as one of the highest-paid actresses in Bollywood. Ranaut is considered a sex symbol and a style icon in India. Analysing Ranaut's off-screen persona, Hindustan Times published that she was initially written off by Indian journalists due to her \"funny accent\" and the negative publicity generated by her troubled relationships; however, her defining fashion choices and her unconventional film roles eventually established her as a star. Ranaut has frequently featured in listings of the most attractive and stylish celebrities in India. She ranked among the top 10 on The Times of India's listing of the \"Most Desirable Woman\" in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015. Ranaut was featured on Verve's listing of the most powerful women of 2010 and in 2012 she was named the \"Best Dressed Personality\" by the Indian edition of People magazine. In 2013, Ranaut featured as one of the best-dressed women celebrities by Vogue India. The journalist Jagmeeta Thind Joy credits the actress for her \"quirky, almost non-Bollywood take on personal style\", adding that she \"likes to shock and awe with her choices\". She has collaborated with the fashion brand Vero Moda to launch two clothing lines for the company, named Marquee and Venice Cruise, in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Ranaut has been the recipient of three National Film Awards: Best Supporting Actress for Fashion (2008) and Best Actress for Queen (2014) and Tanu Weds Manu Returns (2015). She has also won four Filmfare Awards: Best Female Debut for Gangster (2006), Best Supporting Actress for Fashion (2008), Best Actress for Queen (2014), and Best Actress - Critics for Tanu Weds Manu Returns (2015)."

Born on 21 September 1980 in Bombay (now Mumbai), Kapoor (often informally referred to as 'Bebo') is the younger daughter of Randhir Kapoor and Babita (n\u00e9e Shivdasani); her elder sister Karisma is also an actress. She is the paternal granddaughter of actor and filmmaker Raj Kapoor, maternal granddaughter of actor Hari Shivdasani, and niece of actor Rishi Kapoor. According to Kapoor, the name \"Kareena\" was derived from the book Anna Karenina, which her mother read while she was pregnant with her. She is of Punjabi descent on her father's side, and on her mother's side she is of Sindhi and British descent. As a child, Kapoor regularly practised Hinduism with her family, but was also exposed to Christianity from her mother. Describing herself as a \"very naughty [and] spoilt child\", Kapoor's exposure to films from a young age kindled her interest in acting; she was particularly inspired by the work of actresses Nargis and Meena Kumari. Despite her family background, her father disapproved of women entering films because he believed it conflicted with the traditional maternal duties and responsibility of women in the family. This led to a conflict between her parents, and they separated. She was then raised by her mother, who worked several jobs to support her daughters until Karisma debuted as an actress in 1991. After living separately for several years, her parents reconciled in October 2007. Kapoor remarked \"My father is also an important factor in my life [...] [Al]though we did not see him often in our initial years, we are a family now.\" Kapoor attended Jamnabai Narsee School in Mumbai, followed by Welham Girls' School in Dehradun. She attended the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, though later admitted to liking the experience. According to Kapoor, she wasn't inclined towards academics though received good grades in all her classes except mathematics. After graduating from Welham she studied commerce for two years at Mithibai College in Vile Parle (Mumbai). Kapoor then registered for a three-month summer course in microcomputers at Harvard Summer School in the United States. She later developed an interest in law, and enrolled at the Government Law College, Mumbai; during this period, she developed a long-lasting passion for reading. However, after completing her first year, Kapoor decided to pursue her interest to become an actress. She began training at an acting institute in Mumbai mentored by Kishore Namit Kapoor, a member of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII). While training at the institute, Kapoor was cast as the female lead in Rakesh Roshan's Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000) opposite his son, Hrithik Roshan. Several days into the filming, however, she abandoned the project; Kapoor later explained that she had benefited by not doing the film since more prominence was given to the director's son. She debuted later that year alongside Abhishek Bachchan in J. P. Dutta's war drama Refugee. Set during the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971, the film centers on a man who illegally transports civilians back and forth across the border. Kapoor portrayed Naaz, a Bangladeshi girl who falls in love with Bachchan's character while illegally migrating to Pakistan with her family. Her performance was acclaimed by critics; Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama described her as \"a natural performer\" and noted \"the ease with which she emotes the most difficult of scenes\", while India Today reported that Kapoor belonged to a new breed of Hindi film actors that breaks away from character stereotypes. On the experience of acting in her first film, Kapoor described it as \"tough\u00a0... [but] also a great learning experience\". Refugee was a moderate box-office success in India and Kapoor's performance earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. For her second release, Kapoor was paired opposite Tusshar Kapoor in Satish Kaushik's box-office hit Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai (2001). A review in The Hindu noted that based on her first two films, she was \"definitely the actress to watch out for\". She next starred alongside Jackie Shroff and Hrithik Roshan in Subhash Ghai's flop Yaadein, followed by Abbas-Mustan's moderately successful thriller Ajnabee, co-starring Akshay Kumar, Bobby Deol and Bipasha Basu. Later that year, she appeared in Santosh Sivan's period epic A\u015boka, a partly fictionalized account of the life of the Indian emperor of the same name. Featured opposite Shah Rukh Khan, Kapoor found herself challenged playing the complex personality of her character Kaurwaki (a Kalingan princess) with whom Ashoka falls in love. \"A\u015boka\"was screened at the Venice and 2001 Toronto International Film Festivals, and received generally positive reviews internationally but failed to do well in India, which was attributed by critics to the way Ashoka was portrayed. Jeff Vice of The Deseret News described Kapoor as \"riveting\" and commended her screen presence. Rediff.com, however, was more critical concluding that her presence in the film was primarily used for aesthetic purposes. At the 47th Filmfare Awards, A\u015boka was nominated for five awards including a Best Actress nomination for Kapoor. A key point in Kapoor's career came when she was cast by Karan Johar as Pooja (\"Poo\", a good-natured, superficial girl) in the 2001 melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... alongside an ensemble cast. Filming the big-budget production was a new experience for Kapoor, and she recalls it fondly: \"[I]t was great fun doing [the film and] we had a blast. [W]orking with the unit and the six mega star set was a dream come true.\" Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... was an immensely popular release, finishing as India's second highest-grossing film of the year and Kapoor's highest-grossing film to that point. It also became one of the biggest Bollywood success of all time in the overseas market, earning over \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide. Taran Adarsh described Kapoor as \"one of the main highlights of the film\", and she received her second Filmfare nomination for the role\u2014her first for Best Supporting Actress\u2014as well as nominations at the International Indian Academy (IIFA) and Screen Awards. Box Office India reported that the success of Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... established Kapoor as a leading actress of Hindi cinema, and Rediff.com published that with A\u015boka she had become the highest-paid Indian actress to that point earning \u20b915 million (US$230,000) per film. During 2002 and 2003, Kapoor continued to work in a number of projects but experienced a setback. All six films in which she starred\u2014Mujhse Dosti Karoge!, Jeena Sirf Merre Liye, Talaash: The Hunt Begins..., Khushi, Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon, and the four-hour war epic LOC Kargil\u2014were critically and commercially unsuccessful. Critics described her performances in these films as \"variations of the same character\" she played in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., and expressed concern that she was becoming typecast. By 2004, Kapoor was keen on broadening her range as an actress and thus decided to portray more challenging roles. Under the direction of Sudhir Mishra, Kapoor played the role of a golden-hearted prostitute in Chameli, a film relating the story of a young prostitute who meets with a widowed investment banker (played by Rahul Bose). When Kapoor was initially offered the film she refused it, explaining that she would be uncomfortable in the role. She relented when Mishra approached her for the second time, and in preparation for the role, visited several of Mumbai's red-light districts at night to study the mannerisms of sex workers and the way they dressed. Chameli was well received by critics and the film marked a significant turning point in her career, earning Kapoor a special jury recognition at the 49th Filmfare Awards. Indiatimes praised her \"intuitive brilliance\" and stated that she had exceeded all expectations. Rediff.com, however, found her portrayal unconvincing and excessively stereotypical, describing her as \"sounding more like a teenager playacting than a brash, hardened streetwalker\" and comparing her mannerisms to a caricature. Kapoor next co-starred in Mani Ratnam's bilingual project Yuva alongside Ajay Devgan, Abhishek Bachchan, Vivek Oberoi, Rani Mukerji and Esha Deol. The film, consisting of three chapters, tells the story of six individuals linked by a car accident. Kapoor is featured in the third chapter as Oberoi's love interest (Mira, a witty young woman). In a Times of India review film critic Subhash K. Jha described her role as \"fey and insubstantial\", but further stated that \"she turns these character traits to her own advantage to create a girl who is at once enigmatic and all-there\". She then appeared alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Fardeen Khan in Govind Nihalani's critically acclaimed film Dev, which revolved around the 2002 Hindu-Muslim riots in the Indian state of Gujarat. Kapoor's role was that of a Muslim victim named Aaliya, modelled after Zaheera Sheikh (a key witness in Vadodara's Best Bakery case). It earned her a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress and nominations for Best Actress at various award ceremonies. Taran Adarsh described her as \"first-rate\" and in particular noted her scene with Bachchan's character. Shortly afterwards, Kapoor was cast for the first time as a villain in the thriller Fida. Set against the backdrop of the Mumbai underworld, the film follows the story of an online heist in which her character, Neha Mehra, becomes involved. Although the film was unsuccessful at the box office, Kapoor received positive reviews for her performance, and some critics noted a distinct progression from her earlier roles. Her subsequent releases that year included Abbas-Mustan's thriller Aitraaz and Priyadarshan's comedy Hulchul, both of which were successful at the Indian box office. Following the success of her last two releases, she was cast as the protagonist of the 2005 drama Bewafaa. The feature received mostly negative reviews, and Kapoor's portrayal of Anjali Sahai (an unfaithful woman) was not well received. Nikhat Kazmi of Indiatimes believed that to become a serious actress Kapoor was embodying a maturer, more-jaded character beyond her years in Bewafaa. That same year, she starred in the romantic dramas Kyon Ki and Dosti: Friends Forever, both of which underperformed at the box office; however, Kapoor's performance in Kyon Ki was generally well received by critics (with the BBC describing her as \"a pure natural\"). In 2006, Kapoor appeared in three films. She first starred in the thriller 36 China Town, followed by the comedy Chup Chup Ke; both were moderately successful. She next portrayed the character of Desdemona in Omkara\u2014the Hindi adaptation of William Shakespeare's Othello. The film (directed by Vishal Bhardwaj) is a tragedy of sexual jealousy set against the backdrop of the political system in Uttar Pradesh. Describing Bhardwaj as a \"world-class director [with] a unique style\", Kapoor was cast in the project after the director had seen her performance in Yuva, and was subsequently required to attend script-reading sessions along with the entire cast. The feature premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and was screened at the Cairo International Film Festival. Omkara was received positively by critics, and Kapoor's portrayal earned her a fourth Filmfare Award and first Screen Award. In a 2010 retrospective of the \"Top 80 Iconic Performances\" of Hindi cinema, Filmfare wrote that she was \"brilliant\" and praised her ability to \"effortless[ly]\" convey the various emotions her character went through. Kapoor considered her role in Omkara as a \"new benchmark\" in her career, and compared her portrayal of Dolly with her own evolving maturity as a woman. Following Omkara, Kapoor took a short break from acting, as she felt that \"nothing [was] challenging enough for me to say yes\". In an interview with The Times of India Kapoor commented, \"In my initial years in the industry, I pushed myself to do a lot of work because I was greedy. I did some films\u2014which I now regret\u2014purely for the money. Today, I want to do selective films.\" Later that year, she appeared briefly in one of the year's biggest hits, the Farhan Akhtar action-thriller Don (a remake of the 1978 film of the same name). Kapoor returned to film as the female protagonist Geet Dhillon, a vivacious Sikh girl with a zest for life, in the romantic comedy Jab We Met (2007). Director Imtiaz Ali was not a well-known figure before its production, with only one feature credit to his name, but Kapoor agreed to the film after being impressed with his \"mind-blowing\" script. Featured opposite Shahid Kapoor, the film relates the story of two people with contrasting personalities who meet on a train and eventually fall in love. The film was received favourably by critics and became successful at the box office with gross earnings of \u20b9303 million (US$4.7\u00a0million). Kapoor won several awards for her performance, including her second Screen Award and the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC commented that the role required a mixture of naivety and spontaneity, and that Kapoor \"steals the show\", as she \"shines as the rebellious but naive young woman [...]\". The critic Rajeev Masand labelled her the film's \"biggest strength, as she brings alive her character with not just those smart lines, but with the kind of candor actors seldom invest in their work.\" While shooting for Jab We Met, Kapoor and Shahid ended their three-year relationship. When asked by Mumbai Mirror, she stated \"I hold him in utmost regard, and I hope one day we could be good friends. He is a great guy.\" The following year, Kapoor co-starred in Vijay Krishna Acharya's action-thriller Tashan, where she met her future husband in actor Saif Ali Khan. Although a poll (conducted by Bollywood Hungama) named it the most anticipated release of the year, the film underperformed at the box office grossing \u20b9279 million (US$4.3\u00a0million) in India. After providing her voice for the character of Laila, the love interest of a street dog named Romeo, in the Yash Raj Films and Walt Disney Pictures animated film Roadside Romeo, Kapoor played a mistrustful wife who believed her husband was unfaithful in Rohit Shetty's comedy Golmaal Returns. A sequel to the 2006 film Golmaal: Fun Unlimited, the film had an ambivalent reception from critics, and Kapoor received mixed reviews. The Indian Express believed the screenplay was derivative, concluding: \"There is nothing particularly new about a suspicious wife keeping tabs on her husband, and there is nothing particularly new in the way Kareena plays it.\" Golmaal Returns was a financial success with global revenues of \u20b9793 million (US$12\u00a0million). In 2009, Kapoor was cast as Simrita Rai (a surgeon who moonlights as a model) in Sabbir Khan's battle-of-the-sexes comedy Kambakkht Ishq, opposite Akshay Kumar. Set in Los Angeles, it was the first Indian film to be shot at Universal Studios and featured cameo appearances by Hollywood actors. The film was poorly received by critics but became an economic success, earning over \u20b9840 million (US$13\u00a0million) worldwide; a review in Times of India described Kapoor's performance as \"a complete let-down\" and \"unconvincing\". The box-office flop Main Aurr Mrs Khanna came next, following which she played the leading lady in the dramatic thriller Kurbaan, alongside Saif Ali Khan and Vivek Oberoi. The film (which marked the directorial debut of Rensil D'Silva) featured Kapoor as Avantika Ahuja, a woman who is confined to house arrest after discovering that her husband is a terrorist. Describing the film as \"an emotionally draining experience\", Kapoor explained that it was difficult to disconnect from her character. The film was critically praised, and Kapoor received her fourth Filmfare Best Actress nomination. Gaurav Malani of The Economic Times commented that after a long time the actress was given \"a role of substance that brings her performing potential to the fore\", while Subhash K. Jha described it as her \"most consistently pitched performance to date\" played \"with splendid sensitivity\" and \"credib[ility]\". Kapoor's second Filmfare nomination that year came for Rajkumar Hirani's National Film Award-winning 3 Idiots, a film loosely based on the novel Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat. Co-starring alongside Aamir Khan, R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi, Kapoor played Pia (a medical student and Khan's love interest). Several actresses were considered for the role, though Kapoor was eventually cast under the recommendation of Khan. The film received critical acclaim and emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time up until then, grossing \u20b92.03 billion (US$31\u00a0million) in India. It also did well internationally, earning over \u20b91.08 billion (US$17\u00a0million), the second biggest Bollywood success ever in the overseas market. The Deccan Herald opined that Kapoor \"brings a dollop of sunshine and feminine grace to an otherwise masculine tale. She is so spunky and spontaneous you wish there was room for more of her.\" 3 Idiots received several Best Movie recognitions at major Indian award functions, and Kapoor was awarded the IIFA Award for Best Actress, among others. In 2010, Kapoor appeared in the romantic comedy Milenge Milenge, a production delayed since 2005. The feature garnered negative reviews and poor box-office returns. Kapoor's role was small, and not well received. She next starred alongside Kajol and Arjun Rampal in We Are Family, an official adaptation of the Hollywood tearjerker Stepmom (1998) from director Siddharth Malhotra. Kapoor played the role of the career-oriented Shreya Arora (a character originally played by Julia Roberts) and refrained from watching the film again so she could bring her own interpretation to it. Priyanka Roy of The Telegraph criticized the film for being \"superficial and unnecessarily melodramatic\", but praised Kapoor for \"breath[ing] life and a new-found maturity into what is largely a uni-dimensional character\". We Are Family emerged a moderate success and Kapoor was awarded the Best Supporting Actress at the 56th Filmfare Awards. At the end of the year, she reunited with director Rohit Shetty for Golmaal 3, a sequel to Golmaal Returns. Like its predecessor, the film received mixed reviews though emerged as the most successful entry in the Golmaal series, earning more than \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million) domestically. For her portrayal of the tomboy Daboo, Kapoor received Best Actress nominations at various award ceremonies including Filmfare. Kapoor had further success in 2011 as the love interest of Salman Khan's character in the romantic drama Bodyguard, a remake of the 2010 Malayalam film of the same name. The film was not well received by critics, though became a financial success, with a domestic total of \u20b91.4 billion (US$22\u00a0million)\u2014India's highest-earning film of the year. A review in Mint dismissed Kapoor's role as the \"sacrificial, ornamental [and] submissive female\"; Mid Day referred to her as \"bright\", arguing that she \"actually manages to bring her caricature of a role alive\". She next appeared in Anubhav Sinha's science fiction film Ra.One with Shah Rukh Khan and Arjun Rampal. Made on a budget of \u20b91.5 billion (US$23\u00a0million)\u2014\"India's most expensive film\" at the time\u2014the film follows the story of a London-based videogame designer creating a villainous character who escapes into the real world. Despite negative media coverage of the film's box office performance, Ra.One became one of the biggest earners of the year with a worldwide total of over \u20b92.4 billion (US$37\u00a0million), and Kapoor's fourth major commercial success in two consecutive years. Kapoor followed her success in Bodyguard and Ra.One with a role in Shakun Batra's directorial debut Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu (2012) opposite Imran Khan. Set in Las Vegas, the romantic comedy follows the story of two strangers who get married one night after getting drunk. She played Riana Braganza, a carefree young woman, and was particularly drawn to the qualities of her character: \"Riana knows what she is doing. Even though she does not have a house or a job, she is a positive person [...] very similar to the way I am.\" The film received positive reviews and was an economic success, grossing a total of \u20b9530 million (US$8.2\u00a0million) in India and abroad. The Hollywood Reporter found her \"endearingly natural\"; Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com asserted that \"after doing ornamental roles in films like Bodyguard and Ra.One, it is nice to see the spunky actress in her element again since Jab We Met.\" She next appeared in Agent Vinod, an espionage thriller directed by Sriram Raghavan. Kapoor was enthusiastic about the project, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast. When asked why she had taken the role, Kapoor described it as an opportunity to attempt something she had never done before. For her next feature, Kapoor was cast as the protagonist of Madhur Bhandarkar's Heroine, a drama revolving around the Bollywood film industry. Originally the first choice for the role, Kapoor was hesitant to take on the project when Bhandarkar approached her with the film's initial concept. With reservations about the criticism her character might evoke, she was replaced by Aishwarya Rai. Days after production began, Rai left the film (due to her pregnancy) and Bhandarkar re-approached Kapoor with the film. When the director reinforced his faith in her, she agreed to do the film after having read the completed script. Kapoor (who described her character of Mahi Arora\u2014a fading star\u2014as \"bipolar and schizophrenic\") refrained from taking on any other projects, since she found Heroine \"very aggressive and tiring\". Reviewers found the film to be \"drably monotonous\", but noted that it was watchable primarily due to Kapoor's performance. Rajeev Masand described it as \"a deliciously camp performance,\" played \"with utmost sincerity\". Bollywood Hungama opined that it was her best work to date and concluded that \"[t]hough her character is inconsistent [...] Kareena furnishes the heroine's character with a rare vulnerability and an exceptional inner life.\" At the annual Stardust Awards, Kapoor garnered the Editor's Choice for Best Actress, and received additional nominations at Filmfare, IIFA, Producers Guild, Screen and Stardust. On 16 October 2012, Kapoor married actor Saif Ali Khan in a private ceremony in Bandra, Mumbai, and a reception was later held at The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and the Lutyens Bungalow Zone in Mumbai and Delhi respectively. Kapoor stated that despite adding Khan to her name she would continue practising Hinduism after her marriage. At the end of the year, she co-starred alongside Aamir Khan and Rani Mukerji as the \"tantalisingly seductive prostitute\" Rosie, in Reema Kagti's crime mystery Talaash: The Answer Lies Within. Set against the backdrop of Mumbai's red-light districts, it follows the travails of its personnel and principal, Inspector Surjan Singh Shekhawat (Khan) who is assigned the duty of solving a mysterious car accident. Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph found Kapoor to be a standout among the ensemble, adding that \"she brings an unseen mix of oomph and emotion that becomes the [film's] centrepiece\". With global revenues of \u20b91.74 billion (US$27\u00a0million), the film emerged as a box office hit, and earned Kapoor Best Actress nominations at the Screen, Stardust and Zee Cine award ceremonies. In 2013, Kapoor collaborated with Ajay Devgan for the fourth time (alongside Amitabh Bachchan, Arjun Rampal, Manoj Bajpayee and Amrita Rao) in Prakash Jha's Satyagraha, an ensemble socio-political drama loosely inspired by social activist Anna Hazare's fight against corruption in 2011. The film received little praise from critics and underperformed at the box office earning \u20b9675 million (US$10\u00a0million) domestically. A review in the Daily News and Analysis noted that Kapoor's role as reporter Yasmin Ahmed was \"limited to mouthing a few 'important' dialogues and being present in crucial scenes like any leading lady\". Following an appearance in the poorly received romantic comedy Gori Tere Pyaar Mein (2013), Kapoor decreased her workload for the next two years to focus on her marriage and family. She took on smaller parts where she played the love-interest of Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan in the dramas Singham Returns (2014) and Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015) respectively. Singham Returns served as a sequel to the 2011 film Singham and Kapoor's role was written specifically for her by Rohit Shetty\u2014the third time the pair collaborated. Reviews for the film were generally mixed with Kapoor being criticized for taking a role of minimal importance, but the film was a financial success with a revenue of over \u20b91.4 billion (US$22\u00a0million). Kabir Khan's Bajrangi Bhaijaan emerged as India's highest-earning film of the year grossing a total of \u20b93.20 billion (US$50\u00a0million), and earned the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment at the 63rd National Film Awards. The following year, Kapoor took on a starring role opposite Arjun Kapoor in Ki & Ka, a romantic comedy about gender stereotypes from the writer-director R. Balki. She was cast as the ambitious and career-oriented Kia, and was particularly drawn to the project for its relevance and novel concept. Critics were divided in their opinion of the film, but it emerged a financial success grossing over \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide. Meena Iyer of The Times of India mentioned Kapoor as \"terrific\" and Sukanya Verma considered the actress to be the film's prime asset noting her ease at \"smoothly transition[ing] between fragile and volatile to reveal a woman comfortable in her own skin, unapologetic about living life on her terms and never missing an occasion to mince words.\" Kapoor next played the role of Dr. Preet Sahni in Abhishek Chaubey's critically acclaimed Udta Punjab (2016), a crime drama that documents the substance abuse endemic in the Indian state of Punjab. Co-starring alongside Shahid Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and Diljit Dosanjh, Kapoor was initially reluctant to do the film due to the length of her role, but agreed after having read the completed script and waived half of her fees to star in it. Udta Punjab generated controversy when the Central Board of Film Certification deemed that the film represented Punjab in a negative light and demanded extensive censorship before its theatrical release. The Bombay High Court later cleared the film for exhibition with one scene cut. Rediff.com stated that despite being \"the narrative\u2019s most conventional character,\" the film \"greatly relies on [her] for warmth and virtue\" and Mehul S. Thakkar of The Deccan Chronicle wrote that she was successful in \"deliver[ing] a strong and hard hitting performance.\" For her performance, Kapoor received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the 62nd Filmfare Awards. In May 2017, Kapoor will commence filming Shashanka Ghosh's Veere Di Wedding, a romantic comedy co-starring Sonam Kapoor, Swara Bhaskar and Shikha Talsania. Alongside her acting work, Kapoor has established a career as a designer and an author. During her five-year association with the retail chain Globus, Kapoor became the first Indian actress to launch her own line of clothing for women; she described the collaboration as being \"special\" and \"reflective of my personal sense of style\". Her collection made its debut several months later in stores across India, and was well received. Following the end of her contract with Globus, she expressed a desire to work with a design house to release her clothing line internationally, but later explained that those plans were on hold. In 2009, Kapoor collaborated with nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar on Don't Lose Your Mind, Lose Your Weight, a book which focused on the principles of healthy eating habits. Published by Random House Publications, the book was well received by critics, and sold 10,000 copies within its first twenty days. A follow-up titled, Women and The Weight Loss Tamasha, was released two years later. It addressed the weight loss concerns and eating habits of women in various parts of their life, and featured Kapoor in a voice-over for the audiobook. In February 2013, Kapoor released her autobiographical memoir: The Style Diary of a Bollywood Diva. Co-authored alongside Rochelle Pinto, it became the first book to be launched under the Shobhaa De imprint of Penguin Books\u2014a set of series that included celebrity memoirs, guides and biographies. In a review published by Mint, Shefalee Vasudev criticised the writing style as \"too-breezy\" but further stated that it is \"a well-produced book, reproducing chirpy little post-it notes and diet charts, punctuated with Bebo's stunning pictures from her private albums to fashion magazine covers.\" Later that year, she collaborated with Diwekar for the third time on The Indian Food Wisdom and The Art of Eating Right, a documentary film about nutrition. During her years in the film industry, Kapoor has made public appearances to support various philanthropic endeavours, and has been actively involved in promoting children's education and the safety of women. In November 2003, she performed at a fundraiser for the World Youth Peace Summit and two years later she participated in a concert to raise money for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. In 2005, she visited Indian jawans (troops) in Rajasthan, for a special Holi weekend episode of NDTV's reality show Jai Jawaan. As part of the 2010 NDTV Greenathon Campaign, Kapoor adopted the village of Chanderi in Madhya Pradesh to provide the village with a regular supply of electricity, and also took part in the international campaign 1GOAL Education for All. The following year, Kapoor was appointed ambassador for the Shakti Campaign\u2014a project launched by NDTV to combat violence against women\u2014in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day. In December 2013, Kapoor launched Channel V's anti-rape mobile app 'VithU'; she stated that with an increasing amount of violence against women in India, \"[i]t [was] important for actors to stand up for issues because they can reach out to a lot of people.\" Kapoor later attended a gala dinner at the Taj Mahal Hotel (hosted by Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler) where she participated in a campaign to raise awareness on hunger and malnutrition in the world. In 2014, Kapoor began working with UNICEF to advocate the education of girls and increase quality based education in India. During the first year, Kapoor visited schools in the states of Rajasthan and Maharashtra where she interacted with students and participated in fundraising events hosted by the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya organization in the Jalna district. As part of a joint initiative by UNICEF and Groupon to help raise funds for promoting a higher-quality learning environment in Indian schools, Kapoor gave an equivalent amount of the funds raised during the campaign, and later launched the 'Child-Friendly School and Systems' (CFSS) package. In 2015, (along with chief minister Raman Singh) she awarded 31 students and 5 teachers for their contribution towards the field of education in Chhattisgarh at the concluding ceremony of Child Rights Protection week. Also that year, Kapoor provided a voice-over for the documentary film Girl Rising: Woh Padhegi, Woh Udegi [She will learn, she will fly] for the organisation of the same name and made donations to the Kashmir flood relief. Kapoor has participated in several stage shows and world tours since 2002. Her first tour (Heartthrobs: Live in Concert (2002) with Hrithik Roshan, Karisma Kapoor, Arjun Rampal and Aftab Shivdasani) was successful in the United States and Canada. At the end of that year, she performed with several other Bollywood stars at Kings Park Stadium in Durban, South Africa in the show Now or Never. Four years later, Kapoor returned to the stage with six other Bollywood celebrities in the successful Rockstars Concert world tour. The concert was originally scheduled to commence in April 2006, but was postponed due to the arrest of Salman Khan. It later began the following month and was staged in 19 cities across the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. In 2008, Kapoor performed in Shah Rukh Khan's Temptation Reloaded 2008, a series of concerts in a number of countries. The show (which also featured Arjun Rampal, Katrina Kaif, Ganesh Hegde, Javed Ali and Anusha Dandekar) debuted at the Ahoy Rotterdam venue in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Several months later she again joined Khan, Rampal and Kaif to perform for an audience of 15,000 at Dubai's Festival City Arena. Known for her nonchalant relationship with the media, Kapoor has gained a reputation for discussing her private life with no reservations. As a child she regularly attended award ceremonies and events with her family, and would also accompany Karisma on-set during filming. In an interview with Filmfare, she explained that growing up in a film family helped her develop a sense of professionalism and dedication towards her craft. Kapoor's private life has been the subject of media attention in India, with frequent press coverage of her weight and relationship with actor Saif Ali Khan. The couple\u2014dubbed \"Saifeena\" by the entertainment media\u2014has been one of the country's most-reported celebrity stories since 2007, and Kapoor later gave birth to their son Taimur on 20 December 2016. While a segment of the press has described Kapoor as friendly and extremely close to her family, others have criticized her for being arrogant and vain\u2014an image she gained in the wake of her superficial character, Poo, in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001). She subsequently featured in films portraying similar characters, and this further established her off- and on-screen personae. Before the release of Chameli (2004) (in which she played a sex worker), Kapoor stated that \"there is a certain image that people identify you with [and] [i]t always follows you whichever role you play. I am trying to transgress this image and become more screen-friendly than image-friendly.\" Chameli helped Kapoor reinvent her on-screen persona, and she later explained that her honesty and openness was often perceived by the media as arrogance. Kapoor is also known for her assertive and moody nature, and her outspoken views and independence have been singled out for making major contributions to her career; they \"add to her superstar aura\". In an early interview, she confessed to being an \"introvert, yet [...] extremely candid and blunt\", reasoning: \"Total faith and complete belief in myself is my attitude towards life, films and virtually everything else. I am all about doing what I feel is right. It is not easy to pin me down as I can be a bundle of contradictions.\" Journalist Subhash K Jha explained that while this approach has sometimes been at the cost of professional opportunities, it \"makes her such a favourite among the generation that believes in self regard being the highest form of creativity [...] She lives for the moment and crams all her intensity into it, not sparing a single thought for what is gone and what is waiting around the corner.\" Meanwhile, Anu Ahuja suggested that Kapoor's demeanour is an act; she is \"cold and unapproachable so that no one will act funny with her\". Today, Kapoor is considered as one of the most popular Bollywood celebrities in India. Her look and performances have established her as a style icon for young women. In a 2009 poll conducted by the newspaper Daily News and Analysis Kapoor was voted one of India's most popular icons; with her partner Saif Ali Khan, she was listed amongst the top celebrity endorsers for brands and products worldwide. She became the only Indian actress to be featured on CNNGo's list of \"Who Mattered Most in India\", and was later selected by Verve for its list of the country's most powerful women from 2008 to 2013. In June 2010, Kapoor was named \"India's Most Beautiful Woman\" by the Indian edition of People magazine; Eastern Eye and Indian Maxim named her as \"Asia's Sexiest Woman\" and \"India's Hottest Woman\" in 2011 and 2012 respectively. The following year, she was selected by India Today for its list of the country's most influential women. From 2012\u201316, Kapoor has featured on Forbes India's \"Celebrity 100,\" a list based on the income and popularity of India's celebrities, peaking at the seventh position in 2012 with an estimated annual earning of \u20b9735 million (US$11\u00a0million). According to media reports, Kapoor relies on her instincts and spontaneity as an actor. She is known to commit heavily to each role, and refrains from rehearsing for a project. Commenting on this, director Rajkumar Hirani said \"I usually have a habit of conducting rehearsals for my actors, but she insisted on not having them as it would affect her spontaneity. She really surprised me with a couple of emotional scenes which we canned in just one take.\" Karan Johar described Kapoor as a \"natural\", explaining that \"she has no craft, grammar or process attached to her acting [...] It is a great sense of cinema that can keep her going.\" According to Rensil D'Silva (who directed her in Kurbaan), \"Kareena [..] is instinctive and has emotional intelligence. She absorbs the situation and performs accordingly. Discussing the scene, in fact, harms her.\" While discussing her career highlights in a 2010 article, Rediff.com noted: \"[E]ven though a lot of her starring roles have been forgettable, [a] look at her filmography now, however, would show a more thoughtful selection of roles [...] playing to her strengths.\" Her portrayal of a series of superficial characters at the start of her career were criticized; film historian Gyan Prakash explained that these roles \"tended to infantilise her, packaging her as daddy's little girl, all bubble and no fizz\". Critics noted Chameli (2004) as her coming of age, claiming that \"a new actor in her was discovered\". Following her portrayal of a variety of character types in Chameli, Dev (2004), Omkara (2006) and Jab We Met (2007), Kapoor was noted for her versatility. In 2010, Filmfare Magazine included two of her performances\u2014from Omkara and Jab We Met\u2014in its list of \"80 Iconic Performances\". India Today labelled her \"the most versatile female lead in the industry\", noting that she \"play[s] her roles with trademark spunk\". Manjula Sen of The Telegraph wrote that although she has \"the worst success ratio among her contemporaries\", it does not affect her marketability. Sen further explained that Kapoor's strength lies in her being versatile; she is \"effortlessly honest in her performances. It is a candour that spills over in her personal conduct.\" Writing for CNN-News18, Rituparna Chatterjee spoke of her transformation to date: \"[A]fter 40 films and 10 years of fighting off competition from some of the most versatile actors of her generation, Kareena has matured into a bankable actor reinventing herself with surprising ease.\" In 2004, Kapoor placed third on Rediff's list of \"Top Bollywood Female Stars\". She was later ranked seventh and fifth in 2005 and 2006, respectively, and returned to third place in 2007. In January 2011, Kapoor placed fourth on Rediff's list of \"Top 10 Actresses of 2000\u20132010\". Kapoor has received six Filmfare Awards out of ten nominations. For her role in Refugee, Kapoor was awarded the Best Female Debut in 2000. She earned a special jury recognition for Chameli (2003), and two Critics Award for Best Actress for Dev (2004) and Omkara (2006). Kapoor later received the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress for Jab We Met (2007) and We Are Family (2010) respectively."

        "biography": " Karisma Kapoor (born 25 June 1974) is an Indian actress, who appears in Hindi films. One of the most popular and highest-paid actresses of India, Kapoor is particularly known for her work in the female-centric films and her film roles have been credited as a significant departure from the traditional portrayal of women in Hindi films. Kapoor is often regarded as the nation's most beautiful actress, and is the recipient of several accolades, including a National Film Award and four Filmfare Awards. Born and raised in Mumbai, she is a member of the Kapoor family, where her parents and other relatives are all involved in the Indian film industry. Despite her family background, her father disliked women entering films, and separated from her mother. Kapoor, at the age of seventeen, left her studies to pursue a film career for financial support, and made her acting debut with a leading role in the moderately successful Prem Qaidi (1991). Subsequently, Kapoor starred in a number of box-office hits, including the dramas Jigar (1992) and Anari (1993), the comedies Raja Babu (1994), Coolie No. 1 (1995) and Saajan Chale Sasural (1996), and the thriller Jeet (1996). However, she was criticised for her brief, repetitivein roles and inclination to male-dominated films. The 1996 blockbuster romance Raja Hindustani marked a significant turning point in Kapoor's career, earning her praise and a Filmfare Award for Best Actress. She later won the National Film Award and Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of a dancer in Yash Chopra's blockbuster musical romance Dil To Pagal Hai (1997). Kapoor achieved further success by featuring as the female lead in three of David Dhawan's top grossing romantic comedies\u2014Hero No.1 (1997), Biwi No.1 (1999) and Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge (2000), and Sooraj Barjatya's highly successful family drama Hum Saath-Saath Hain (1999)\u2014and won the Best Actress and Best Actress Critics awards at Filmfare for her titular roles in the highly acclaimed dramas Fiza (2000) and Zubeidaa (2001), respectively. She also received widespread praise for her performance in the 2002 revenge drama Shakti: The Power. Kapoor took a sabbatical from full-time acting in 2004, and made her comeback with the 2012 supernatural thriller Dangerous Ishqq, after which she again took sabbatical.   Kapoor was born on 25 June 1974 in Mumbai, to actors Randhir Kapoor and Babita (n\u00e9e Shivdasani). Her younger sister, Kareena, is also an actress. Her paternal grandfather was the actor and filmmaker Raj Kapoor, while her maternal grandfather was actor Hari Shivdasani. Her great-grandfather was actor Prithviraj. She is the niece of actors Rishi and Rajiv, and insurance agent Ritu. Actor Ranbir Kapoor and businessman Nikhil Nanda are her first cousins, while actress Sasha Agha is her distant relative. Actress Sadhana, was her mother's first cousin. According to Kapoor, the name \"Lolo\" was derived after her mother made a passing reference to the Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida. Both of her paternal and maternal grandparents were from Peshawar, Lyallpur and Karachi respectively, who moved to Bombay for their film careers, before the partition of India. Kapoor is of Hindu Punjabi descent on her father's side, and on her mother's side she is of Sindhi and British descent. She was particularly inspired by the work of actresses Sridevi and Madhuri Dixit.  Despite her family background, her father disapproved of women working in films, because he believed it conflicted with the traditional maternal duties and responsibility of women in the family. This led to a conflict between her parents and they separated in 1988. She and her sister, Kareena, were raised by her mother, who worked several jobs to raise them, until she made her debut in films as an actress. The couple reconciled in 2007, after living separately for several years. Kapoor studied at the Cathedral and John Connon School and later, for a few months, at Sophia College. Kapoor made her acting debut in 1991 at the age of seventeen with the romantic drama Prem Qaidi, opposite debutante Harish Kumar. Upon release, the film emerged as a moderate box office success and received mixed reviews from critics, as did Kapoor's performance, with Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama describing at as \"mechanical\". The following year, Kapoor's first five releases\u2014Police Officer, Jaagruti, Nishchaiy, Sapne Sajan Ke and Deedar\u2014flopped at the box office. Jaagruti and Nishchaiy marked her first two collaborations with Salman Khan, while Deedar marked her first collaboration with Akshay Kumar. She next starred in the action drama Jigar (1992), followed by the romantic drama Anari (1993), both of which emerged as box office hits and among the highest grossing films of their respective years. Jigar marked Kapoor's first of several collaborations with Ajay Devgn, while Anari featured her in the leading role of Rajnandini, a princess who falls in love with her poor servant (played by Daggubati Venkatesh). Kapoor's next four releases of 1993 were the dramas Muqabla (which marked first of her many collaborations with Govinda), Sangraam, Shaktiman and Dhanwaan. With the exception of Muqabla, none of these films performed well either critically or commercially. In 1994, Kapoor had nine film releases; four of them \u2014 Prem Shakti, Dulaara, Andaz and Aatish\u2014were critical and commercial failures. Her first hit that year was David Dhawan's comedy film Raja Babu, opposite Govinda, in which she played Madhubala, an educated arrogant girl who calls off her engagement upon discovering about her fianc\u00e9e's illiteracy. Kapoor next played the blind wife of Govinda's character in the hit action drama Khuddar, following which she starred with Salman Khan, Aamir Khan and Raveena Tandon in Rajkumar Santoshi's highly acclaimed comedy film Andaz Apna Apna. Kapoor played Raveena Bajaj, the daughter of a London-based business tycoon, who travels to India in search of true love, and falls for Salman Khan's character. Although the film underperformed at the box office, though developed a significant cult following over the years since its release. Kapoor's final two releases of the year were the action drama Suhaag (alongside Ajay Devgn, Akshay Kumar and Nagma) and the comedy-drama Gopi Kishan (alongside Suniel Shetty and Shilpa Shirodkar), both of which were critically and commercially successful. In the former, she starred as a college student and Devgn's love interest, while in the latter, she played a police commissioner's daughter who falls in love with a criminal. In 1995, post appearing in the box office flops Jawab and Maidan-E-Jung, Kapoor starred as Malti, a rich girl who marries a poor coolie (played by Govinda) in David Dhawan's blockbuster comedy film Coolie No. 1. The feature garnered good reviews and emerged as a commercial success grossing \u20b9911 million (US$14\u00a0million) in India. On her initial career struggle, she later said: When I first entered the industry, things were made tough for me. I am not saying that I was singled out. I think every star kid has to go through this. Everyone was so unfair to me. Other newcomers were praised for every little achievement, but I was not given an iota of acknowledgement. When it came to me, it was always, \u2018Okay, she has done well but what\u2019s the big deal about her?\u2019. Nobody gave me a 17-year-old credit for doing my job reasonably well. In 1996, Kapoor appeared in ten films. Five of them\u2014Papi Gudia, Megha, Bal Bramhachari, Sapoot, Rakshak\u2014were commercially unsuccessful. Her next release was David Dhawan's romance Saajan Chale Sasural, co-starring Govinda and Tabu. Saajan Chale Sasural emerged as a commercial success. For her fifth release, Kapoor was paired opposite Suneil Shetty in S. Deepak's box-office hit Krishna. She starred alongside Sunny Deol, Salman Khan and Tabu in Raj Kanwar's romantic drama Jeet. She played Kajal, a woman who falls in love with a criminal, but ends up marrying another man. Finishing up as the second highest-grossing film of the year, Jeet emerged as a \"super-hit\" at the box office. Critical reaction was positive on both the film as well as Kapoor's performance. That same year, Kapoor played the female lead in Dharmesh Darshan's Raja Hindustani opposite Aamir Khan. The movie was the highest-grossing film of the year and she won her first Filmfare Best Actress Award; the film's success established Kapoor as a leading actress of Hindi cinema, and marked a significant turning point in her career. Raja Hindustani, was not only the biggest commercial success of 1996, but also one of the most successful films of all time in India with revenues of \u20b94.8 billion (US$74\u00a0million). Kapoor's final release of 1996 was Suneel Darshan's action Ajay, with Sunny Deol. The film was also a financial success. In 1997, Kapoor re-united with David Dhawan for two projects, the comedy film Judwaa (alongside Salman Khan and Rambha), and the romantic comedy Hero No. 1 (opposite Govinda). The former's concept was similar to Gopi Kishan; it tells the story of twin brothers who are separated at birth and re-unite in their youth. Kapoor and Rambha played the love interests of Khan's characters. It was a moderate critical and commercial success. In Hero No. 1, she played Meena Nath, a girl who falls in love with Govinda's character while on a foreign trip, however, finds it hard to convince her strict grandfather (Paresh Rawal) of this relationship. A major critical and commercial success, the film earned Kapoor praise for her portrayal. She eventually received a nomination for Zee Cine Award for Best Actress for her work in the film. She next starred in Mehul Kumar-directed dramas, Lahu Ke Do Rang and Mrityudata, both of which were critical and commercial failures. Kapoor's fifth and final release of 1997 was Yash Chopra's musical romantic drama Dil To Pagal Hai. Co-starring Shah Rukh Khan and Madhuri Dixit, the film depicts the love stories of the dancers in a musical dance troupe. Kapoor played the supporting role of Nisha, a bubbly dancer who secretly falls in love with her best friend (played by Khan), however, unites her with the girl he loves (played by Dixit). Initially hesitant to take on the part, Kapoor was cast by Chopra (after he was impressed by her work in Raja Hindustani) post several leading actresses of the time had put down the role. Dil To Pagal Hai emerged as a blockbuster at the box office and proved to be the second highest-grossing film of the year. Kapoor remarked, \"I looked at the role not from a star's point of view but from that of an actress. And I discovered that despite its length there was a lot of scope for me as a performer\". Kapoor eventually won the National Film Award and Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role. The following year, Kapoor had no release, however, she was offered the second lead role in Karan Johar's blockbuster romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, which she rejected. Her diminutive comeback in 1999 proved to be good as she took part in the year's most successful films. Kapoor starred in four absolute hits. She next re-united with Dhawan and Salman Khan (alongside Sushmita Sen) for the romantic comedy Biwi No.1, in which she portrayed Pooja, a woman whose husband gets involved in an extra-marital affair with a model. The film which emerged as a major commercial success, earned Kapoor critical praise for her performance. Mohammad Ali Ikram of Planet Bollywood commented, \"Karisma may not look like a mother of two offspring, but she continues to mature as an actress with each successive film.\" Kapoor received a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her work in the film. She proved to be successful with comedy films, as David Dhawan's another film Haseena Maan Jaayegi, did fairly well at the box office. Kapoor collaborated for the first time with the Rajshri Productions for the family drama Hum Saath-Saath Hain: We Stand United. The film featured an ensemble cast (Mohnish Behl, Salman Khan, Tabu and Sonali Bendre) proved to be one of the biggest Bollywood success of all time in the market, earning over \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide. Her last release of the year, Jaanwar opposite Akshay Kumar, was another box office hit, making her the most successful actress of the year. Kapoor's first release of 2000 was Dhawan's romantic comedy Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge opposite Salman Khan. She played Sapna, a girl who falls for Khan's character while on a foreign trip, however, finds it tough to convince her three uncles of this relationship. The film finished up as one of the biggest hits of the year. Aparajita Saha of Rediff commented, \"Karisma Kapoor and Salman Khan elicit more than their fair share of cat calls in the movie and make a delectable pair. Both are in form \u2013 Karisma looks glamorous and at ease while Salman has perfected the lost-boy-muscle-man get up\". Kapoor's next two releases, the romantic comedies Chal Mere Bhai (opposite Khan and Dutt) and Hum To Mohabbat Karega (opposite Bobby Deol) failed to do well at the box office. That same year, Kapoor won her second Filmfare Best Actress Award for portraying the title role of a girl, in search of her brother, in Khalid Mohammed's crime drama Fiza, a film, which received critical acclaim. Her performance in the film was highly acclaimed and several critics noted her for showing great emotional range and depth. Mimmy Jain of The Indian Express, in a positive review, wrote, \"As the young girl who is sick of the suspense and disruption that her brother's disappearance has caused in her family's life, as the obstinate daughter who will not listen to her mother's plea to let her keep hoping for her son, as the determined sister who keeps on in her hunt for her brother despite all odds and then seeks to keep him on the right path, this is a new Karisma, and one that delivers a superbly flawless performance.\" Planetbollywood.com described Kapoor \"A multifaceted actress. Kapoor has not diminished her demand\". The film emerged as a \"semi hit\" at the box-office with a worldwide gross of \u20b9878 million (US$14\u00a0million). In 2001, she achieved further critical acclaim for her portrayal of a real life actress in the biographical drama Zubeidaa. Directed by Shyam Benegal, the film was based on the life of an ill-fated actress Zubeida Begum, who married a Sikh Hanwant Singh. The Tribune complimented her by arguing that she \"has surpassed herself as the passionate, defiant, wilful and troubled Zubeidaa, the truly modern woman.\" In an interview with Rediff she explained, \"I have been here so long, I have done everything. Lead roles, supporting roles, everything. How do I grow as a performer? If I keep doing commercial cinema, I will stagnate and I wanted to grow\". For her work, she was awarded the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress and also garnered a Best Actress nomination at the ceremony. Co-starring Rekha and Manoj Bajpai, the film had worldwide earnings of over \u20b9239.552 million (US$3.7\u00a0million). She next starred alongside Bobby Deol and Rahul Dev in Indra Kumar's Aashiq, the movie received little praise from critics, though proved to be a modest success grossing over \u20b9260 million (US$4.0\u00a0million) domestically. A review in Planet Bollywood said about her performance, \"Acting-wise, Karisma is unchallenged as she reverts from substance roles like Zubeidaa, back to her shrieking annoying self (is it acting, or just natural?)\". Suneel Darshan's social drama Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love was Kapoor's next release. Co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, the film became one of the biggest hits of the year. In 2002, Kapoor had three film releases, of which first was the romantic drama Haan Maine Bhi Pyaar Kiya, opposite Akshay Kumar and Abhishek Bachchan. She next starred alonsgide Nana Patekar in the woman-centric drama Shakti: The Power, playing the role of Nandini, a woman who wants to fly away from her in-laws (involved in feudal gang wars) along with her son, post her husband's death. The film, a remake of the Telugu film Antahpuram (1998), was itself based on the life of author Betty Mahmoody. Shakti: The Power was critically acclaimed and also earned Kapoor highly positive reviews for her portrayal; Taran Adarsh reviewed, \"The power clearly belongs to Karisma Kapoor. Breathing fire and venom to win back her son from the clutches of a despot, the actress gives it all to the character of a helpless mother and proves what a virtuoso performer she is. Playing the part of a wounded tigress, this is one performance that overshadows all the performances the year has seen so far\". Kapoor's work in the film earned her Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies, including fifth at Filmfare. Her final release that year was Indra Kumar's romantic drama Rishtey, alongside Anil Kapoor and Shilpa Shetty. She featured as Komal, a wealthy woman who falls in love with a poorer man and marries him against her father's wish. Despite much anticipation, Kapoor's all three releases that year underperformed at the box office. In 2003, she starred in Baaz: A Bird in Danger which was her only release that year. Later in the same year she made her television debut in the Sahara One soap opera Karishma - The Miracles of Destiny in which she played a dual role of a grandmother and granddaughter.

Kapoor made her comeback as an actress with a leading role in Vikram Bhatt's supernatural thriller Dangerous Ishhq. Co-starring Rajneesh Duggal, the film spans over a period of four centuries and tells four different love stories set in different time periods. Kapoor played four characters, one from each century. A major critical and box office failure, the film generated positive reviews for Kapoor's portrayal. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama commented, \"Karisma Kapoor puts forth her best efforts, getting to deliver lines in varied dialects. She gets the dialects right, especially Urdu and Rajasthani, but there's not much scope for her to display her acting prowess\". In 2013, Kapoor made a special appearance alongwith several other actors in the titular song of the anthology film Bombay Talkies, which was made to honour the Hindi film industry for completeing hundred years. In late 2017, Kapoor will reprise the role of Mala, in a cameo appearance alongwith Salman Khan in the romantic comedy Judwaa 2, a sequel to Judwaa.

At a fashion show in London, filmmaker Kaizad Gustad spotted Kaif and decided to cast her in Boom (2003), a critical and commercial failure. While filming in India, Kaif received modelling assignments and established a successful modelling career. However, filmmakers were hesitant to cast her due to her poor command of Hindi. After appearing in the Telugu film, Malliswari (2004), Kaif earned commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya? (2005) and Namastey London (2007). She followed with a series of box-office hits, but was criticised for her acting, repetitive roles and inclination to male-dominated films. Kaif's performance in the 2009 terrorism drama New York was better received, earning her a Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination. After roles in Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009), Raajneeti (2010) and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011), she received her second Filmfare nomination for her performance in Mere Brother Ki Dulhan (2011). Kaif featured in the thrillers Ek Tha Tiger (2012) and Dhoom 3 (2013), both of which rank among the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics for her acting prowess, she has established herself as a commercially successful actress of Hindi cinema. In addition to acting, Kaif is involved with her mother's charity and participates in stage shows. She is guarded about her personal life, which is a subject of media scrutiny, as is her background.   Katrina Kaif was born in Hong Kong with her mother's surname Turquotte (also spelt Turcotte), on 16 July 1983.[a] According to the actress, her father (Mohammed Kaif) is a British businessman of Kashmiri descent and her mother (Suzanne, also spelt Susanna) is an English lawyer and charity worker. She has seven siblings: three elder sisters (Stephanie, Christine, and Natasha), three younger sisters (Melissa, Sonia, and Isabel) and an elder brother, Michael. Isabel Kaif is also a model and actress. Kaif's parents divorced when she was a child, and her father moved to the United States. She said her father had no influence on Kaif or her siblings while they were growing up, and they were raised by their mother. On her father's absence in her life, Kaif stated: \"When I see friends who have wonderful fathers who are like pillars of support for their families, I say, if only I had that. But instead of complaining, I should be grateful for all the other things I have\". In a 2009 interview with The Indian Express, she said she was not in touch with her father. Kaif says that her mother decided to \"dedicate her life to social causes\", which led to the family's relocation to a number of countries for varying lengths of time: Our transitions in growing up were\u2014from Hong Kong where I was born, to China, then to Japan, and from Japan by boat to France\u00a0... After France, Switzerland\u2014and I'm cutting out many East European countries where we were for only a few months each\u2014then Poland in Krak\u00f3w\u00a0... After that we went to Belgium, then to Hawaii, which was a short time, and then came to London. Due to their frequent relocation, Kaif and her siblings were home-schooled by a series of tutors. Although she is thought to have grown up in London, she lived there for only three years before moving to India. According to Kaif, she then changed her surname to her father's because she thought it would be easier to pronounce. Kaif's paternal parentage has been questioned by some members of the film industry. In a 2011 interview with Mumbai Mirror, Boom producer Ayesha Shroff accused Kaif of fabricating her history: \"We created an identity for her. She was this pretty young English girl, and we gave her the Kashmiri father and thought of calling her Katrina Kazi. We thought we'd give her some kind of Indian ancestry, to connect with the audience\u00a0... But then we thought that Kazi sounded too\u00a0... religious?\u00a0... Mohammad Kaif was at the top, and so we said, Katrina Kaif sounds really great\". Kaif called Shroff's comments \"hurtful\". At the age of fourteen, Kaif won a beauty contest in Hawaii, and received her first modelling assignment in a jewellery campaign. She subsequently modelled professionally in London, working for freelance agencies and appearing regularly at London Fashion Week. At a fashion show Kaif attracted the attention of London-based filmmaker Kaizad Gustad. He selected her for a role in the English-Hindi erotic heist film Boom as part of an ensemble cast that included Amitabh Bachchan, Gulshan Grover, Jackie Shroff, Madhu Sapre and Padma Lakshmi. While filming in India, Kaif received other offers and decided to stay in the country. In 2003, she received notice as a model after walking the ramp for Rohit Bal at the India Fashion Week and appeared in the first Kingfisher Calendar. Kaif soon established a successful modelling career in India after endorsing brands such as Coca-Cola, LG, Fevicol and Samsung. Kaif's career as a model led to anticipation surrounding her Bollywood debut. Boom (2003) had its first screening at the Cannes Film Festival, and was heavily promoted at the event. Boom was a commercial and critical failure. Kaif's enactment of a supermodel ensnared in the Mumbai underworld was poorly received, with Ziya U. Salam of The Hindu attributing the weak performances of the film's leading ladies to \"the vacuity of their expressions\". Hindustan Times reported that after Boom's release, Kaif was written off due to her poor Hindi and thick British accent. She later dismissed the film: \"I don't count Boom among important happenings in my life. When I signed this film, I didn't know much about India and its film audience\". Although Kaif was offered a number of modelling assignments, filmmakers were hesitant to cast her because of her poor command of Hindi. In one instance, Mahesh Bhatt replaced her with Tara Sharma in Saaya (2003) as he found her an \"inconsistent performer\". Subsequently, Kaif began working on her diction through Hindi classes. After the failure of her first Bollywood project, Kaif appeared in the Telugu film Malliswari (2004). With Daggubati Venkatesh, she played the title role of a princess forced to flee from her murderous caretaker. Kaif received a reported \u20b97.5 million (US$120,000) for the film, the highest salary for a South Indian film actress at the time. Despite negative reviews for her acting, Malliswari was a profitable venture. The following year, Kaif appeared briefly as Abhishek Bachchan's girlfriend in Ram Gopal Varma's political thriller Sarkar. She next featured alongside Salman Khan, Sushmita Sen and Sohail Khan in Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya?, a film she considered her \"first real step into Bollywood\". Directed by David Dhawan, the film was a successful remake of the romantic comedy Cactus Flower. For her role as a suicidal model, Kaif received the Stardust Award for Breakthrough Performance \u2013 Female. According to Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com, \"Katrina's Disney princess-like charm adds to her adorable screen presence\". Kaif followed with a small part in her second Telugu film, Allari Pidugu. In 2006, she appeared with Akshay Kumar for the first of many films in Raj Kanwar's unsuccessful Humko Deewana Kar Gaye, a story of two like-minded strangers who fall in love despite being engaged to others. Sify wrote that Kaif was \"passably competent in a tailor-made role, giving a mild emotional spin to a couple of scenes\" but was overshadowed by her supporting actresses. Kaif also appeared with Mammootty in the Malayalam crime thriller Balram vs. Tharadas, in which Rishi Raj Singh of The Hindu called her performance \"marvellous\". Kaif's career prospects changed in 2007, when she appeared in four Bollywood hits. In an interview with The Indian Express, she called Vipul Amrutlal Shah's romantic comedy Namastey London a milestone, saying that \"for the first time, [she] had a dominating role\". Kaif used her life in London as a reference for her role as a spoilt British Indian girl intent on marrying her self-centred British boyfriend, despite her parents' disapproval. Although critics expressed mixed views on the film, Sukanya Verma wrote that Kaif \"suits the role to the T\" and \"brings the zingy mix of her character alive with style and substance\". Kaif's chemistry with co-star Akshay Kumar was particularly well received, with Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India calling their casting \"refreshing\". She had a supporting role as a doctor in the sports drama Apne. The film was highly anticipated as it marked the first appearance of Dharmendra with his sons, Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol. After Apne she rejoined director David Dhawan and Salman Khan for the comedy Partner, a remake of Hitch which also starred Govinda and Lara Dutta. With a worldwide revenue of \u20b91.03 billion (US$16\u00a0million), the film was a major financial success. Kaif's final film of the year was Anees Bazmee's comedy Welcome, alongside Akshay Kumar, Nana Patekar, Mallika Sherawat and Anil Kapoor. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, it proved to be the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2007. The similarity of Kaif's roles was noted by Shoma Chaudhury of Tehelka, who called her \"unabashed eye-candy\", adding that she was \"a pretty prop in Welcome\" and \"more of the same in Partner and Apne\". In 2008, the actress had three releases, the first of which was Abbas-Mustan's action thriller Race, a story about two stepbrothers-turned-rivals who are in contention for their father's insurance money. Kaif played Saif Ali Khan's secretary, who is his stepbrother's (Akshaye Khanna) lover. Nikhat Kazmi was appreciative of the film, praising its \"super cool look [and] testosterone-high action sequences\" but found Kaif \"too pale\" in her role. After Race, Kaif rejoined Akshay Kumar in Anees Bazmee's action comedy Singh Is Kinng. The film earned \u20b91.25 billion (US$19\u00a0million) worldwide, making it Kaif's sixth consecutive box-office success. However, she received mixed reviews for her performance. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN reviewed: \"Katrina Kaif is an eyesore\u00a0... her acting so weak you want to urge her to watch everyone from Madhubala to Madhuri so she might pick up a few tricks\". Kaif's final film of the year\u2014Subhash Ghai's drama Yuvvraaj\u2014was a major box-office failure. In preparation for her role as a cellist she practised her playing with orchestra members. Her portrayal of a girl forbidden by her father from marrying her poor lover was well received by Sify's Sonia Chopra: \"Katrina is wonderful, plays the cello convincingly, and looks ethereal\". Despite the film's mixed critical reception, its screenplay was added to the library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for its artistic merit. Before New York, Kaif's voice was dubbed over by voice artists in most of her films due to her lack of fluency in Hindi and other Indian languages.[b] Although she appeared in a series of successful films, critics noted that she had little to do in them as they were generally male-dominated. Her performances were also largely criticised. About her series of glamorous roles, Kaif said that her \"first few films were really a process of learning\u00a0... There was no target\". After a string of films in which she was cast to add glamour, Kaif appeared in Kabir Khan's terrorism drama New York (2009). Featuring John Abraham and Neil Nitin Mukesh in lead roles, the film tells the story of how three friends' lives are changed when the former is wrongly detained after 9/11. Kaif played Maya, a college student who later marries a terrorist. The actress said that she identified with Maya, since she experienced similar isolation because of her skin colour when she was growing up in London. Kaif also remarked that she was tired of \"arm candy\" roles and was looking for more substantial parts. New York did well at the box office and received favourable reviews. According to Subhash K. Jha, Kaif \"comes into her own as an actress of substance\u00a0... From the carefree effervescent campus girl to the anguished wife, Katrina makes the journey look plausible all the way\". New York brought Kaif her first Filmfare Award nomination for Best Actress. She then appeared in a cameo for India's first underwater thriller Blue. Kaif starred with Ranbir Kapoor in Rajkumar Santoshi's hit comedy, Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009), as an orphan forced to marry a rich man. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama wrote, \"Katrina Kaif continues to surprise\u00a0... She scores in both emotional and light scenes\" and called her chemistry with Kapoor \"electrifying\". Her final film of the year was Priyadarshan's comedy De Dana Dan. In 2010, Kaif appeared in Prakash Jha's political thriller Raajneeti as part of an ensemble cast which included Ranbir Kapoor, Ajay Devgan, Arjun Rampal, Nana Patekar, Manoj Bajpai and Sarah Thompson. The film took inspiration from The Mahabharata and Mario Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather. Set in Bhopal, the film described a fiercely fought election campaign by two parties attempting to seize power with manipulation, corruption and treachery. Although there was media speculation before the film's release that Kaif's character was based on Sonia Gandhi, the actress denied this. In preparation for her role as Indu (a politician loosely based on Draupadi), she watched Priyanka Gandhi's election campaign videos to study the body language and interaction of politicians. The film received mainly positive reviews from critics. Rajeev Masand found Raajneeti \"thrilling and gripping\", though Namrata Joshi was more critical and expressed her disappointment over the film's depiction of women. Nikhat Kazmi considered Kaif's performance to be \"carefree and camera-unconscious\" and wrote that she \"seems to slip into the high-powered shoes easily\". The film was highly successful at the box office, receiving a total collection of \u20b91.4 billion (US$22\u00a0million). Kaif collaborated with Akshay Kumar for the sixth time in the slapstick comedy Tees Maar Khan (2010). For her role as an aspiring actress, Kaif appeared in a popular item number titled \"Sheila Ki Jawani\". The song was choreographed by the film's director Farah Khan and for the belly dancing portion of the song, Kaif was trained by expert Veronica D'Souza. \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" was often compared to another item number released the same year \"Munni Badnaam Hui\" from Dabangg. Despite the song's popularity, Tees Maar Khan was panned by critics and underperformed at the box office. Kaif's portrayal was not well received; Renuka Rao of Daily News and Analysis said that her \"drama queen act is performed\u00a0... poorly\", but noted that she \"does full justice\" to the item number. The following year, Kaif was paired with Hrithik Roshan in Zoya Akhtar's coming-of-age dramedy Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. The film narrates the story of three friends on a bachelor trip, and how the workaholism of one was overcome with the help of Laila (Kaif). The film was a critical and commercial success. Richard Kuipers of Variety commented that she is \"delightful as the sweet-natured girl who inspires everyone to look in the mirror and do something about it\". Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara was one of the most awarded films of the year and received numerous Best Film accolades. Kaif then featured in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Mere Brother Ki Dulhan (2011) with Imran Khan and Ali Zafar, She was cast as Dimple Dixit, a \"talkative\", \"unpredictable\" girl, a role she described as challenging as the character's personality contrasted with her own. While the film earned mixed reviews, Kaif was generally praised for her portrayal. The book Mother Maiden Mistress called Dimple one of the more interesting female characters of the year and Gaurav Malani of The Economic Times said the film was watchable because of \"Katrina's live-wire energy wherein she never goes overboard and keeps bustling with vivacity through the runtime\". For this performance, Kaif received her second Filmfare nomination in the Best Actress category. In 2012, Kaif appeared in \"Chikni Chameli\", an item number in Agneepath that incorporated dance steps from the Lavani genre (a Maharashtrian folk dance). The song was filmed over a ten-day period and, according to the actress, \"It was hard work. It was very fast and it was not a style I was used to, but I took it as a challenge\". Kaif appeared next in Kabir Khan's espionage thriller Ek Tha Tiger as a Pakistani ISI agent who falls in love with an Indian RAW agent. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote about her performance: \"Katrina is an able, animated foil to Salman, her long legs making her leaps and kicks credible\". The film received predominantly positive reviews, with Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis calling it \"smart and stylish\". With worldwide earnings of \u20b93.1 billion (US$48\u00a0million), Ek Tha Tiger was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. That year Kaif also appeared with Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma in Yash Chopra's swan song, the romance Jab Tak Hai Jaan. About working with Chopra, she remarked that he \"undoubtedly is the king of romance and I have always admired the way he presents his heroines. It was always a dream to work with him and the reality is even better\". She played Meera, a woman who promises God to end her affair with her comatose lover if he survives. Although the film received mostly positive reviews, Kaif's performance had a mixed reception. CNN-IBN wrote: \"Meera's role was a difficult one and Katrina falls short in emotional scenes. It seems Katrina still doesn't feel very easy in front of the camera and has difficulty with complex expressions\". Commercially, the film proved a box-office hit with revenues of \u20b92.11 billion (US$33\u00a0million) worldwide. In 2013, she appeared briefly with Aamir Khan in Vijay Krishna Acharya's action thriller Dhoom 3. To prepare for her role as a circus performer, she undertook a year-long regimen of Pilates, functional training and aerial straps. The film received ambivalent reviews and Kaif was criticised for taking on an insubstantial part. Earning \u20b95.42 billion (US$84\u00a0million) in box-office receipts, Dhoom 3 went on to become the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time until it was surpassed by PK in 2014. Kaif's next appearance was in Siddharth Anand's Bang Bang! (2014), a remake of the 2010 action comedy Knight and Day. She played a bank receptionist who unwittingly gets caught up with a secret agent (Hrithik Roshan). Raja Sen of Rediff.com was disappointed with her performance, describing it as \"insufferable\". Although the film was commercially successful, financial analysts observed that it failed to meet box-office expectations. In 2015, Kaif's sole appearance was with Saif Ali Khan in Kabir Khan's post 26/11 counter-terrorism drama Phantom. In 2016, Kaif appeared in two films. In Abhishek Kapoor's Fitoor, an adaptation of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations, Kaif played a role based on Estella Havisham along with Aditya Roy Kapur and Tabu. Later that year she featured in Nitya Mehra's love story Baar Baar Dekho with Sidharth Malhotra. Both films were critical and commercial failures. In a review for the former, Namrata Joshi wrote: \"Katrina is good so long as she has to just be herself. So she dances, smiles and flirts well, but the minute a dramatic scene comes up, her utter inadequacy as a performer shows.\" As of October 2016, Kaif is filming for Anurag Basu's comedy-mystery film Jagga Jasoos with Ranbir Kapoor. She will also reprise the role of Zoya in Ali Abbas Zafar's Tiger Zinda Hai, the sequel to Ek Tha Tiger opposite Salman Khan. Kaif's personal life has been the subject of extensive media attention. She is reluctant to discuss her romantic life: \"I have always believed that there is life before marriage and after marriage. Before marriage\u00a0... you are termed a single woman and I choose to conduct that part of my life with absolute dignity and discretion\". Although rumours of a relationship with Salman Khan first emerged in 2003, it was not until after their 2010 breakup that Kaif spoke of the affair, calling it her first serious relationship. They have remained friends, and the actress credits Khan with giving her confidence and guidance: He\u2019s had a huge role in my career. There\u2019s no doubt about that. I value his opinion. But as a person, Salman has had the biggest impact on my life. I became friends with him when I was young. And his persona is very strong. If I were to look back and see his impact on my life, it\u2019s been tremendous. The reported reason for their breakup was Kaif's increasing closeness to Ranbir Kapoor during the filming of Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani. Although this was denied by Kaif and Kapoor, the nature of their relationship was scrutinised by the media because they were thought to be involved with others at the time. In August 2013, photographs of Kapoor and Kaif on holiday in Ibiza were leaked by Stardust; the media interpreted this as confirmation of an affair. After the appearance of the photos, Kaif published an open letter to the media saying that she was \"upset, distressed and invaded\" by the breach of privacy. She later acknowledged Kapoor as \"an extremely important part of [her] life\". In February 2016, the media reported that they had broken up. Although Kaif does not own a house in India, she has bought property in London. As a British citizen, she works in India on a visa. Kaif has a close relationship with her family, and the lack of a father figure in her life has given her a sense of responsibility towards them. While Kaif's mother is Christian and her father is Muslim, Kaif was brought up to practise all faiths and says she is a \"firm believer in God\". The Times of India reported in 2009 that she visits Siddhivinayak Temple, Mount Mary Church and the Sufi shrine Dargah Sharif before her films are released. Kaif is involved with Relief Projects India, a charitable trust run by her mother which rescues abandoned baby girls and works to prevent female infanticide. Kaif's winnings from the game shows 10 Ka Dum and Kaun Banega Crorepati were donated to her mother's Mercy Home orphanage. In 2009 and 2010, Kaif also walked the ramp for charity as part of Salman Khan's \"Being Human\" show. To raise funds for a new school in Madurai she recorded Rhyme Skool, an album of nursery rhymes composed by A. R. Rahman. In 2011, Kaif visited sepoys in Jammu as part of NDTV's reality program Jai Jawan. The following year she visited the Cancer Patients Aid Association to gift cancer survivors and increase public awareness of breast and cervical cancer. Kaif has also performed onstage, participating in Shah Rukh Khan's \"Temptations Reloaded\" world concert tour in 2008. Also featuring Kareena Kapoor and Arjun Rampal, the tour began in Amsterdam in June and ended four months later in Dubai's Festival City Arena before an audience of 15,000. Kaif rejoined Shah Rukh Khan for his 2013 \"Temptations Reloaded\" concert in Muscat, performing to an audience of over 18,000. She performed with Akon at the closing ceremony of the 2009 Indian Premier League at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg, and joined Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone and Pitbull in Kolkata for the opening ceremony of the 2013 IPL season. In 2016, she joined other Indian celebrities for the \"Dream Team Tour\", where they performed in various American cities. According to an India Today article, despite her dissimilarity to a conventional Bollywood heroine, Kaif \"turned every adversity into opportunity and climbed the slippery pole of stardom\". Although she is one of the most commercially successful actresses in contemporary Bollywood, she has received mixed reviews for her acting prowess. Writing for Firstpost, Anuya Jakatdar wrote that Kaif needed to \"take on role[s] that actually challenge her\" instead of \"coasting on her co-star\u2019s box office appeal\" and criticised her inclination towards glamorous roles. Kaif's dancing ability is better appreciated, with Meena Iyer of The Times of India calling her \"one of Bollywood's best dancers\". Kaif's Bollywood success has sparked an influx of foreign talent hoping to establish themselves in the industry. Kaif is cited in the media as one of India's most beautiful celebrities, and has ranked highly in polls choosing the most attractive Indian celebrities. Kaif was named the \"World's Sexiest Woman\" by FHM India five times from 2008 to 2013, and appeared on Verve's list of most powerful women in 2009 and 2010. The UK magazine Eastern Eye called her the \"Sexiest Asian Woman\" from 2008 to 2010, and again in 2013. Kaif was named The Times of India's \"Most Desirable Woman\" in 2010, and was later ranked second from 2011 to 2013. The Indian edition of People described her as \"India's Most Beautiful Woman\" in 2011 and three years later she topped Maxim India's \"Hot 100\" poll. Kaif is a celebrity spokesperson for a number of brands including Slice, Nakshatra, Lux, Panasonic, Lakm\u00e9 and L'Or\u00e9al. The Economic Times ranked Kaif India's second most prominent endorser in 2012. Hindustan Times reported in 2014 that she received \u20b950 million (US$770,000) to \u20b960 million (US$930,000) for each endorsement, making her one of India's highest-paid celebrity endorsers. In 2013, Kaif was ranked ninth on Forbes' list of India's best-known entertainers with an estimated annual income of \u20b9637.5 million (US$9.9\u00a0million). In 2010 and 2011, Mattel released two sets of Barbie dolls inspired by Kaif. In 2015, Kaif became the eighth Bollywood actor to have a wax figure installed at Madame Tussauds in London."

        "artist_name": "Konkona_Sen_Sharma", 
        "biography": " Konkona Sen Sharma (born 3 December 1979) is an Indian actress and director. The daughter of veteran filmmaker\u2013actress Aparna Sen, Sensharma appears primarily in Indian arthouse and independent films, and her achievements in the genre have established her as one of the leading actresses of contemporary parallel cinema. Making her debut as a child artist in the film Indira (1983), Sharma debuted as an adult in the Bengali thriller Ek Je Aachhe Kanya (2000). She first gained attention with the English-language film Mr. and Mrs. Iyer (2002), which was directed by her mother, and received the National Film Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film. Her appearance in the drama Page 3 (2005) got her wider recognition from audiences, and she has since starred in a number of films, most of which have garnered her critical praise rather than commercial success. She won two consecutive Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Awards for her performances in Omkara (2006) and Life in a... Metro (2007), respectively. Her performance in the former won her a second National Award under the Best Supporting Actress category. She was the first recipient of the Best Actress award at the Filmfare Awards East for her work in the Bengali film Goynar Baksho (2014).   Sen Sharma was born on 3 December 1979 to Mukul Sharma (a science writer and journalist) and Aparna Sen (an actress and film director). She has an elder sister, Kamalini Chatterjee. Sen Sharma's maternal grandfather, Chidananda Dasgupta, was a film critic, scholar, professor, writer and one of the co-founders of the Calcutta Film Society. Her grandmother Supriya Dasgupta was a cousin of legendary modern Bengali poet Jibanananda Das. Sen Sharma has a degree in English from St Stephen's College, Delhi, which she received in 2001. She was a student of the Modern High School for Girls, Calcutta, as well as the Calcutta International School. Sen Sharma made her debut as a child artist in the Bengali film Indira (1983). In 2000, she made her adult debut in the Bengali film Ek Je Aachhe Kanya, in which she played a negative character. It was followed by a role in Rituparno Ghosh's acclaimed film Titli, opposite Mithun Chakraborty and her mother Aparna Sen. In 2001, she starred in the English-language film Mr. and Mrs. Iyer, directed by Aparna Sen. The film performed well mainly in multiplexes and was a major critical success. Sen Sharma's performance as a Tamil housewife and her mastery of the accent were received well and she was awarded the National Film Award for Best Actress. Her performance was later included in the 2010 issue of the \"Top 80 Iconic Performances\" by Filmfare. \"What's special about her performance as Meenakshi Iyer is not the effort she put into it as much as the apparent lack of it. [...] Be it her squabbling with the urbane photographer Jehangir Chaudhary or her gently reprimanding him about how her name is pronounced (It's Mee-naa-kshi not Minakshi) or even when she is screaming at her infant, you believe it's Meenakshi you\u00b4ve met. And therein lies the key to her iconic performance.\" This was followed by the National Film Award-winning social film, Page 3 (2005). Her role of a smart journalist drew praise and she became a more familiar face to the movie-going public. Sen Sharma was offered the lead role in Mira Nair's Hollywood film, The Namesake (2007), but owing to clashing dates with other films, she could not commit to the project. However, she followed it with acclaimed performances as a mentally ill woman in 15 Park Avenue (2005) and as a middle age village woman in Omkara (2006). For the latter, she received both the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award and the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her next release Deadline: Sirf 24 Ghante (2006) got average reviews. In 2006, Sen Sharma made her directorial debut with an 18-minute Bengali short film titled Naamkoron (Naming Ceremony) for the Kala Ghoda Film Festival. Following this, Sen Sharma acted in Dosar, a Bengali art film by Rituporno Ghosh which was premiered at several international film festivals. She won the Best Actress award at Mahindra Indo-American Arts Council (MIAAC) Film Festival for her performance. Her first release of 2007 was her second collaboration with Madhur Bhandarkar, a noir film named Traffic Signal, in which she played a street prostitute. Later that year, she appeared in Anurag Basu's Life in a... Metro. The film opened to positive reviews and performed well at the Indian box office. Metro depicted the lives of different individuals in Mumbai, and Sen Sharma's performance as a young and insecure woman earned her a second Filmfare Award. In late 2007, Sen Sharma acted in two movies under the Yash Raj Films banner. She noted her excitement toward these two projects as these were the first films in which she had to lip-sync for songs. In the first one, Laaga Chunari Mein Daag, a drama directed by Pradeep Sarkar, she portrayed the character of a Banaras small town young woman, Chutki, alongside Rani Mukerji. The film was a critical and commercial failure in India, even though her performance was received well. The second one was Aaja Nachle, which was widely promoted as the comeback film of Madhuri Dixit. The film did not do well. Rajeev Masand from CNN-IBN noted her performance in the film as being \"...nothing short of fantastic. Her greatest strength is that she isn't afraid of making a fool of herself and she doesn't worry about being laughed at. As a result, her performance in Aaja Nachle is fearless and uninhibited.\" In 2008, Sen Sharma starred in Dil Kabaddi. She starred in a short film (How Can It Be?) directed by Mira Nair for a movie project called 8, which was screened at several film festivals in 2008 before having a theatrical release.

        "biography": " Manoj Tuli (born 11 July 1960), better known as Kumar Gaurav, is an Indian film actor and son of late actor Rajendra Kumar. He has acted in several hit films such as Love Story, Teri Kasam, Naam, Indrajeet and Kaante.   Gaurav was born as 'Manoj Tuli' on 11 July 1960. He studied at the Bishop Cotton School in Simla. His father, Rajendra Kumar, was a popular actor in the 1960s and 1970s. Rajendra Kumar died of cancer in 1999. While shooting for his debut movie, Love Story with Vijayta Pandit, the duo got romantically involved. The relationship later came to an end as tensions arose between the Pandit and Kumar families. In 1984, Gaurav married Namrata Dutt, daughter of Sunil Dutt and Nargis and sister of actor Sanjay Dutt. The couple has two daughters, Saachi and Siya. Saachi is married to Bilal Amrohi, the grandson of filmmaker Kamal Amrohi. Gaurav and his brother-in-law Sanjay Dutt worked together in two films, Naam and Kaante. He made his film debut with Love Story (1981). This film played at the box office for a long period of time; not only for its innovative story, but also its music and the debutants. Many youngsters began to emulate his character in the film, produced by his father and directed by Rahul Rawail which was a blockbuster. His next film, the 1982 release Teri Kasam with actress Poonam Dhillon, another heart-throb of the generation, was a moderate success. That same year he starred in the musical Star which failed at the box office but its music was popular. He then worked in Mahesh Bhatt's Janam in (1985). His understated performance in this film is still considered his career's best. In the following year he had his second box office hit with Naam (1986), again a Mahesh Bhatt film which was produced by his father and also starred his brother-in-law Sanjay Dutt in the lead role. Despite the success of Naam, Gaurav's career declined as all of his subsequent films failed to do well at the box office. He has been successfully paired with almost all young ladies of \u201980s \u2013 Poonam Dillon, Rati Agnihotri, Neelam, Vijeyta Pandit, Madhuri Dixit and Padmini Kolhapure. Yet his pairing with Vijeyta Pandit in their debut movie is still remembered most. His revival project, Phool with the top actress Madhuri Dixit, couldn\u2019t give success though its melodious songs were noticed. Having produced his earlier films Janam and Naam, his father tried to revive his career with the 1993 film Phool which also had his father and father-in-law Sunil Dutt in supporting roles. However, it didn't bring him any luck either. He took a long break from acting in the mid 1990s. In 2000, he returned to films with the delayed release Gang which had been in production for nearly a decade. In 2002, he played one of the six protagonists in the crime thriller Kaante, directed by Sanjay Gupta and a remake of the Hollywood hit Reservoir Dogs (1992). Kaante was a huge success at the box office and the third highest-grossing film of 2002. In 2004 he appeared in his first American film, Guiana 1838. This award winning film by Rohit Jagessar grossed the highest screen average at the North American box office on opening weekend and is among the Top 25 all-time highest screen average charts. Guiana 1838 tells the story of Indians arriving in the British colony of British Guiana, now Guyana, as indentured servants amidst the abolition of slavery during the nineteenth century. In 2009, he starred in the silent film My Daddy Strongest."

        "artist_name": "Madhubala", 
        "biography": " Mumtaz Jehan Dehlavi Madhubala (14 February 1933 \u2013 23 February 1969) (born Mumtaz Jehan Dehlavi) was an Indian film actress who appeared in classic films of Hindi cinema. She was active between 1942 and 1960. Along with her contemporaries Nargis and Meena Kumari, she is often regarded as one of the most influential personalities of Hindi cinema. She is also considered to be one of the most beautiful actresses to have worked in the industry and is highly regarded as \"The Venus of Indian Cinema\" and \"The Beauty with Tragedy\". Often drawing comparison from American actress Marilyn Monroe, Madhubala received wide recognition for her performances in films like Mahal (1949), Amar (1954), Mr. & Mrs. '55 (1955), Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958), Mughal-e-Azam (1960) and Barsaat Ki Raat (1960). Madhubala's performance in Mughal-e-Azam established her as an iconic actress of Hindi Cinema. Her last film, Jwala, although shot in the 1950s, was released in 1971. Madhubala died on 23 February 1969 after a prolonged illness.   Madhubala was born Mumtaz Jehan Dehlavi, on 14 February 1933 in Delhi, India. She was a native Pashto-speaker. Her father was Attaullah Khan, a Yusufzai Pashtun from the Swabi District of North-West Frontier Province(modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan), and her mother was Ayesha Begum. She belonged to a Muslim family and was the fifth of eleven children. After her father lost his job at the Imperial Tobacco Company in Peshawar, he relocated to Delhi followed by Mumbai. There, the family endured many hardships. Madhubala's three sisters and two brothers died at the age of five and six. The dock explosion and fire of April 14, 1944 wiped out their small home. The family survived only because they had gone to see a film at a local theater. With his six remaining daughters to provide for, Khan, and the young Madhubala, began to pay frequent visits to Bombay film studios to look for work. At the age of 9, this was Madhubala's introduction to the movie industry, which would provide financial help to her family. Madhubala's first movie, Basant (1942), was a box-office success. She acted as the daughter to a mother played by actress Mumtaz Shanti. As a child actress she went on to play in several movies. Actress Devika Rani was impressed by her performance and potential, and advised her to assume the screen name 'Madhubala', literally meaning \"honey belle\". Her first lead role, at the age of 14, was with producer Kidar Sharma when he cast her opposite Raj Kapoor in Neel Kamal (1947). This was the last film in which she was credited as Mumtaz before assuming her screen name 'Madhubala'. She achieved stardom and popularity in 1949 when she was cast as the lead in Bombay Talkies studio's Mahal \u2013 a role intended for well-known star Suraiya. Madhubala, with established actresses, screen-tested for the role before she was selected by the film's director Kamal Amrohi. The film was the third largest hit at the 1949 Indian box office. Following the success of Mahal, Madhubala appeared in the box office hits Dulari (1949), Beqasoor (1950), Tarana (1951) and Badal (1951). In the early 1950s, as Madhubala became one of the most sought-after actresses in India, she attracted interest from Hollywood. She appeared in the American magazine Theatre Arts where, in its August 1952 issue, she was featured in an article with a full page photograph under the title: \"The Biggest Star in the World - and she's not in Beverly Hills\". The article described Madhubala's immense popularity in India, and explored her wide appeal and large fan base. It also speculated on her potential international success. Academy Award winner American director Frank Capra, while visiting Bombay for International Film Festival of India, was keen to give her a break in Hollywood, but her father Ataullah Khan declined. Madhubala's co-stars Ashok Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Rehman, Pradeep Kumar, Shammi Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Sunil Dutt and Dev Anand were the most popular of the period. She also appeared with Kamini Kaushal, Suraiya, Geeta Bali, Nalini Jaywant, Shyama and Nimmi, notable leading ladies. The directors she worked with, Mehboob Khan (Amar), Guru Dutt (Mr. & Mrs. '55), Kamal Amrohi (Mahal) and K. Asif (Mughal-e-Azam), were amongst the most prolific and respected. Madhubala also became a producer with the film Naata (1955), in which she also acted. She also produced Mahlon Ke Khwab (1960) and acted in it During the 1950s, Madhubala took starring roles in almost every genre of film being made at the time. Her 1950 film Hanste Aansoo was the first ever Hindi film to get an \"A\" \u2013 adults only \u2013 rating from the Central Board of Film Certification. She was the archetypal fair lady in the swashbuckler Badal (1951), and following this, an uninhibited village beauty in Tarana (1951). She played the traditional ideal of Indian womanhood in Sangdil (1952), and produced a comic performance as the spoilt heiress, Anita, in Guru Dutt's satire Mr. & Mrs. '55 (1955). In 1956, she acted in costume dramas such as Shirin-Farhad and Raj-Hath, and played a double role in the social drama Kal Hamara Hai (1959). In the mid-1950s, her films including the major ones like Mehboob Khan's Amar (1954) did not do well commercially. However, she bounced back between 1958 and 1960 when she starred in a series of hit films. These include Howrah Bridge, opposite Ashok Kumar where she played the role of an Anglo-Indian Cabaret singer involved in Calcutta's Chinatown underworld. In the song Aaiye Meherebaan from this film, she lip-synced a torch song dubbed by Asha Bhosle which has remained popular to this day. Among other successful films, she played opposite Bharat Bhushan in Phagun; Dev Anand in Kala Pani; Kishore Kumar in Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi; and Bharat Bushan again in Barsaat Ki Raat (1960). Then in 1960, she appeared in the magnum opus Mughal-e-Azam. Madhubala acted in as many as seventy films from 1947 to 1964, and only fifteen of which were box office successes. Dilip Kumar regrets that \"(h)ad she lived, and had she selected her films with more care, she would have been far superior to her contemporaries ...\" Kumar also points out that \"actresses those days faced a lot of difficulties and constraints in their career. Unable to assert themselves too much, they fell back on their families who became their caretakers and defined everything for them.\" It was the film Mughal-e-Azam that marked what many consider to be Madhubala's greatest and definitive characterization, as the doomed courtesan, Anarkali. Although the film took nine years to complete, it was not until 1953 when Madhubala was finally chosen for the role. Bunny Reuben in his Book Dilip Kumar: Star Legend of Indian Cinema claimed that Dilip Kumar's role was instrumental behind this selection. Mughal-e-Azam gave Madhubala the opportunity of fulfilling herself totally as an actress, for it was a role that all actresses dreamt of playing, as Nimmi acknowledges that \"as an actress, one gets a lot of roles, there is no shortage of them, but there isn\u2019t always good scope for acting. With Mughal-e-Azam, Madhubala showed the world just what she could do.\" However, by the late 1950s, her health was deteriorating rapidly, and director K. Asif, probably unaware of the extent of Madhubala's illness, required long shooting schedules that made physical demands on her, whether it was posing as a veiled statue in suffocating make-up for hours under the studio lights or being shackled with heavy chains. It was also a time when Madhubala's relationship with Dilip Kumar was fading out, and \"the lives of Madhubala and her screen character are consistently seen as overlapping, it is because of the overwhelming sense of loss and tragedy and the unrelenting diktat of destiny that clung to both and which neither could escape\". Mughal-e-Azam was released on 5 August 1960, and became the highest-grossing film at that time, a record that went unbroken for 15 years until the release of the film Sholay in 1975. Madhubhala was nominated for a Filmfare Award for her performance in Mughal-e-Azam. In 1960, Madhubala was at the peak of her career and popularity with the release of Mughal-e-Azam and Barsaat Ki Raat. She did have intermittent releases in the early 1960s. Some of these, like Jhumroo (1961), Half Ticket (1962) and Sharabi (1964), performed above average at the box-office. However, most of her other films released during this time were marred by her absence and subsequent lack of completion due to her prolonged illness. These films suffer from compromised editing, and in some cases the use of \"doubles\" in an attempt to patch-in scenes that Madhubala was unable to shoot. Her last released film Jwala, although filmed in the late 1950s, was not issued until 1971. In their 1962 book Self-Portrait, Harish Booch and Karing Doyle commented that \"unlike other stars, Madhubala prefers a veiled secrecy around her and is seldom seen in social gatherings or public functions\" (p.\u00a076), and went on to say that \"contrary to general belief, Madhubala is rather simple and unassuming\" (p.\u00a078). This is echoed in Madhubala's sister's interview with the Filmfare: \"(Madhubala) became a craze because she was never seen in public. She wasn\u2019t allowed to attend any function, any premiere. She had no friends. But she never resisted, she was obedient. Being protective, my father earned the reputation of being domineering\". Dilip Kumar added, \"She was extremely popular ... and I think the only star for whom people thronged outside the gates. Very often when shooting was over, there\u2019d be a vast crowd standing at the gates just to have a look at Madhu ... It wasn\u2019t so for anyone else. That was her personal effect on fans. Her personality was vivacious.\" But, \"she was aware of her beauty,\" reminisces B. K. Karanjia, former Filmfare editor and a close friend of both Madhubala and her father, \"and because there were so many in love with her, she used to play one against the other. But it was out of innocence rather than shrewd calculation.\" Dev Anand recalled in a similar way: \"she liked to flirt innocently and was great fun.\" However, with Dilip Kumar she had a long association. Dilip Kumar and Madhubala first met on the set of 'Jwar Bhata' (1944 film), and worked together again on the film 'Har Singaar'(1949), which was shelved. Their relationship began two years later during the filming of 'Tarana (1951 film. They became a romantic pair appearing in a total of four films together. Actor Shammi Kapoor recalled that \"Dilip Kumar would drive down from Bombay to meet Madhubala ... she was committed to Dilip ... he even flew to Bombay to spend Eid with her, taking time off from his shooting stint ...\" \"They even got engaged\", said Madhubala's sister. But, Madhubala's father Ataullah Khan did not give them permission to marry. Dilip Kumar said, \"She was a very, very obedient daughter\", and who, in spite of the success, fame and wealth, submitted to the domination of her father and more often than not paid for his mistakes. \"This inability to leave her family was her greatest drawback\", believed Shammi Kapoor, \"for it had to be done at some time.\" The Naya Daur (1957 film) court case happened in 1956 when Dilip Kumar testified against Madhubala and her father in favor of the director B.R. Chopra in open court. This struck a fatal blow to the Dilip-Madhubala relationship as it ended any chance of reconciliation between Dilip Kumar and Madhubala'a father. Reflecting on this, while Dilip Kumar said he was \"trapped\", Shammi Kapoor felt \"this was something which went beyond him (Dilip) and he couldn\u2019t control the whole situation ...\"  However, Madhubala's sister Madhur Bhushan claimed that \"(Madhubala) said she would marry him (Dilip), provided he apologised to her father. He refused, so Madhubala left him. That one 'sorry' could have changed her life.\" Madhubala married Kishore Kumar in 1960 after Kishore Kumar converted to Islam and took up the name Karim Abdul, and according to Leena Chandavarkar (Kishore's fourth wife): \"When she realized Dilip was not going to marry her, on the rebound and just to prove to him that she could get whomsoever she wanted, she went and married a man she did not even know properly.\" B. K. Karanjia assumed that \"Madhubala may have felt that perhaps this was her best chance\" because by this time she became seriously ill, and was about to stop working completely; however, he added that \"it was a most unlikely union, and not a happy one either.\"  Madhubala's illness was known to Kishore, but like all the others, he did not realize its gravity; Ataullah Khan did not approve of his son-in-law at all, but he had lost the courage to disapprove. Ashok Kumar reminisced in a Filmfare interview: \"She suffered a lot and her illness made her very bad-tempered. She often fought with Kishore, and would take off to her father's house where she spent most of her time.\" Madhubala's sister echoes this view albeit in a slightly different tone: \"After marriage they flew to London where the doctor told her she had only two years to live. After that Kishore left her at our house saying, \u2018I can\u2019t look after her. I\u2019m on outdoors often\u2019. But she wanted to be with him. He\u2019d visit her once in two months though. Maybe he wanted to detach himself from her so that the final separation wouldn\u2019t hurt. But he never abused her as was reported. He bore her medical expenses. They remained married for nine years.\" However, Madhubala's love-life continued to be the subject of media speculation. Mohan Deep wrote an unofficial biography of Madhubala titled Mystery and Mystique of Madhubala, published in 1996, where he claims that Kishore Kumar regularly whipped Madhubala, who would show her lashes to Shakti Samanta. Mohan Deep also questions whether Madhubala was really ill or whether her ailing was a fiction. Shammi Kapoor, a long-term colleague of Madhubala, refuted Mohan Deep's claims, which he described as being \"in bad taste\". Paidi Jairaj, and Shakti Samanta, both of whom worked with Madhubala, rejected Deep's biography emphasizing the glaring difference between fact and fiction, and film journalist M.S.M. Desai, who had worked as a journalist on Madhubala's sets, questioned Deep's method of research saying, \"Mohan Deep was not around at the time of Madhubala, so how is he capable of writing about her without resorting to hearsay?\". Madhubala had ventricular septal defect (a hole in her heart) which was detected while she was shooting for Bahut Din Huwe in Madras in 1954. By 1960, her condition aggravated, and her sister explains that \"due to her ailment, her body would produce extra blood. So it would spill out from the nose and mouth. The doctor would come home and extract bottles of blood. She also suffered from pulmonary pressure of the lungs. She coughed all the time. Every four to five hours she had to be given oxygen or else would get breathless. She was confined to bed for nine years and was reduced to just bones and skin\". In 1966, with a slight improvement in her health, she made a valiant attempt to complete her work in Chalak opposite Raj Kapoor, which needed only a short spell of shooting, but she could not even survive that strain. When acting was no longer an option Madhubala turned her attention to film direction. In 1969 she was set to make her directorial debut with the film Farz aur Ishq. However the film was never made as during pre-production, she died on February 23, 1969, shortly after her 36th birthday. Her tomb was built with marble and inscriptions included aayats from the Quran and verse dedications. Controversially, her tomb was demolished in 2010 to make space for new graves. Madhubala's strong presence in the public memory has been evidenced by all recent polls about top actresses or beauties of the Indian cinema. Every year, on her birthday, numerous articles are printed and television programmes aired to commemorate her, to the present day. Her posters are still in demand and sold alongside contemporary actresses, and modern magazines continue to publish stories on her personal life and career, often promoting her name heavily on the covers to attract sales. Many believe, however, Madhubala remains one of the most underrated actresses as \"her beauty attracted more attention than her talent.\" In 2004, a digitally-colorized version of the original Mughal-e-Azam was released, 35 years after her death. In 2012, her 1962 release Half Ticket was also remastered, digitally coloured and re-released. On March 18, 2008, a commemorative postage stamp featuring Madhubala was issued. The stamp was produced by India Post in a limited edition presentation pack. It was launched by veteran actors Nimmi and Manoj Kumar in a ceremony attended by colleagues, friends and surviving members of Madhubala's family. The only other Indian film actress that was honoured in this manner was Nargis Dutt, at that point of time."

In addition to acting in films, Dixit has featured as a talent judge for four seasons of the dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa. She has participated in several stage shows and has engaged in philanthropic activities. She is married to the Dr. Shriram Madhav Nene, with whom she has two children.   Dixit is a native of Mumbai, India. She was born on 15 May 1967 in a Maharashtrian family to Shankar and Snehlata Dixit. Dixit attended Divine Child High School and Mumbai University and studied to be a microbiologist. She always desired dance since the age of 3 and went on to practice the art of kathak and later on to become a trained professional Kathak dancer. Dixit made her acting debut in Rajshri Productions' movie Abodh in 1984 opposite the Bengali actor, Tapas Paul. The film failed to do well but Dixit earned positive reviews from critics. Aakash Barvalia on Gomolo praised her as he wrote \"Madhuri excels in her role as a young naive bride who acquits herself well as the naive village girl and does not realize what marriage actually entails.\" Her only release of 1985 was Awara Baap that turned out to be another failure for Dixit. In 1986, Dixit starred in two movies, Swati and Manav Hatya but both films flopped at the box office. Dixit had three releases in 1987 with Mohre, Hifazat and Uttar Dakshin but her films continued to flop at the box office. Among Dixit's three releases of 1988, first two of them - Dayavan and Khatron Ke Khiladi- too failed to do well commercially. Dixit finally attained stardom after a series of consecutive flops when she landed the lead female role of Mohini in N. Chandra's romantic thriller Tezaab opposite Anil Kapoor. The film went on to become that year's highest-grossing movie. It was Dixit's first commercial success and her earliest of several collaborations with Kapoor. Akshay Shah of Planet Bollywood praised Dixit for her dancing skills and her acting was also praised. He wrote \"Mahduri Dixit gives a fine tuned performance. Though she is more remembered for her crowd pleasing dance act Ek Do Teen, her acting needs to be noted, specially in the scenes where she is pitted against Anupam Kher. She looks and dances like a dream.\" Dixit received her first nomination for the Filmfare Best Actress Award for her work in Tezaab. In 1989, her first release was Subhash Ghai's drama Ram Lakhan, in which she was paired once again with Anil Kapoor. The film became a super-hit and went on to become the second highest-grossing film of the year. Dixit's next release, the critically acclaimed romantic drama Prem Pratigyaa, in which she starred opposite Mithun Chakraborty, failed to do well commercially. However, critics were appreciative of her portrayal and she received her second nomination for the Filmfare Best Actress Award. Thereafter Dixit got success in Rajiv Rai's multi-starrer action thrillerTridev, in which she starred alongside Naseeruddin Shah, Jackie Shroff, Sunny Deol, Sangeeta Bijlani, Sonam and Amrish Puri. Dixit was paired with Deol. The movie became the year's third highest-grossing film. Dixit continued her success with her fourth pairing with Anil Kapoor in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's drama Parinda. Although Dixit's role was small, she received praise for her work. Aniket Joshi has praised her as he wrote \"Madhuri Dixit, the only female character in the film, has a small role as Paro (Karan\u00b4s love interest and Prakash\u00b4s sister) yet still does well in the few scenes she has.\" In 1990, Dixit starred in the romantic drama Dil opposite Aamir Khan. She played the role of a rich and arrogant girl who falls in love with a poorer boy and later leaves her home to marry him. The film became the biggest box-office hit of the year in India and Dixit's performance earned her the first Filmfare Best Actress Award of her career. She was also seen in the dramas Sailaab opposite Aditya Pancholi and Kishen Kanhaiya opposite Anil Kapoor; the former flopped while the latter went on to become the third biggest hit of the year. After the success of Dil, Dixit became one of the leading actresses of Bollywood. The following year, she starred in the super-hit movie Saajan opposite Salman Khan and Sanjay Dutt. The movie became the year's highest-grossing movie. Dixit's performance earned her the fourth nomination for the Filmfare Best Actress Award. In 1992, Dixit featured in the film Beta opposite Anil Kapoor. Dixit's performance of Saraswati, a woman married to an illiterate, well-meaning man who exposes her scheming mother-in-law earned her critical acclaim. Upperstall.com praised Dixit's work \"She made Beta her own film totally stealing a march over the film's hero, Anil Kapoor. While the highlight of the film was undoubtedly Dhak Dhak Karne Laga \u2013 probably the sexiest and most popular dance of Madhuri's career, her blazing performance \u2013 that of a woman married to an illiterate, well-meaning man and who exposes her scheming mother-in-law whom her husband dotes on \u2013 had film reviewers gushing with several people jokingly saying the film should have been called Beti instead!\" Dixit's performance in Beta won her a second Filmfare Best Actress Award. Following the film's success, Dixit became famously known as the \"Dhak Dhak Girl\" for her performance in the famous song \"Dhak Dhak Karne Laga\". In 1993, Dixit starred in the controversial super-hit Khalnayak opposite Sanjay Dutt and Jackie Shroff. Her portrayal of the police officer Ganga earned her critical acclaim. Shahid Khan of Planet Bollywood praised Dixit's dancing and acting skills in the movie \"In any other film, the heroine would not have much to do with a plot like this. So immense is the star-power of Madhuri Dixit that Subhash Ghai actually carved out a solid role for her in this macho tale of a bad boy and his shenanigans. She gives real competition to Sanjay Dutt. The audiences ran in their droves to witness the Madhuri Dixit magic. In every scene, she holds you captive with her stunning beauty, demanding screen presence, expressive acting and excellent dancing skills. Saroj Khan\u2019s dance choreography is entertaining to watch, particularly in \"Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai\". Madhuri\u2019s entrance is a riot with a prison inmate asking her, \"Kaisi aurat hai tu? (What kind of a woman are you?)\u201d and she responds by slapping her and saying, \"Aisi aurat hoon main! (This is the kind of woman I am!)\u201d.\" Dixit's performance in Khalnayak earned her a sixth nomination for the Filmfare Best Actress Award and became the year's second highest grossing film. In 1994, Dixit starred in Anjaam, being paired with Shahrukh Khan for the first time. Dixit's performance of a revenge-seeking wife and mother earned her a seventh nomination for the Filmfare Best Actress Award. Dixit was praised for her performance, though the film was a below average performer at the box office. Her next starring role was in the film Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! opposite Salman Khan. The film became one of the biggest hits in the history of Hindi cinema and made \u20b9 1.35\u00a0billion worldwide, breaking the record of the film Sholay (1975). It became the highest grossing Bollywood film in Hindi cinema history after its theatrical run and held the record for 7 years till the release of Gadar: Ek Prem Katha (2001). Dixit's role of a modern yet family-oriented young girl fetched her the third Filmfare Best Actress Award of her career. Critics believed the film to be \"too sweet\" but appreciated Dixit's performance as she mesmerised on the screen. In the Millennium Edition of the \"Guinness Book of World Records\", Hum Aapke Hain Kaun became the Bollywood's highest-grossing film. Upperstall.com wrote \"Madhuri Dixit, reunited with the banner that launched her, stands out and is undoubtedly the life of the film as Nisha. Be it the mischievous but strong-minded, independent girl who gives it to Prem as good as she gets or the woman willing to sacrifice her love believing she is doing the right thing, Madhuri is absolutely spot on creating one of the more memorable female characters of Hindi Cinema.\" 1995 saw Dixit star in the hit Raja opposite Sanjay Kapoor. The film became the fourth highest grosser of the year and its success was attributed to her immense popularity. Her next release was David Dhawan's Yaraana opposite Rishi Kapoor, in which she played a dancer on the run from her abusive lover. This film was a below average performer at the box office. Both films earned her nominations for the Filmfare Best Actress Award. Dixit's career went into a slump during 1996 as films like Prem Granth and Rajkumar flopped at the box office. In 1997, Dixit bounced back with Prakash Jha's Mrityudand, in which she performed opposite Shabana Azmi and Shilpa Shirodkar. Dixit played the role of Ketki, one of the three troubled women and earned immense critical acclaim for her performance. Upperstall.com wrote \"Madhuri gives a wonderful, insightful performance as the self-respecting educated woman married into a family of male chauvinistic upper class landlords and who is humiliated by her husband when she objects to his misdeeds, never hitting a false note. She more than matches up to seasoned artists like Shabana and Om Puri in their scenes together. In a word, she is mesmerizing.\" Dixit starred in Yash Chopra's musical romance Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), opposite Shahrukh Khan and Karisma Kapoor. Her role of a woman faced with a moral dilemma in a love triangle, fetched her fourth Filmfare Best Actress Award.[citation needed] The film also proved to be a success at the box-office. However, her career then went to a decline with films like Wajood (1998) and Aarzoo (1999) sinking at the box-office. In 2000, Dixit starred in Rajkumar Santoshi's Pukar opposite Anil Kapoor. A love story based on the backdrop of Indian Army, the film was shot over the course of 350 days. Dixit's portrayal of a negative role in it earned her twelfth nomination for the Filmfare Best Actress Award. She then played the title character in Gaja Gamini, the first feature film directed by painter M. F. Husain. Hussain was fixated with Dixit, and watched her Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! several times, and was certain that he would make a film only with her. He directed it at the age of 85. The film followed the story of Gaja Gamini, who appears in her various incarnations as Mona Lisa, Shakuntala and others. The former film was an average grosser, while the latter bombed at the box-office. In 2001, Dixit starred in Deepak Shivdasani's love triangle Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ke opposite Ajay Devgan and Preity Zinta. Dixit followed up by reuniting with Rajkumar Santoshi in the multi-starrer Lajja (2001). Dealing with the issue of gender inequality, Dixit played the role of a stage player in it. Anita Bora of Rediff.com wrote \"Madhuri slips into her role as Janaki [..] with consummate ease.\" and \"..dazzles us with a class act.\" The film was a box-office failure in India but was an overseas success. Dixit was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for Lajja. In 2002, Dixit starred in a lead role in the love triangle Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam opposite Shahrukh Khan and Salman Khan. A remake of its director K. S. Adhiyaman own Tamil film Thotta Chinungi (1995), the film took six years in making, with huge sabbaticals in between shoots due to several production problems. Few critics noted that the delay made the film look outdated. Dixit's next release was Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period romance Devdas, co-starring Shahrukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai. It was based on the Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel of the same name. She portrayed Chandramukhi, a courtesan who is in love with the title character. Sita Menon of Rediff.com wrote: \"The most understated role and perhaps the one that is most lingering, in terms of virtuosity, is that played by Madhuri Dixit. As Chandramukhi, she is simply stunning, lending passion, fire and gentleness with such consummate ease that watching her perform is sheer delight.\" The film was screened at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and was featured by Time in their listing of the \"10 best films of the millennium\". The film emerged as a major international success with revenues of over \u20b9530 million (US$8.2\u00a0million). Devdas was chosen as India's official entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and received a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. Dixit won the Filmfare Best supporting actress award for the film. It turned out to be her last film for a while as she shifted to Denver with her family. The following year a film named after her, Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon, was released in which a woman (played by Antara Mali) aspires to become the new Madhuri Dixit by trying her luck in Bollywood. Dixit, also made her first appearance on television as a host for the India's first reality show Kahin Na Kahin Koi Hai on Sony TV. In 2006, Dixit returned to India with her family, and acted in cinematographer Anil Mehta's dance film Aaja Nachle (2007). It was her first released in five years, where she played the role of a choreographer. The film was a box-office failure, but Dixit's role was appreciated by critics. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN criticised the plot, while wrote about Dixit's performance: \"It\u2019s hard to take your eyes off the screen when she\u2019s up there, dazzling you with her spontaneity, her easy charm and her 100-watt smile.\" Her performance earned her nomination for the Filmfare Best Actress Award. In 2011, Dixit was felicitated with the Filmfare Special Award for completing 25 years in the film industry. Dixit returned to India in 2012, and made her acting comeback after seven years with the black comedy Dedh Ishqiya (2014). It was a sequel to Ishqiya (2010), where she was cast as con-woman \"Begum Para\" opposite Naseeruddin Shah, Arshad Warsi and Huma Qureshi. Dixit expressed that she agreed to do the film because of the \u201cunapologetic way\u201d its director Abhishek Chaubey presented Vidya Balan\u2019s character\" in Ishqiya. The film opened to positive response from critics who called it \"one of the year's most important releases\". Anupama Chopra called Dixit as \"compelling\", while Deepanjana Pal of Firstpost wrote: \"She's still capable of keeping an audience glued to their seats when the credits start rolling, all because she's dancing on screen.\". The film earned her fourteenth nomination for Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Her next release of the year was the dedutant director Soumik Sen's Gulaab Gang, alongside Juhi Chawla. Dixit portrayed Rajjo, the leader of a women activist group, the film and her role were inspired from the real vigilante activist Sampat Pal Devi and her group Gulabi Gang. Pal filed a case against the film claiming the makers did not take permission to make a film on her life, the court later lifted the stay from the film. To prepare for her role, Dixit practised Shaolin Kung fu, stick training, and close combat. Gulaab Gang failed at the box office, earning mixed reviews. Subhash K. Jha labelled Dixit's performance and demeanour \"inconsistent\". Although Sampat Pal claimed that in Dixit's character she finds a \"reflection of her own life so stark\" that it makes her feel \"it was she on screen\". Dixit is not only known for her acting skills, but for her dancing skills as well. Often referred to as the \"Dhak Dhak Girl\", she is famous for her dance in the song \"Dhak Dhak Karne Laga\" from the film Beta.

Pandit Birju Maharaj, a Kathak dancer, who choreographed Dixit in the film Devdas for the song \"Kaahe Chhed\", calls her as \"the best Bollywood dancer due to her versatility.\" Film critic Raja Sen describes Dixit as \"the industry's numero uno in every sense.\" Further he elaborates, \"She is an exemplary dancer. From Kathak to Dhak Dhak, she's done it all and wowed us every step of the way.\" Saroj Khan, who choreographer most of Dixit's early hits, after working with her again in Gulaab Gang called her, \"choreographer's delight\".

During the making of Saajan in 1990, Madhuri had an affair with Sanjay Dutt who was married at the time to Richa Sharma. Despite her father's objections, the relationship continued. However, with Dutt's arrest under TADA in 1993, Madhuri ended the relationship. Talking about this break-up, film journalist Bharati Pradhan reported in The Telegraph that \"Madhuri had always been a clean player. A Dutt-Dixit alliance would\u2019ve been disastrous and she was too sensible not to see it.\" On 17 October 1999, Dixit married Dr. Shriram Madhav Nene, a cardiovascular surgeon from Los Angeles, California. They have two sons, Arin (b. March 2003) and Rayaan (b. March 2005). After her marriage, Dixit relocated to Denver, Colorado, for almost a decade. She moved back to Mumbai with her family in October 2011. Dixit has been the muse for the Indian painter M. F. Husain. He was so fascinated by Dixit in Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! that he watched the film 67 times, and in 2007 he booked an entire theatre to see her comeback movie Aaja Nachle. He made a series of paintings of her, and in 2000 made a film named Gaja Gamini starring her, which was intended as a tribute to Dixit herself. Dixit has always been a passionate dancer, and therefore turned her passion into reality by opening her own online dance academy \"Dance With Madhuri\", where her fans have a one-to-one lesson to learn some of her most famous and well known dance numbers."

        "artist_name": "Mala_Sinha", 
        "biography": " Mala Sinha (born 11 November 1936 in Calcutta, India) is a former Bollywood actress who has worked in Hindi, Bengali and Nepali films. Recognised for her talent and beauty, she went on to become a top leading actress in Hindi films from the mid 1950s until the late 1970s. Sinha has starred in over a hundred film productions: popular ones include Pyaasa (1957), Anpadh, Dil Tera Deewana (both 1962), Gumrah (1963), Himalaya Ki God Mein (1965), Aankhen (1968), Maryada and Babu.   Mala Sinha's father Albert Sinha was a Bengali Christian, while her mother was of Nepali origin. Her father's name was Albert Sinha. Mala's initial name was Alda. Her friends at school in Calcutta (now Kolkata) used to tease her by calling her Dalda (a brand of vegetable oil), so she changed her name to Baby Nazma on getting her first assignment as a child artiste. Later on, as an adult actor, she changed her name to Mala Sinha. In her childhood she learnt dancing and singing. Although she was an approved singer of All India Radio, she has never done playback singing in films. But as a singer she has done stage shows in many languages from 1947 to 1975. Sinha started her career as child artist in Bengali films Jai Vaishno Devi followed by Shri Krishan Leela, Jog Biyog and Dhooli. Noted Bengali director Ardhendu Bose saw her acting in a school play and took permission from her father to cast her as a heroine in his film Roshanara (1952), her cinematic debut. After acting in a couple of films in Calcutta, Mala had to go to Bombay for a Bengali film. There she met Geeta Bali, a noted Bollywood actress, who was charmed by her and introduced her to director Kidar Sharma. Sharma cast her as a heroine in his Rangeen Ratein. Her first Hindi film was Badshah opposite Pradeep Kumar, then came Ekadashi, a mythological film. Both failed, but her lead role in Kishore Sahu's Hamlet, paired opposite Pradeep Kumar, fetched her rave reviews in spite of it failing at the box office. Films like Lai Batti (actor Balraj Sahni\u2019s only directorial venture), Nausherwan-E-Adil where she starred as the fair maiden Marcia in Sohrab Modi\u2019s romance about forbidden love and Phir Subah Hogi, which was director Ramesh Saigal\u2019s adaptation of Dosteovsky\u2019s Crime and Punishment established Mala Sinha's reputation as a versatile actress who took the maximum career risks by accepting unconventional roles. Mala was a singer of some repute and used to sing for All India Radio; she was not allowed to sing playback (even for herself) in the movies with the lone exception being 1972's Lalkar. In the 1950s, she had string of hits opposite Pradeep Kumar like Fashion (1957), Detective (1958), Duniya Na Mane (1959). The films she did with Pradeep Kumar were men-oriented. In 1957, noted Bollywood actor and director Guru Dutt (the husband of Geeta Dutt) cast Mala in his film Pyaasa (1957) in a role originally intended for Madhubala. Mala gave a memorable performance as the relatively unsympathetic part of an ambitious woman who chooses to marry a rich man (played by actor Rehman) and have a loveless marriage rather than a poor, unsuccessful poet and her impoverished lover (played by Guru Dutt) whom she ditches. Pyaasa remains to this day a classic in the history of Indian cinema and a turning point for Sinha. After Pyaasa her major success were Phir Subah Hogi (1958) and Yash Chopra's directorial debut Dhool Ka Phool (1959) that elevated her into a major dramatic star. She was part of many successful movies from 1958 to the early '60s like Parvarish (1958), Ujala, Main Nashe Main Hoon, Duniya Na Mane, Love Marriage (1959), Bewaqoof (1960), Maya (1961), Hariyali Aur Rasta and Dil Tera Deewana (1962), Anpadh, Bombay Ka Chor (1962). Critics believe her career best performance was in Bahurani (1963), Gumrah, Gehra Daag, Apne Huye Paraye and Jahan Ara. Apart from pairing with Pradeep Kumar, her pairing opposite Raaj Kumar, Rajendra Kumar, Biswajit and Manoj Kumar in woman-oriented films were appreciated by audiences, with her work opposite Biswajit being the most popular. With Raaj Kumar, she gave box office hits like Phool Bane Angaare, Maryada and Karmayogi and opposite Manoj Kumar, gave commercial successes like Hariyali Aur Rasta, Apne Huye Paraye and Himalaya Ki God Mein. The hits with Rajendra Kumar were Devar Bhabhi, Dhool Ka Phool, Patang, Geet and Lalkar. With Biswajit her popular movies include Aasra, Night in London, Do Kaliyaan, Tamanna, Nai Roshni and critically acclaimed films Pyar Ka Sapna, Paisa Ya Pyaar, Jaal and Phir Kab Milogi. She did 10 films with Biswajit. In 2007, they won the Star Screen Lifetime Achievement Award, calling them on stage together giving due respect to their popularity as a pair who have tasted box office success. The most remarkable feature of career of Mala Sinha was that most of her 1960s and 1970s hits were fueled by her own star power as much as the heroes and most of the times her role was more powerful than the hero. Though she was pitted opposite her seniors like Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Kishore Kumar, Pradeep Kumar and when she acted opposite the emerging stars from late 1950s like Shammi Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar and Raaj Kumar, she made sure her role was as good as theirs. The characters she played stood out and gave her recognition for her performances. Sinha did not mind working with newcomers as long as her role was worth it. She worked with many newcomers of her era including Manoj Kumar, Dharmendra, Rajesh Khanna, Sunil Dutt, Sanjay Khan, Jeetendra and Amitabh Bachchan. In most of her films from the 1960s, she got the first billing in the credits, even before the heroes, with exceptions being those with Guru Dutt, Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Pradeep Kumar and Kishore Kumar.Her career's biggest blockbuster was Maryada released in 1971. In 1966, Sinha went to Nepal to act in a Nepali film called Maitighar when the Nepali film industry was still in its infancy. This was the only Nepali film she did in her career. The hero was an estate owner called Chidambar Prasad Lohani. Soon after, Mala Sinha married C. P. Lohani with the blessings of her parents. From the beginning theirs was a long-distance marriage with Lohani based in Kathmandu to look after his business and Sinha living in Bombay with their daughter Pratibha. She continued acting after her marriage. She has been a heroine in many Bengali films. In Bengali films she has acted with Uttam Kumar and Kishore Kumar. Her last Bengali work as a female lead was Kabita (1977) which featured Ranjit Mullick and Kamal Hassan; it was a super-hit at the box office. She is noted for her strong women-oriented, glamorous roles fueled by her equal star power on par with the heroes in films like Dhool Ka Phool, Suhag Sindoor,Anpadh, Phir Subah Hogi, Hariyali Aur Rasta, Bahurani, Aasra, Do Kaliyaan, Gumrah, Aankhen, Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi, Himalaya Ki God Mein, Do Kaliyaan, Holi Aayi Re, Nai Roshni, Mere Huzoor, Kangan, Archana, Maryada amongst others. Of her rich and varied repertoire, she mentions she is rather partial to Jahan Ara (1964), a historical movie that Meena Kumari passed on to her: \"Meenaji turned down the role saying that she would not look the part whereas I would. Given my ignorance of Urdu, I was rather sceptical but Meenaji was convinced that I could do justice to the role. Playing Mumtaz Mahal's eldest daughter entailed gruelling Urdu classes and learning royal tehzeeb. It was hot on the grand sets erected at Ranjit Studio and the film had Madan Mohan's haunting music. It was a film replete with lyrical moments.\" From 1974, she cut down on her assignments as the lead actresses. She accepted strong character roles in films like 36 Ghante (1974), Zindagi (1976), Karmayogi (1978), Be-Reham (1980), Harjaee (1981), Yeh Rishta Na Tootay, Babu (film) and Khel, which were popular. In the early '90s Madhuri Dixit was promoted as the new Mala Sinha in magazines. But, after 1994, she completely withdrew from industry and has given very few public appearances. In Dhool Ka Phool and B.R. Chopra's Gumrah, she played the first unwed mother and adulterous wife respectively in Hindi cinema. As she grew older, she gracefully moved on to doing character roles that befitted her age. She was last seen in Zid (1994). Though Mala evinced as much interest in her daughter Pratibha's career as her father did in her career, she was unable to achieve the same success for her daughter. Mala Sinha was born to Madhesi ethnic Nepali parents after they immigrated to West Bengal, India from Madhesh plains of Nepal. Sinha married a Pahari ethnic Nepali actor Chidambar Prasad Lohani of Nepal in 1968. The couple met when they worked together in the Nepali film Maitighar (1966). Lohani had an estate agency business. After her marriage, she used to come and stay in Mumbai to shoot films while her husband stayed in Nepal running his business. She has one daughter from the marriage: Pratibha Sinha, who is a former Bollywood actress. From the late 1990s, the couple and their daughter have been residing in a bungalow in Bandra, Mumbai."

        "artist_name": "Mandakini_(actress)", 
        "biography": " Mandakini (born 30 July 1963, as Yasmeen Joseph) is a former Bollywood actress. She is best remembered for her role in the 1985 movie Ram Teri Ganga Maili.   Mandakini was born in an Anglo Indian family in Meerut. Her father, Joseph is British and her mother is Muslim. Starting off as an unknown girl from Meerut, Yasmin was rejected by atleast three film makers before Ranjit Virk changed her name to Madhuri and signed her up for \"Mazloom\". Before the film could take off, Raj Kapoor discovered her at age of 22 and cast her in a lead role in 1985 movie, Ram Teri Ganga Maili with the screen name \"Mandakini\" opposite his youngest son, Rajiv Kapoor. The movie was a blockbuster, and it earned Mandakini a Filmfare nomination as Best Actress. Her physical assets were exploited to the full in the film which had caused quite a stir, especially because of two scenes in it: one in which Mandakini was shown bathing under a waterfall wearing only a flimsy white saree through which her breasts and nipples were clearly visible  and another in which she was shown breast-feeding a child. This movie made her the ultimate sex-symbol of Hindi screen then. Since then she was offered dare-all bare-all lead roles. Mandakini acted in a few more successful films, such as Dance Dance with Mithun Chakraborty, Kahan Hai Kanoon with Aditya Pancholi and Pyaar Karke Dekho with Govinda, but never managed to recreate the success of her first movie. In 1994, photographs began circulating of Mandakini in the presence of dreaded gangster Dawood Ibrahim. Rumours had already been doing the rounds that the two were having an affair, and the photos only served to fuel them. One of the theories put forward was that Ibrahim, who was known to have a keen interest in Bollywood and had financed movies, had pressured Rishi Kapoor into casting Mandakini, and she was his mistress. Later, it was alleged that she had moved to Dubai to be with him. Mandakini vehemently denied all rumours linking her to Dawood. She was extremely famous. While she admitted to knowing and being on friendly terms with him, she claimed that they did not know each other personally, let alone be a couple. Mandakini's career suffered a serious setback. She quit movies after Zordaar in 1996 and has lived in Mumbai with her husband and children. Since then, she has made attempts to reinvent herself. She released two pop music albums \u2013 No Vacancy and Shambala \u2013 neither of which was a success. Currently, she runs classes in Tibetan yoga and is a follower of the Dalai Lama. With her husband, she runs a centre for Tibetan medicine, which is commonly known as the Tibetan Herbal Centre in the area. In 1990, Mandakini married a former Buddhist monk, Dr. Kagyur T. Rinpoche Thakur. Thakur gained fame in childhood as the baby featured in Murphy Radio advertisements in the 1970s and 1980s. They have a son named Rabbil and a daughter Rabze Innaya Thakur."

        "biography": " Manisha Koirala (born 16 August 1970) is a Nepali actress known for her work in Indian cinema, as well as a UNFPA Goodwill Ambassador and social activist. Koirala has established herself in bollywood and worked in Hindi cinema, though she has appeared in several Nepali, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam films as well. Born to politician Prakash Koirala and Sushma Koirala in the politically prominent Koirala family of Nepal, she was trained in Bharatnatyam and Manipuri dance. She made her acting debut in the Nepali film Pheri Bhetaula (1989)\u2013A year later, Koirala made her Bollywood debut with the top-grossing drama Saudagar (1991). She went on to establish herself as one of the leading actresses in the 1990s with such mainstream films as 1942: A Love Story (1994), Agni Sakshi (1996), Gupt (1997) and Mann (1999), she was also voted the most beautiful actress in 1990s and leading actress of Indian cinema of a decade . Recognised for her acting prowess, Koirala was noted for her performances in films such as Bombay, Akele Hum Akele Tum (both 1995), Khamoshi: The Musical (1996), Dil Se.. (1998), Lajja (2001) and Company (2002). She has won the Filmfare Critics' Award thrice and has received nine nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress so far. Although box-office collections of her films have varied considerably, critics have noted that her niche as an actor remains unharmed irrespective of her commercial potent. Off-screen she is frequented in the media as a \"controversy's child\" with her bohemian stance and candid comments often described as \"outspoken\" and \"bold\". She was awarded \"Nepal's Humanitarian Ambassador\" at the We Care for Humanity's 3rd Global Officials of Dignity Awards which was held at UN Millennium Hotel in August, 2015.   Manisha Koirala was born in Kathmandu to Prakash and Sushma Koirala. Her grandfather, Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala, was Prime Minister of Nepal during the late 1950s-early 1960s, as were two of her great-uncles, Girija Prasad Koirala and Matrika Prasad Koirala. She studied at VKM, Varanasi until Class X. She stayed with her grandmother in Varanasi during her studies. After passing tenth standard she shifted to the Army Public School, Dhaula Kuan, New Delhi (APS). Her ambition was to be a doctor, but a modelling stint opened a career path into Bollywood. Her brother Siddharth Koirala is also an actor of Hindi cinema and had collaborated with her once in the film Anwar. In 2004, she returned from New York after receiving a diploma in film making. She became a member of an independent documentary filmmaker's society. She had studied at New York University. Her first film was Pheri Bhetaula (We Shall Meet Again), a Nepali movie released in early 1989. Her first Hindi movie was Subhash Ghai's Saudagar in 1991. She starred in a number of films during 1992\u20131993 before Vidhu Vinod Chopra's love saga 1942: A Love Story (1994) and Mani Ratnam's Tamil drama Bombay (1995) came out. Her performance in the film Bombay was a milestone in her career which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actress and Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance. She was seriously noticed by Bollywood after the release of 1942: A Love Story which was a year earlier than the release of Bombay. She also starred in Mansoor Khan's romantic musical Akele Hum Akele Tum (1995) as the ignored wife who leaves her husband and child to fulfill her singing talent and subsequently becomes a popular star. In 1996 she received positive reviews for her performance in the drama Agni Sakshi, as a battered wife on the run from her mentally ill husband. The film became one of the biggest hits of that year at the Indian box office. Later that year, she acted in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's directorial debut, Khamoshi: The Musical where she played the role of Annie, a caring daughter to deaf and mute parents. A critic from Channel 4 wrote, \"Koirala... demonstrates the full range of her acting ability, rather than playing against it as she has had to do in more traditional films. The scene where she shouts at her father through the door, screaming and using sign language even though she knows he can neither see nor hear her, is extremely powerful.\" Filmfare magazine later included her performance in the film on its \"80 Iconic Performances\" list. In 1997, she played the leading role alongside Kajol and Bobby Deol in the thriller Gupt: The Hidden Truth, which was one of the biggest hits that year. She went on to collaborate once again with acclaimed director Mani Ratnam, and starred in his film Dil Se..(1998) opposite Shah Rukh Khan. Her role received similarly good reviews, and earned her several award nominations including the Filmfare Best Actress Award nomination. Despite performing poorly at the box office in India, the film proved to be a hit overseas. So if one has to name her most notable films of the 1990s then it would definitely be these four films: 1942: A Love Story, Bombay, Khamoshi: The Musical and Dil Se, through which she kissed success in Bollywood on the basis of her talent. With no god father in Bollywood and being a Non-Indian, she reached the peak of her career during the 1990s and mostly seen as a beautiful and talented actress. In 1999, she starred in the successful Kachche Dhaage , which was followed by six more releases, the most notable of them being Indra Kumar's drama Mann. She played the role of a traffic accident victim in the film, which entered into the top five highest-grossing films of the year. Her performance in the film won her favourable reviews. Film critic M. Ali Ikram wrote about her performance, \"If there is respite for Manisha's innumerable fans of late, this flick is it. We may not care about hits and flops, but it is painful to watch this acting virtuoso in the innumerable side roles she has been seen in of late. Indra Kumar's decision to cast Manisha here, is a case of perfect casting, and she never lets him or the audience down. This lady is truly the Meena Kumari of her generation. It is great fun watching Manisha and Aamir Khan's perfect chemistry opposite one another. The film's climax has both stars permanently molding a spot for themselves in Bollywood history, and it will have you shedding tears by the bucketful.\" In 2000 she hosted the TV show Sawaal Dus Crore Ka on Zee TV alongside Anupam Kher. In 2001, she starred in the drama Grahan opposite Jackie Shroff. Her portrayal of a rape victim in the film who quests for justice was appreciated, but the film, which was a much-delayed project, was a major commercial failure. She next played the protagonist in Rajkumar Santoshi's drama Lajja along with an ensemble cast that included Rekha, Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit. The film received a positive reception from critics, and so did Koirala's performance. Her last release of the year was Moksha opposite Arjun Rampal, which was a failure at the box office.[citation needed] In 2002, she starred opposite Ajay Devgan in Ram Gopal Verma's Company.

Taran Adarsh from indiaFM wrote, \"Manisha Koirala sinks her teeth in this role and delivers a fine performance.\" She next starred in Sirf (2008). The film was released without any notice or publicity and was a critical and box office failure. Her first Bengali film Khela directed by Rituparno Ghosh released the same year, along with the long delayed Hindi film Mehbooba, both films released on the same day.

A remake of the 1989 film of the same name, the film saw her reprising the role originally played by Srividya, her performance earned her a nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Tamil. She was next seen in director Onir's critically acclaimed anthology film I Am, sharing the screen with Juhi Chawla; noted film critic Taran Adarsh commented, \"It's a delight to watch Juhi and Manisha, after a hiatus. Both deliver striking performances \u2013 even getting the language right.\" Her next film was Deepti Naval's directorial debut Do Paise Ki Dhoop, Char Aane Ki Barish which premiered at the market section of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival to a positive response. In 2012, she was re-teamed with director Ram Gopal Verma for his 3D horror film Bhoot Returns which is a sequel to 2003 hit Bhoot.

Bajpayee is often regarded as a method actor and a director's actor, and is known for his unconventional roles in films. Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui has cited Bajpayee's performance in Aks as the inspiration for his role as the antagonist in Kick (2014). Bajpayee has also been vocal about the disparity in the pay he commands, in comparison to the top actors in the film industry. He has cited Amitabh Bachchan, Naseeruddin Shah and Raghubir Yadav as his inspirations. Director Ram Gopal Varma considers him to be \"an education for me\" and \"simply the best actor I've ever worked with.\" Shekhar Kapur, who directed him in Bandit Queen, recalls: \"Manoj had the ability to portray a lot just by doing little. He never tried to overplay a scene and seemed totally comfortable with a minimalist statement.\" According to director Hansal Mehta, Manoj \"has the ability to transform himself like few others.\" Bajpayee's performance as Bhiku Mhatre in Satya is considered to be one of the most memorable characters of Hindi cinema, along with his dialogue in it: \"Mumbai ka king kaun? Bhiku Mhatre\" (Who is the king of Mumbai? Bhiku Mhatre). Kay Kay Menon credits this character as a turning point for other method actors: \"If it were not for Manoj\u2019s brilliant performance in Satya, actors like Irrfan and me might still be waiting to be accepted. Manoj opened the doors for us.\" Writing about the character in his book Popcorn Essayists, journalist-writer Jai Arjun Singh wrote that the \"earthiness\" and the \"authenticity\" [of the character], was the subtle result of a persistence in Bajpai's performance.\""

        "biography": " Meena Kumari (1 August 1933 \u2013 31 March 1972), born Mahjabeen Bano, was an Indian film actress, singer and poet under the pseudonym \"Naaz\", also known as The Tragedy Queen. Indian film critics regarded Meena Kumari as 'historically incomparable' actress of Hindi cinema. Meena Kumari made waves as an actor beyond compare in the 60s, Kumari got the author-backed roles and her male co-stars were said to be wary of starring opposite her. During a career spanning 30 years from her childhood to her death, she starred in more than 90 films of variety of genres, many of which have achieved classic and cult status today such as Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam, Pakeezah, Mere Apne, Aarti, Baiju Bawra, Parineeta, Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai, Foot Path, Char Dil Char Rahen, Daera, Azaad, Miss Mary, Sharada, Dil Ek Mandir, Kaajal, Chirag Kahan Roshni Kahan, Majhli Didi, Phool Aur Patthar, Bhabhi Ki Chudiyan, Yahudi, Halaku, Baadbaan and Kohinoor. Kumari was also a playback singer, as a child artist till 1945, later as an actress and as a heroine in Duniya Ek Sarai , Piya Ghar Aaja and Bichchade Balam. Vinod Mehta (writer of Meena Kumari - The Classic Biography) was told by a director, \"Even Dilip Kumar (the tragedy king) found it difficult to keep his calm in front of her.\" Raaj Kumar would often forget his dialogues while working with Meena Kumari on set. Madhubala was also a fan of Meena Kumari and said, \u2018She has the most unique voice. No other heroine has it.\u2019 Satyajit Ray described Kumari as \"undoubtedly an actress of the highest calibre\". Meena Kumari empathized greatly with Marilyn Monroe the fact that Marilyn's husband, Arthur Miller, had some passing similarities to Meena's husband Kamal Amrohi, made the identification closer.It is said throughout her life, Meena Kumari had a love\u2013hate relationship with movies. Meena Kumari won four Filmfare awards in the Best Actress category and was the first recipient of the inaugural 1st Filmfare 1954 best actress award for Baiju Bawra with a consecutive win in 2nd Filmfare 1955 for Parineeta. Kumari made history at the 10th Filmfare 1963 by receiving all of the nominations for Best Actress and won for her performance in Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam. On 13th Filmfare 1966 Kumari won her last best actress Filmfare award for Kaajal. The greatest hallmark of Meena Kumari lied in her ability to depict the struggle of Indian women existing specially in the 50s and 60s, Kumari Onscreen Persona is described as a perfect example of real traditional Bharatiya Nari by the Indian film fraternity like Mohammed Zahur Khayyam and Javed Akhtar. Kumari gained a reputation for playing grief-stricken and tragic roles, and her performances have been praised and reminisced throughout the years. Like Kumari portrayed of Pakeezah under Kamal Amrohi's direction became historical piece of document. In her performances, beauty, aristrocracy, tragedy, personality all blended into one. Her role as Chhoti Bahu, in Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam is considered one of the best performances in Indian Cinema. Chhoti Bahu a role dangerously close to Kumari's own tragic life, like the character of Chhoti Bahu, in real life Meena Kumari also became addicted to alcohol. Kumari life and prosperous career were marred by heavy drinking, troubled relationships, an ensuing deteriorating health, and her death from liver cirrhosis in 1972.   Meena Kumari's father was a Sunni Muslim named Master Ali Bux who had migrated from Bhera, Punjab. He was a veteran of Parsi theater, played harmonium, taught music, and wrote Urdu poetry and played small roles in films like \"Idd Ka Chand\" and composed music for films like \"Shahi Lutere\". Meena Kumari's mother Iqbal Beghum original name was Prabhawati, she was a Bengali Christian converted to Islam. Iqbal Beghum was the second wife of Ali Bux. Before meeting and then marrying Ali Bux, she was a stage actress and dancer, under the stage name, Kamini and earlier in her life related to the well known Tagore family of Bengal. Meena Kumari's grandmother, Hem Sundari Thakur (Tagore), was the daughter of the Rabindranath Tagore's younger brother. She was married into the Tagore family, but she became a widow at an early age, after she lost her husband, Rev Bill, she was compelled to give up all her rights to the family name or property by her in-laws. She embraced Christianity left for Meerut, became a nurse, and married a Christian, an Urdu journalist named Pyare Lal Shankar Meeruti. Hem Sundari has two daughters; one of these was Prabhawati(Iqbal Beghum), Meena Kumari's mother. Meena Kumari was born with the birth name Mahjabeen into the family of poor theatre artistes Ali Bux and Iqbal Begum on 1 August 1933, this was a great disappointment to Ali Bux because he desperately wanted a son. The Bux family lived next to Rooptara studios in Dadar, Bombay, and Ali Bux was forever hopeful of getting a major break in the film industry. But that never happened. Meena Kumari was the second daughter of Ali Bux and Iqbal Begum. Khursheed was her elder sister and Mahliqa(also known as madhu first married to actor Mehmood Ali) was her younger sister. At home, Mahjabeen's family fondly called her by the name \"Munna\". At the time of her birth, her parents were unable to pay the fees of the Dr Gadre who had delivered her, so her father left her at a Muslim orphanage however, he picked her up after a few hours. I never had a collection of bright colored marbles like other children. -Meena Kumari Little Mahjabeen is said to have said, \"I do not want to work in movies, I want to go to school, and learn like other children. But despite her protestations of wanting to go to school, her parents started peddling four year Mahjabeen to film studios for work apportunities and director Vijay Bhatt offered little Mahjabeen a child's role in his production, Leatherface, that released in 1939. It made me behave queerly as i now realize. I remember once i was \"shot\" on the sets and asked to drop down dead. I refused to fall and they had to use force to make me obey. I often played \"back\" for other children but refused to sing myself. My one interest was to read and when other children in the studio went out to play in the compound, I moved into a corner and lost myself in the world of children's book. -Meena Kumari  Mahjabeen's looks and talent brought more opportunities, ever since that ugly beginning against her wishes, at the age of four she became the bread earner in the Bux family. In an interview in 1962 Meena Kumari explained that the fact she had been supporting her parents from the age of four gave her immense satisfaction. Kumari further said \"The first day troted along to work i little imagined that i was saying goodbye to the normal pleasantries of childhood. I thought i would go to the studio for a few days and then go to the school, learn a few things and play and make merry like other children but that was not to be.\" Mahjabeen was admitted into a regular school but that was not for long because the demands of work frequently interrupted her curriculum, she never went to school in any meaningful sense and her education was the result of private tuition and more significantly the result of individual interest, in every sense she was self-educated. Kumari concentrated most on Urdu although she could get by in English and Hindhi. Little Mahjabeen used to carry her children's books onto the sets and even while travelling with her parents on outstation shoots. On the sets little Mahjabeen was nicknamed \"Reading Mahjabeen\". Little Mahjabeen embarked on her acting career at the age of four. She was immersed in work over next four years as a child artist, mostly in Vijay Bhatt productions Leatherface (1939), Adhuri Kahani (1939), Pooja (1940), Ek Hi Bhool (1940) Vijay Bhatt became her mentor and, on the sets of Ek Hi Bhool (1940), rechristened Mahjabeen as Baby Meena. More films followed for baby Meena Nai Roshni (1941), Bahen (1941), Kasauti (1941), Vijay/Vijaya (1942), Garib (1942), Pratiggya (1943) and Lal Haveli (1944). At the young age of 14 baby Meena became the heroine Meena Kumari in Ramnik Production's Bachchon Ka Khel (1946) more films followed Duniya Ek Sarai (1946), Piya Ghar Aaja (1947) and Bichchade Balam (1948) performing with credit and winning recognition from all in the industry. The phase continued with several hits on the box office, including some mythologicals and fantasies Veer Ghatotkach, (1949) Shri Ganesh Mahima (1950), Magroor, (1950) Hamara Ghar, (1950) Anmol Ratan, (1950) Sanam, (1951) Madhosh, (1951) Lakshmi Narayan,(1951) Hanuman Patal Vijay, (1951) Aladdin Aur Jadui Chirag (1952) and Tamasha (1952). On the sets of Tamasha, Ashok Kumar introduced filmmaker Kamal Amrohi to Meena Kumari. Later Kamal Amrohi offered Meena Kumari a lead role in his upcoming film \"Anarkali\" and the contract was signed on 13 March 1951. On 21 May 1951 Meena Kumari was involved in a serious motor car accident while returning from Mahabaleshwar to Bombay. She was admitted to Sasoon hospital Poona, was severely damaged around the left hand and there was some doubt whether she would be able to use it again. Kumari went through terrible bouts of depression, Kamal Amrohi religiously visited her during her days in hospital. When they were not scheduled to meet both Kumari and Amrohi would write letters to each other. \"A year has passed since then, and I am still the happiest person in the world because the man I have married is still the ideal man I loved before I had ever met him. We understand each other completely. Kamal has lived up to my every thought of him. I have found him exactly as I had dreamed of him - I hope, indeed I know, he will say the same of me. Something of this deep understanding and kinship of soul which lies between us may perhaps be seen in the picture we have just made together, \"Daaera.\" For four months this hospital affair continued and love blossomed. This accident left Meena Kumari with a banded left pinky which remained banded through out her life and Kumari used to cover her left hand with dupatta or saree during shoots. After Kumari discharged from hospital the famous telephoning marathon began between Kumari and Amrohi during nights. Soon shooting of the film Anarkali was begun but the producer Makhanlal suffered a crippling financial disaster so the film Anarkali was abandoned. On 14 February 1952 Meena Kumari age 19 and Kamal Amrohi age 34 secretly married in a simple 'Nikah' ceremony in the presence of a Qadi and Kumari's younger sister Mahliqa (madhu). The nikah paper was witnessed by Baqar Ali (Kamal Amrohi, friend and assistant) and Qadi's two sons, and signed in the name of Mahjabeen Bano (Meena Kumari's real name) and Syeed Ameen Haider (Kamal Amrohi's real name). After the ceremony Amrohi planted a kiss on Kumari's forehead and the newlyweds parted, Amrohi left for Sion, Meena and Madhu returned home.The marriage was kept secret from family and media, although Kamal Amrohi had been married and had three children. After some months the matrimony news leaked to father Ali Bux by a servant who overheard their midnight phone conversation , angry father regularly hurled accusations, and recommended a divorce. Meena Kumari remained adamant on her marriage decision but stayed in her father's house. Kamal Amrohi planned a film called Daera in 1953. Kumari asked her father's permission that her husband need her for the film Daera but Ali Bux refused that the dates were given to Mehboob Khan for film Amar. Reluctantly, Meena Kumari agreed but after five days shooting Meena Kumari instigated a disagreement with Mehboob Khan and left the studios. The following day Meena Kumari disclosed to her father that she was off to Bombay Talkies to work for her husband Kamal Amrohi's Film Daera. Ali Bux warned his daughter that if she went in that direction the doors of his house would be permanently shut to her. On 14 August 1953 Meena Kumari drove to Bombay Talkies and worked in front of her husband's camera and at night, when Meena Kumari came back from the Film Daera shooting, her father refused to open the door. Meena Kumari turned her car and left for her husband's residence at Sion. When the news of the marriage became public, Indian press commented \"Meena Kumari's reputation as the quiet and silent girl of the Indian cinema was aided considerably by her announcement of her marriage which had been kept secret over a year.\" In a sponsored program broadcast over Radio Ceylon in 1958, Meena Kumari gushed enthusiastically about her first ever visit to her husband's home town, Amroha, in the north-west region of Uttar Pradesh. She and Kamal had been there in 1956, four years after they were married. The area is rich in culture, architecture, mangoes, sugarcane and fresh water fish. Meena Kumari exulted with joy and gratitude, and referred to her husband with high regard, love and extreme respect. A friend actress Nadira said in an interview \"Meena is wildly in love with her husband whom she admires, respects and fears. What is more, she is terribly possessive of him! Kumari always addressed Amrohi as \"Chandan\" or \"Kamal Sahab\", and Amrohi called Meena Kumari \"Manju\". In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Meena Kumari essayed roles in films that mirrored her own unhappy life, after separation (never a formal divorce) from husband Kamal Amrohi. The intensity and power in those celluloid tragedies were derived from her own personal situation and emotional make up in those years. The conviction and strength of those characters she portrayed, in a series of films, earned her a repute as The Great Tragedienne and the endearing crown of The Tragedy Queen of Indian Cinema popularly bestowed on Meena Kumari. The year 1962 proved to be a watershed. Meena Kumari created history in Filmfare, and remains unique to this day, by being the sole leading lady to have been nominated at all slots for the 10th Filmfare Best Actress award in 1963. The nominations were for her roles in Sahib Biwi Aur Ghulam, Aarti and Main Chup Rahungi. Kumari won her third best actress Filmfare for Sahib Biwi Aur Ghulam. The Bengal Film Journalists' Association conferred the Best Actress Award on Meena Kumari for Aarti. A film produced by Guru Dutt and directed by Abrar Alvi. It is based on a Bengali novel, \"Shaheb Bibi Golam\" by Bimal Mitra. The film stars Meena Kumari, Guru Dutt, Rehman, Waheeda Rehman and Nazir Hussain. The film's music is by Hemant Kumar and lyrics were by Shakeel Badayuni. The film is also noted for its brilliant cinematography by V. K. Murthy and famous Songs \"Na Jao Saiyan Churda Ke Baiyan\" and \"Piya Aiso Jiya Mein\" sung by Geeta Dutt. Sahib Biwi Aur Ghulam was perhaps the most perilous mix of the reel and real. Meena Kumari Played the character of Chotti Bahu which was dangerously close to her own tragic life. Meena Kumari wrote in her private diary \"The women is troubling me a great deal. All day long and a good part of my night it is nothing else but Chhoti Bahu's helplessness, Chhoti Bahu's sorrow, Chhoti Bahu's smiles, Chotti Bahu's hopes, Chotti Bahu's tribulations, Chotti Bahu's endurance, Chotti Bahu's ... Chotti Bahu's ... Chotti Bahu ... Oh\u00a0! i am sick of it.\" By Shoma Chatterji The film was a major critical and commercial success, with critics attributing it to Meena Kumari's performance as Chotti Bahu, which is regarded as one of the best performances of Hindi cinema.To quote the review featured in Upperstall \"While each of the performances are spot on, if there is one person who is the heart and soul of the film, it is Meena Kumari. Her portrayal of Chhoti Bahu is perhaps the greatest performance ever seen by an actress on the Indian Screen.\" The film won four Filmfare Awards, including Best Actress award.Same year Meena Kumari made a history in Filmfare by getting all the nominations in best actress category and won Filmfare best actress award for Sahib Biwi Aur Ghulam.This movie is also nominated for the Golden Bear at the 13th Berlin International Film Festival, and Meena Kumari was selected as a delegate. Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam was also chosen as India's official entry to the Oscars. To quote the review featured in The Times of India dated 24 June 1962: The well-knit screenplay, achieving an effective balance between the various characters and emotional phases, provides a neat dramatic pattern. It appears to be a specially successful job considering the verbosity and digressiveness of the novel of Mr. Bimal Mitra who, though often brilliant, writes in a highly disorderly way. After their marriage, Kamal Amrohi allowed Meena Kumari to continue her acting career, but on three conditions. 1. You will return home by 6:30 every evening. 2. You will allow no one in the makeup room except your makeup man. 3. You will sit in your own car which will take you to work and fetch you back. Meena Kumari agreed to all terms but with passing time she kept breaking them. It is said Kumari felt oppressed by the feudal attitude and high handed behaviour that Kamal Amrohi brought to their relationship. Kamal Amrohi's lavish productions, Daera and Pakeezah, and his Kamalistan studios (1958), were mostly financed by Kumari earnings. Meena Kumari was watched over. Kamal Amrohi had issued strict instructions, and had people deployed assistant Baqar Ali, to prevent any other man from meeting Meena Kumari on the sets. In 1972 Kamal Amrohi told Vinod Mehta(writer of Meena Kumari - The Classic Biography) \"I did'nt mean it like that. These were just ground rules. I mean if she returned home at 7 instead of 6:30 it was acceptable for me. I just wanted her to appriciate that besides having resposibilities to her career she had resposibilities to her home and husband\". Amrohi further said that he was prepared to overlook Meena bending his conditions but he would have loved if she herself confessed when such bendings took place. 'It really pained me to learn of these incidents from outside sources '. Kamal Amrohi said in an interview with Filmfare Magazine, that he used to advise Meena against accepting assignments which would harm her reputation. He used to be a little harsh sometimes, he admitted, but it was all in her interest. \" In that 10 x 12 poster of concentrated womanhood called Meena Kumari, is hidden: an extremist, a thinker, a writer of unlimited imagination, an orthodox idealist, a very determined and self-respecting woman, a God and husband-respecting lady, and a comedian too. Khursheed explained clearly 'she loved children. Kamal Sahab never wanted a child from Meena' Kamal denied 'It was Manju who never wanted a baby because she felt it will harm her screen image'. Nargis Dutt relates how she once questioned Meena. Haven't you ever wanted to become a mother? \" Is there any woman who does not want to become a mother\" Meena replied with tears in her eyes. Kumari raised Kamal Amrohi's son, Tajdaar, who was greatly attached to his Chhoti Ammi (younger mother). Abrar Alvi director of Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam recounts how Kamal Amrohi would have his spy and right-hand man Baqar Ali present even in the makeup room while Meena's makeup was being done and one awful evening when, working beyond schedule to complete a shot, he had to face his heroine dissolving in tears. In 1963, Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam was selected as the Indian entry to the Berlin Film Festival and Meena Kumari was selected as a delegate. The then Minister of information arranged for two tickets, one of Meena Kumari and one for her husband but Kamal Amrohi refused to accompany her wife and said \" I do not want to tag along merely as Meena Kumari's husband.\" The Berlin trip never materialized. \" When her star start rising his went down.I asked Kamal Amrohi if indeed he had hit her as per many rumors. He completely denied it, saying that such a thing was totally against his unbringing. But six different people told me that there was physical violence in their relationship. Those were the days when Meena Kumari would not come back to Rembrandt till late at night. During a premiere at Eros cinema Sohrab Modi introduced Meena Kumari and Kamal Amrohi to the governor of Maharashtra. Sohrab Modi said' This is the reowned actress Meena Kumari and this is her husband Kamal Amrohi'. Whereupon before greetings exchanged, Kamal Amrohi interjected, 'No, i am Kamal Amrohi and this is my wife, the reowned actress Meena Kumari'. Saying this Kamal Amrohi left the auditorium. Meena Kumari saw the premiere alone. On 5 March 1964, on the mahurat of the film Pinjre ke Panchi, Kamal Amrohi's assistant, Baqar Ali slapped Meena Kumari once when Kumari insisted on letting the budding poet lyricist Gulzar, into her make up room. Meena Kumari never returned home and never stepped in their Pali Naka home thereafter. Kumari stayed in actor Mehmood's house for a while, who was married to her sister, Mahliqa (Madhu), before moving to one in Janaki Kutir, Juhu. Kamal Amrohi rushed to Mehmood's house to reconcile their differences and escort her back. But Kumari refused. Meena Kumari wrote in her poetry about Amrohi: \u062f\u0644 \u0633\u0627 \u0633\u0627\u062a\u06be\u06cc \u062c\u0628 \u067e\u0627\u064a\u0627 \u0628\u06d2 \u0686\u064a\u0646\u06cc \u0628\u06be\u06cc \u0633\u0627\u062a\u06be \u0645\u0644\u06cc\n \u0926\u093f\u0932\u0938\u093e \u0938\u093e\u0925\u0940 \u091c\u092c \u092a\u093e\u092f\u093e\n\u092c\u0947\u091a\u0948\u0928\u0940 \u092d\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u092e\u093f\u0932\u0940\n\"Dil saa saathi jab paya\nBechaini bhi saath mili\"\n\n(When I found a partner like my heart Restlessness also found with him) Meena Kumari was a patient of chronic insomnia and was on sleeping pills for a long time, during 1963 Dr Saeed Timurza, her physician, then prescribed a small peg of brandy as a sleeping pill alternative and this was officially how she came into contact with the habit that was to kill her. Somehow this prescribed peg of brandy turned into heavy drinking after Kumari separation from her husband. Meena Kumari and Kamal Amrohi never formally divorced but separated in 1964. During those years of separation from her husband, Kumari name was associated with Rahul, Gulzar, Dharmendra and Sawan Kumar Tak. Heavy drinking had badly damaged Meena Kumari's liver. In 1968, she fell seriously ill. Medical advice was that Kumari needed more advanced and permanent cure. Dr Sherlock warned Meena Kumari before she left the infirmary, \"The day you want to die have a drink.\" Kumari was taken to London and Switzerland in June 1968 for treatment. From the months of June to August Meena Kumari was in the safe hands of Dr Sheila Sherlock. Upon recovery, Kumari returned to India in September 1968. Director Sawan Kumar Tak said \"Not only did she not drink, she would not let me drink either. she did not touch a drop after London\". \"Shah Jahan made Taj Mahal for his wife, Kamal Sahab wanted to do the same with Pakeezah.\" In 1955 Meena Kumari and Kamal Amrohi were in South India and here Kamal Amrohi began outlining the plot of his next film with his wife Meena Kumari and decided that he would call it Pakeezah, the name has a fascinating history too. It was changed many times due to superstitious reasons, but finally the original stayed. After the failure of Daera in 1953, Pakeezah as an idea was roaming Amrohi's mind. A concept, he say was irretrievably fixed with his love for his wife. He hopes to create a film which would be worthy of her as an actress, and worthy of the love he felt for her as a women. Kamal declares that every line he wrote he had Meena in mind. He wished to present her on the screen as no one had before: beautiful, sad, sanguine, dejected, calculating, sexy he ambitioned to capture as many dimensions of her as he knew of. Pakeezah took 16 years to reach the silver screen. First planned by Amrohi in 1956, the film went on the studio floors in 1964, but the shooting came to a standstill after their separation(never formally divorced ) in March 1964, when it was more than halfway complete. Mr Amrohi wrote a letter to his estranged wife on 24 August 1968. \"Only Pakeezah completion remain unsettled.You have made a condition that unless i give you a divorce you will not complete Pakeezah. Even this knot can be untied ... I will free you from your marital ties. After this if you wish to complete your Pakeezah. I would be the most happy to do so. This is my request, that Pakeezah on which the fortune of many people depends, and which had the good wishes of so many people should not be left uncompleted if possible. You have better means. You have box-office appeal, and most of all Pakeezah needs you personally ... Pakeezah that is like a sinking ship will reach a shore under your care.\" Meena Kumari wrote to her husband Kamal Amrohi in the early 1969 \"In regard to my working in Pakeezah, I have always been willing and clamouring to work. Pakeezah is my life dream and it will be my greatest pleasure to see it completed. As for my remuneration, I am glad you have given me an opportunity to prove my regards and respect for you. I shall accept only ONE GUINEA as a token of goodwill for my entire work in Pakeezah.\" on 16 March 1969, five years and twelve days after Kumari left her husband, Gravelly ill, Meena Kumari reported for work again on Pakeezah. Kamal Amrohi organized a great reception. He gave his wife a peda(sweet) as a peace offering, and made a documentary film on her arrival at the studio. Meena Kumari was determined to complete the film and, was well aware of the limited time left for her to live, went out of her way to complete it at the earliest. Despite her rapidly deteriorating health, she gave the finishing touches to her performance. Vinod Mehta (writer of Meena Kumari - The Classic Biography) shared an incident which occurred during the last days of Pakeezah shooting \"On outdoor shooting Kamal Amrohi's unit travelled in two cars near a place called Shivpuri in Madhya Pradesh, the cars all but ran out of patrol , and for miles around there was nothing except a long, deserted, straight road. It was discovered that a bus passed on this route every morning from which fuel could be purchased. Kamal Amrohi decided to spend the night in desert he ordered his unit roll up the windows of the cars and hope for the best. A little after midnight the occupants of the vehicles were surrounded by a dozen armed men. The men knocked on the closed windows and forced their way in. when the armed gang leader learned that one of the persons in the car was Meena Kumari, his attitude completely changed. He turned out to be a Meena Kumari fan and welcomed his guests in true fan tradition. He organized music, dancing, and food. He provided place to sleep. He instructed his juniors the next morning to fetch petrol for the unit. From Meena Kumari, he wanted a special favour. He sharpened his knife and took it to her. \u2018Please autograph my hand with this,\u2019 he requested. Meena was not new to signing autographs but she had never attempted anything as ambitious as a knife. Nervously, she wrote her name on this man's hand. He said he was grateful for this favour. Once the unit left, they found at the next town that they had spent the night in the camp of Madhya Pradesh's renowned and dangerous dacoit\u2014Amrit Lal.\" Khursheed Said \"It was just work between them, Meena had no feeling left for Kamal and if he thinks anything else he is fooling himself.\" \"I has lived with Pakeezah almost aslong as i lived with its creator ... to Meena Kumari Pakeezah means a performance. A great performance? That is not for me to say: that is for people to decide. For me to say is this: it is a performance to deliver which I have, as an actress, had to delve deeper into the secret wells of being than any actor or actress normally delves in the process of his or her professional work.\" Pakeezah released on 3 February 1972, with a grand premiere at Maratha Mandir theatre in central Mumbai. Meena Kumari arrived to attend the last premiere of her life. Kumari let Raaj Kumar, for the benefit of the press, Raaj Kumar kissed her hand and then she went in to see the film. Meena Kumari seated next with Kamal Amrohi during the premiere. When Mohammed Zahur Khayyam complimented Meena Kumari with \"shahkar ban gaya\" (it's priceless), she was in tears. After watching complete Pakeezah Kumari told a friend that she was convinced that her husband was the finest film-maker in India. Kumari regarded the film as Kamal Amrohi tribute to her. Meena Kumari posthumously received her twelfth and last Filmfare nomination for Pakeezah. Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards bestowed Special award to Meena Kumari for Pakeezah in 1973.The film has since gained a cult and classic status, and Meena Kumari's performance as a golden-hearted Lucknow Nautch Girl drew major praise.

Meena Kumari died on Good Friday 31 March 1972 of liver cirrhosis at age 38. As per husband Kamal Amrohi's wish, Meena Kumari was buried at Rahematabad Qabristan located at Narialwadi, Mazgaon, Mumbai. She ended life with a broken fiddle, With a broken song, With a broken heart, But not a single regret. Kamal Amrohi stated,\" Once people took away my Manju after naming her Meena Kumari, Now this cruel death has snatched her away from everybody, But i know she is not dead, She is sleeping in my heart in an immortal sleep.\" (Kamal Amrohi died February 11, 1993 in Mumbai and as per his wish buried next to Meena Kumari's grave at Rahematabad Qabristan located at Narialwadi, Mazagaon, Mumbai.) Sahir Ludhianvi about Meena Kumari, \"An artiste with rare talent, a soft spoken woman in white with a soul of a poet her whole life was a sacrifice of her own emotions, her personality, her own ego and their sublimation in the art that gives joy to millions. A cruel destiny put her lily-white soul on the cross of human emotion. Dilip Kumar lamented, \"31 March 1972 was an unfortunate day since on this day in front of their own eyes they had seen helplessly the slow going away of a dear friend.\" \"\"Of the mountainous films Meena made,her performance in \u2018Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam\u2019 stands on the pinnacle . If I wish to remember my heroine as a film star I would remember her as Guru Dutt's Chhoti Bahu.\" Dev Anand concluded,\" Meena Kumari was the greatest artiste of them all. I regret there was no recognition of her historionic talent.\" Raaj Kumar was confident that \" She would live for all time to come.\" Burjor Khurshedji Karanjia editor Filmfare, \"She made a lot of money and lost it, she knew great love and lost that too. Across those exquisite sculptured features, the marble made flesh, flustered the bemused query.\" Baldev Raj Chopra producer director wrote \" Meena Kumari is no more. It almost appears that, with her death, we are reaching the end of an era of great artistes dedicated and larger than life.\" Mr V. Verma said,\" She had combined in herself two radical opposites, the grace of Moghul like live living and the spontaneity of a hippie.\" Gulzar writes \"Meena...closed her eyes and went to sleep/Bidding life adieu! Never once did she breathe Thereafter/ After a trying life full of struggle and strife,/ Wasn\u2019t it a remarkably stark and easy death!\" Khwaja Ahmad Abbas tributed,\" Martyrs never die. And it was Meena Kumari the mortal human being that was buried in a grave. Her soul, her art, is beyond decay.\" Meena Kumari was also a talented poet under the pseudonym Naaz. According to Naushad Ali, Kumari's poetry clearly reflected her angst. Haunting, crystalline, and precisely observed, Kumari's poetry reveals a side of her personality that was rarely on display in her films. It proved that she was a much more sensitive and self-aware woman than her fans tend to realise. \u062a\u0645 \u06a9\u064a\u0627 \u06a9\u0631\u0648\u06af\u06d2 \u0633\u0646 \u06a9\u0631 \u0645\u062c\u06be \u0633\u06d2 \u0645\u064a\u0631\u06cc \u06a9\u06c1\u0627\u0646\u06cc\n\u0628\u06d2 \u0644\u0637\u0641 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u06a9\u06d2 \u0642\u0635\u06d2 \u06c1\u064a\u06ba \u067e\u06be\u06cc\u06a9\u06d2 \u067e\u06be\u06cc\u06a9\u06d2 \"Tum kya karo ge sun kar mujh se meri kahani\nBay lutf zindagi ke qissay hain pheekay pheekay\"\n\n(Why do you want to listen to my story:\nColourless tales of a joyless life) \"This is Life\" My heart wonders incessantly\nIf this is life, what is it that they call death?\nLove was a dream?\nAsk not about the fate of this dream?\nAsk not about the punishment\nI received for the crime of loyalty Meena Kumari made waves as an actor beyond compare in the 60s.

Meena Kumari had helped Dharmendra enormously in the initial stages of his career and established Dharmendra's acting career in Indian Cinema. Javed Akhtar share \"Young Indian women's imitate Meena Kumari's styles, by emulating Kumari's degnified sober fashion styles, the way Kumari wear saree, her hair style, her bindi style, and this was the first time an Indian actress achieved such status and fame. Meena Kumari became the \"First Female Style Icon of Indian Cinema.\" A postal stamp was issued in honour of Meena Kumari on 13 February 2011 by India Post.

It was specially beamed towards Lahore nearby, in Pakistan. Thousands flocked at Lahore, from as far as Karachi, hundreds of miles away, to see Pakeezah. It was a flood the crowds stampeded the streets of Lahore to get to the television screens placed at strategic points on virtually every street corner.

She recalls Meena Kumari sobbing inconsolably long after the director had called \u2018cut', so deeply did she immerse herself in the role. Historian critic Philip Bounds and researcher Daisy Hasan write regarding Meena Kumari's legacy of poetry, \"Poetry was the medium through which Kumari distanced herself from her public image and criticised the industry that had brought her to public attention in the first place. In that sense her poems tell us as much about Bollywood as they do about herself.\" Javed Akhtar narrates \"Kamal sahab gave me a job and helped me. My salary was Rs.50 and even in the 60s you could not rent a house in that much money. I used to sleep in a corner of the studio. I started living in the costume room of the studio. I didn\u2019t have enough money to even go out to have a meal. In the evenings I would just potter around in the drawers. There were many cupboards filled with costumes of Pakeezah sherwanis, dresses, shoes. One day I opened a drawer, and found amid the clutter, three Filmfare trophies. I dusted them and realized they were Meena Kumari's Filmfare trophies. I had never held a trophy and a Filmfare trophy was akin to the Oscar of India. There were big mirrors in the room. In the evenings I would come back and lock myself in the costume room and hold the trophies in front of the mirror, acting how I would accept it if I were to receive it. The first trophy I held in my hand was that of Meena Kumari's! I was an eighteen-year-old boy who had no home, no money no food, but these trophies encouraged me to achieve my dreams and for this i will be always thankful to Meena ji.\" Meena Kumari thought for a moment and said, \"Meena Kumari's life was other people's destination. For her own self it was a road leading nowhere \u2026 to no point of arrival \u2026 all right, Khuda Hafiz.\". Satyajit Ray said \" I saw Meena Kumari's Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam she was undoubtedly an actress of the highest calibre.\" Music Director Naushad says that \"Meena throughout her short life was exploited by people for their own ends, and was so frustrated that she took to drinking and writing poetry to fight her feeling of betrayal.\"  Due to the contrast between her stardom and troubled private life, Kumari is closely linked to broader discussions about modern phenomena such as mass media, fame, and consumer culture.

        "artist_name": "Nanda_(actress)", 
        "biography": " Nanda (8 January 1939 \u2013 25 March 2014) was an Indian film actress who appeared in Hindi and Marathi films. She was best known for her performances in films like Ittefaq, Joru Ka Ghulam, Neend Hamare Khwab Tumhare, Kanoon, Pati Patni, Gumnaam, Akashdeep, Bedaag and Raja Saab.   Nanda was born in a Maharashtrian show-business family to Vinayak Damodar Karnataki (Master Vinayak), a successful Marathi actor-producer-director. Her father died in 1947, aged 41 when Nanda was eight years old. The family faced hard times. She became a child actress, helping her family by working in films in the early 1950s. She made her debut with Mandir in 1948. On the silver screen she was first recognized as \"Baby Nanda\". In films like Mandir, Jaggu, Angaarey, and Jagriti, she was a child actor between 1948-56. As a result of her involvement in movies, her studies suffered, and she was coached at home by renowned school teacher and Bombay Scouts commissioner, Gokuldas V. Makhi. By taking up a career in films, she supported and educated her six siblings. One of her brothers is Marathi film director Jaiprakash Karnataki. Actress Jayashree Talpade is her sister-in-law. Nanda's paternal uncle, the renowned film producer -director V. Shantaram gave Nanda a big break by casting her in a successful brother-sister saga Toofan Aur Diya (1956).It was the saga of an orphaned brother and sister pair that is buffeted by a series of tragic setbacks, including the girl losing her sight. She received her first Filmfare Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress for Bhabhi (1957); she claims that the reason she didn't win was because there was lobbying involved. She played supporting roles to stars like Dev Anand in Kala Bazar, and played second lead in Dhool Ka Phool. She played the title role in L.V. Prasad's Chhoti Bahen (1959). The movie was a big hit, making her a star. In this commercially successful 1959 film, Nanda played the blind younger sister looked after by two elder brothers, played by Balraj Sahni and Rehman. She then played lead roles, such as one of Dev Anand\u2019s heroines in Hum Dono (1961) and Teen Deviyan. Both films were acclaimed as \"hits\". She was the heroine in B R Chopra's Kanoon (1960), a film with no songs, which was then rare. She won the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award for Anchal (1960).She was paired with Raj Kapoor in Aashiq(1962) and she worked with Rajendra Kumar in 3 films - Toofan Aur Diya(1956), Dhool Ka Phool(1961), Kanoon(1960). In one of her interviews she said she avoided films with Shammi Kapoor because of his \"wild\" reputation from 1959\u201372, but later did accept work with him in Prem Rog in 1982.She had quoted in one of here interviews \"Many of my great performances were in films that failed or did average business, like \u2018Usne Kaha Tha\u2019, \u2018Char Diwari\u2019, \u2018Nartaki\u2019, and Aaj Aur Kal.\" She was the second highest paid Hindi actress along with Nutan from 1960-65, and the second highest paid Hindi actress between 1966-69 along-with Nutan and Waheeda, and the third highest paid Hindi actress, along-with Sadhana, from 1970-73. Nanda was known to encourage newcomers. She signed 8 films with Shashi Kapoor at a time when he was yet to become successful in Hindi Cinema. Their first 2 films as a pair - the critically acclaimed romantic film Char Diwari (1961) and \"Mehndi Lagi Mere Haath\" (1962) - did not work but the rest were successful at the box office. Shashi, who though had achieved success in English films in 1963 and in 2 Hindi films in 1965, had 5 flops as solo lead hero from his debut in 1961 till 1965 in Hindi films. In Jab Jab Phool Khile (1965), Nanda played a westernised role for the first time and it helped her image. Her favorite song that was famously picturized on her in the film was \"Yeh Samaa.\" Shashi would later declare that Nanda was his favorite heroine. Nanda, too, declared Kapoor as her favourite hero. In the period 1965-1970, the successful films of the pair Shashi-Nanda include Mohabbat Isko Kahete Hain (1965), Jab Jab Phool Khile (1965), Neend Hamari Khwab Tumhare (1966), Raja Saab (1969) and Rootha Na Karo (1970). In the early 1970s, Nanda suggested Rajendra Kumar, co-producer of The Train, to take Rajesh Khanna as the main lead. She had another hit film in 1965 with Gumnaam, which helped put her in the top league of heroines. With Dharmendra, she worked in Mera Kasoor Kya Hai and Akashdeep. She played lead heroine roles beginning with Choti Bhehan and Kanoon from 1959\u201360 and continued to get roles as the main female lead till 1973.She signed with new leading man Rajesh Khanna in the songless suspense thriller Ittefaq (1969) for which she received a Filmfare nomination as Best Actress and which became successful at the box office. After Khanna became a super-star, he signed two more films with her: the thriller The Train (1970) and a comedy Joroo Ka Ghulam (1972) which became hits. Jeetendra, too, had some hit films with her like Parivar, Dharti Kahe Pukar Ke; with Sanjay Khan, she had a hit in Beti and Abhilasha, but offers dried up from 1973 as her pairing with other younger actors like Navin Nischol, Vinod Mehra, Deb Mukerji and Parikshat Sahni did not work. The 3 films Ittefaq, The Train and Joru Ka Ghulam - earned more than her earlier hits opposite Shashi Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar, Dev Anand, Sanjeev Kumar and Jeetendra. After a small role in Manoj Kumar's Shor (1972), Nanda did few more critically acclaimed films such as Chhalia (1973), Naya Nasha (1974), which flopped and she then stopped acting. In 1982, she came back with three successful films, all coincidentally having her play Padmini Kolhapure's mother in Ahista Ahista, Mazdoor and Raj Kapoor's Prem Rog. Then she permanently retired. Nanda, who has done some unforgettable work in Bollywood and has given films like like \u2018Dhool Ka Phool\u2019, \u2018Dulhan\u2019, \u2018Bhabhi\u2019, \u2018Jab Jab Phool Khile\u2019, \u2018Gumnaam\u2019, \u2018Shor\u2019, \u2018Parineeta\u2019, and \u2018Prem Rog\u2019 was one of the highest paid actresses of her time. She was the second highest paid Hindi actress along-with Nutan from 1960-1965 and second highest paid Hindi actress in 1966-1969 along-with Nutan and Waheeda and third highest paid Hindi actress with Sadhana from 1970-1973. In 1965, while filming Jab Jab Phool Khile, director Suraj Prakash recalled that a Maharashtrian lieutenant colonel was smitten by Nanda and had asked him to forward his marriage proposal to her mother. In the end, nothing came of it. Nanda's brothers brought home many suitors for her, but she turned them all down. In 1992, a middle-aged Nanda became engaged to director Manmohan Desai at the urging of Rehman. But he died after falling from the terrace of his rented flat in Girgaon, just a year after her mother died of cancer. According to reports, the railing he was leaning on collapsed. Nanda remained unmarried. Nanda lived in her residence in Mumbai interacting only with family and close friends. Her close friends from the film industry included Waheeda Rehman, Shammi, Asha Parekh, Helen, Saira Banu, Mala Sinha, Sadhana Shivdasani, Shakila and Jabeen Jaleel. After a long time she made a public appearance with Waheeda Rehman for a screening of the Marathi film Natarang (2010). She died in Mumbai on 25 March 2014 at her Versova residence, aged 75, following a heart attack."

Regarded as one of the greatest actresses in the history of Hindi cinema, she made her screen debut as a child in Talash-E-Haq in 1935, but her acting career began in 1942 with Tamanna (1942). During a career that spanned from the 1940s to the 1960s, Nargis appeared in numerous commercially successful as well as critically appreciated films, many of which featured her alongside actor Raj Kapoor. One of her best-known roles was that of Radha in the Academy Award-nominated Mother India (1957), a performance that won her Best Actress trophy at the Filmfare Awards. In 1958, Nargis married her Mother India co-star, actor Sunil Dutt, and left the film industry. She would appear infrequently in films during the 1960s. Some of her films of this period include the drama Raat Aur Din (1967), for which she was given the inaugural National Film Award for Best Actress. Along with her husband, Nargis formed the Ajanta Arts Cultural Troupe, which roped in several leading actors and singers of the time and held stage shows at border areas. In early 1970s, she became the first patron of Spastics Society of India, and her subsequent work with the organisation brought her recognition as a social worker, and later a Rajya Sabha nomination in 1980. Nargis died in 1981 of pancreatic cancer, a few days before her son Sanjay Dutt made his debut in Hindi films. In 1982, the Nargis Dutt Memorial Cancer Foundation was established in her memory. The award for Best Feature Film on National Integration in the annual National Film Awards ceremony is called the Nargis Dutt Award in her honour. In 1958, she was honoured with the Padma Shri by the Government of India.   Nargis was born as Fatima Rashid in Calcutta, Bengal (now Kolkata, West Bengal). Her father Abdul Rashid alias Mohan Babu, was originally a wealthy Mohyal Tyagi (a Punjabi Hindu), from Rawalpindi, Punjab (now in Pakistan) who had converted to Islam. Her mother was Jaddanbai, a Hindustani classical music singer and one of the early pioneers of Indian cinema. She introduced Nargis into the movie culture unfolding in India at the time. Nargis' maternal half-brother, Anwar Hussain (1928\u20131988), also became a film actor. Fatima made her first film appearance in the 1935 film Talashe Haq when she was six years old, credited as \"Baby Nargis\". Nargis (\u0646\u0631\u06af\u0633 [\u02c8n\u0259r\u0261\u026as]) is a Persian word meaning Narcissus, the daffodil flower. She was subsequently credited as Nargis in all of her films.

Baburao Patel of the film magazine Filmindia (December 1957) described Mother India as \"the greatest picture produced in India\" and wrote that no other actress would have been able to perform the role as well as Nargis. After her marriage to Sunil Dutt in 1958, Nargis gave up her film career to settle down with her family, after her last few films were released. She made her last film appearance in the 1967 film Raat Aur Din. The film was well received and Nargis' performance as a woman who suffers from multiple-personality disorder, was critically acclaimed. For this role she won a National Film Award for Best Actress and became the first actress to win in this category. She also received a Filmfare Best Actress Award nomination for this film. In 2011, Rediff.com listed her as the greatest actress of all time, stating, \"An actress with range, style, grace and an incredibly warm screen presence, Nargis is truly a leading lady to celebrate.\" M.L. Dhawan from The Tribune said, \"In almost all her films Nargis created a woman who could be desired and deified. The charisma of Nargis's screen image lay in that it oscillated between the simple and the chic with equal ease.\" She was also nominated to the Rajya Sabha (Upper house of Indian Parliament) from 1980\u201381 but due to cancer she fell ill and died during her tenure. Nargis had a long-time relationship with actor Raj Kapoor, who was her co-star in the films Awara and Shree 420. Raj Kapoor was married and had children. After he refused to divorce his wife, Nargis ended their year-long relationship. Nargis married actor Sunil Dutt (a Mohyal from Jhelum, British India) on March 11, 1958.

Sanjay went on to become a successful film actor. Namrata married actor Kumar Gaurav, son of veteran actor Rajendra Kumar who had appeared alongside Nargis and Sunil Dutt in Mother India. Priya became a politician and a Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha). With her husband, Nargis formed the Ajanta Arts Cultural Troupe, which involved several leading actors and singers of the time, and performed at remote frontiers to entertain the Indian soldiers at border. It was the first troupe to perform in Dhaka, after the liberation war of Bangladesh in 1971. Later, Nargis worked for the cause of spastic children.

Zameer Uddin Shah (PVSM, SM, VSM) Former Deputy Chief of The Army Staff, former member Armed Forces Tribunal and currently the Vice Chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim University, who is also speculated to be the next Vice President Of India.   Shah was born into a Muslim family in Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, India, as one of the three sons of Aley Mohammed Shah and his wife Farrukh Sultan. He is a descendant of a 19th-century Sayyid Afghan warlord Jan-Fishan Khan (Sayyid Muhammad Shah), who participated in the First Anglo-Afghan War and helped the British in the subsequent Indian Rebellion of 1857. Shah did his schooling at St. Anselm's Ajmer and St Joseph's College, Nainital. He graduated in arts from Aligarh Muslim University in 1971 and attended National School of Drama in Delhi. His elder brother, Lt. General Zameerud-din Shah (Retd.) PVSM, SM, VSM, is current Vice-Chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University, whose son Mohommed Ali Shah is an actor.

He strongly believed that the distinction between art and commercial films had largely reduced, especially with the directors of the former also making commercial films. In 2000, his dream of playing Mahatma Gandhi was realised when he played Gandhi in Kamal Hassan's critically acclaimed Hey Ram which focused on the assassination of Gandhi from the assailant's point of view. Shah won critical acclaim by playing the role of Mohit, the drunken coach to a deaf and mute boy in Iqbal, which was written by Vipul K Rawal with Shah specially in mind.[citation needed] Shah was praised for his roles in the 1999 Aamir Khan-starrer Sarfarosh, where he played Gulfam Hassan\u00a0\u2013 a ghazal singer-cum-terrorist mastermind\u00a0\u2014 and in Neeraj Pandey's critically acclaimed A Wednesday (2008). Shah has also starred in international projects, such as Monsoon Wedding in 2001 and a Hollywood comic book adaptation The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen in 2003 (co-starring Sean Connery), where he played the role of Captain Nemo. His portrayal of Nemo was very close to the design of the graphic novel, although his Nemo was far less manic. He worked in Vishal Bhardwaj's Indian adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth, titled Maqbool, in 2003, and Rajiv Rai's Asambhav opposite Arjun Rampal and Priyanka Chopra in 2004. He then went on to work in The Great New Wonderful (2005). In 2011, Shah was seen in The Dirty Picture. He acted in Anup Kurian's The Blueberry Hunt, playing a recluse growing marijuana in his forest retreat, and in Waiting, starring opposite Kalki Koechlin, both of which were released in 2016. Shah made his Pakistani film debut in Khuda Ke Liye by Shoaib Mansoor, where he played a short cameo. His second Pakistani film Zinda Bhaag was selected as the country's official entry to the 86th Academy Awards for the Best Foreign Language Film award. Naseeruddin Shah has been giving performances with his theatre troupe at places such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Lahore. He has directed plays written by Lavender Kumar, Ismat Chughtai and Saadat Hasan Manto. His directorial debut in movies, Yun Hota To Kya Hota, was released in 2006. It stars several established actors such as Konkona Sen Sharma, Paresh Rawal, Irfan Khan, then-newcomer Ayesha Takia, his son Imaad Shah and his old friend Ravi Baswani.[citation needed] In 1977, Shah, Tom Alter and Benjamin Gilani formed a theatre group called Motley Productions. Their first play was Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, which was staged at the Prithvi Theatre on 29 July 1979. In 1988, he acted in the eponymous television series based on the life and times of Mirza Ghalib, directed by Gulzar and telecast on DD National. In 1989, he acted as the Maratha King Shivaji in another eponymous television series Bharat Ek Khoj based on Jawaharlal Nehru's book The Discovery of India. In mid 1990s, Shah also hosted some episodes of science magazine programme Turning Point. In 1999, he acted as a special agent in the TV series Tarkash on Zee TV. He played the role of a retired agent haunted by nightmares who is re-inducted as he apparently knows something about a dreaded terrorist somehow connected with his past.[citation needed] In 1998, he played the role of Mahatma Gandhi in the play Mahatma Vs. Gandhi, (which looked at the Mahatma's relation with Harilal Gandhi, his first son). With this, he achieved his objective of portraying Mahatma Gandhi, a role he had auditioned for in Richard Attenborough's Gandhi. In 2000, he again portrayed the Mahatma, this time on film, in Hey Ram. He played the villain with the dual identity of a ghazal singer and a Pakistani spy who supports terrorism in India in Sarfarosh (1999). He was the first of several celebrity actors, who played the role of narrator in the popular audiobook series for kids Karadi Tales. He was the narrator in the film Paheli\u00a0\u2014 the Indian entry to the 2006 Academy Awards. When he was between 19 and 20 years of age, Shah married 36-year-old Manara Sikri, also known as Parveen Murad. His wife, who was the sister of actress Surekha Sikri, was a divorced woman and had children from her previous marriage. Shah faced resistance from his parents and siblings to the idea of this marriage, but he went ahead nevertheless. Within one year of the wedding, the couple became the parents of a daughter, the stage actress Heeba Shah. By this time, the marriage was on the rocks, and the couple separated when Heeba was about one year old. However, they were not divorced for many years, because in his nikaahnama (Muslim marriage contract), Shah had firstly promised a massive amount of money to his wife as mehr (alimony) in case of a divorce, and secondly disclaimed the right to bigamy . His wife, whose first marriage had ended bitterly, and whose first divorce had not (in her opinion) yielded her enough money, had been determined to ensure that the same situation was not repeated in her second marriage. It took more than twelve years for Naseeruddin Shah to put together the colossal amount of money which he had fecklessly promised as a teenager, and it was not until 1982 that he was rid of his first wife and free to marry his next. Meanwhile, Manara and Heeba moved to Iran in the early 1970s, shortly after the couple separated, and Shah was not permitted by his wife to have any contact with their daughter, despite the fact that no divorce had been formalized. The situation was only remedied when Heeba, having become an adult, herself sought out her father and established contact with him. She later moved to India and, having never married, lives with her father, step-mother and half-brothers. Manara died in Iran in the 1990s, after having gone through yet another divorce. Meanwhile, in the 1970s, Shah had met and fallen in love with Ratna Pathak, a stage and film actress, and the daughter of Dina Pathak, a well-respected character actress. Ratna's sister, the actress Supriya Pathak, is married to the actor Pankaj Kapoor, who is the father of Shahid Kapoor by his first marriage. During the 70s and 80s, Naseeruddin Shah and Ratna Pathak co-starred in several films like Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na, Mirch Masala and The Perfect Murder. They were in a live-in relationship for many years, while Shah put together the mehr required to divorce Manara. Shah and Pathak were finally married in 1982. By his second marriage, Shah has two sons, Imaad and Vivaan, both of who are aspiring actors. The couple lives in Mumbai with Heeba, Imaad and Vivaan. Shah's memoir is titled And Then One Day, and was published by Hamish Hamilton. "

The director duo Krishnan-Panju, who had directed Do Kaliyaan, suggested K.Spaniards, that he can take Neetu Singh to rerpise the role played by Manjula Vijayakumar in the original. This paved the way for Neetu Singh's debut at the age of 15 as the lead heroine. However the remake was a flop. She took a small role as the dancer in Yaadon Ki Baarat (1973), which became a hit, and her dance number to the song Lekar Hum brought her so much attention that she was immediately offered lead roles again. In most films, Neetu was cast as the fun-loving daughter or the 'optimistic' or 'lively' girlfriend. She acted with the top stars of her day.She was paired with her future brother-in-law Randhir Kapoor in Heeralal Pannalal (1978), Bhala Manus, Kasme Vaade, Dhongee and in the delayed Nikkamma.

        "biography": " Neil Nitin Mukesh Chand Mathur (born 15 January 1982) better known as Neil Nitin Mukesh is an Indian actor who appears in Hindi-language films. He is the son and grandson of singers Nitin Mukesh and Mukesh, respectively. After brief roles as a child in Vijay (1988) and Jaisi Karni Waisi Bharnii (1989), Neil decided to venture into acting after graduating from HR College with a bachelor's degree in commerce. Neil made his debut as an adult in Sriram Raghavan's 2007 critically acclaimed thriller Johnny Gaddaar, which earned him a Filmfare Best Male Debut Award nomination. He subsequently earned critical praise for his performance in New York (2009) and Jail (2009); the former earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award. The actor was later noted for his performances in Lafangey Parindey (2010), 7 Khoon Maaf (2011) and David (2013). He debuted in Tamil cinema as the main antagonist in Kaththi (2014), for which he learned Tamil from scratch.   Neil was born Neil Nitin Mukesh Chand Mathur on 15 January 1982 in Mumbai, Maharashtra in a Hindu Kayastha family. His parents are Nishi Mukesh and Bollywood playback singer Nitin Mukesh, son of veteran singer Mukesh Chand Mathur. He was named by Lata Mangeshkar after the American astronaut Neil Armstrong. As a child, he appeared in Vijay (1988) and Jaisi Karni Waisi Bharnii (1989) as the younger versions of Rishi Kapoor and Govinda. Neil was educated at Greenlawns High School and HR College in Mumbai, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in commerce at his father's insistence. He then decided to pursue a career in acting, despite being born into a family of singers. In an interview with The Times of India, the actor said \"Music is my hobby, but acting is my passion. A passion that even my grand-dad harboured. So, while my father continued his legacy and became a singer, I pursued his other passion. I am living his dream\". Neil trained at a four-month workshop at the Kishore Namit Kapoor Acting Institute, and received training from actor Anupam Kher. Neil made his debut in Sriram Raghavan's 2007 thriller Johnny Gaddaar. His portrayal of a crook received positive reviews from critics and earned him a Best Male Debut nomination at the 53rd Filmfare Awards. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama described Neil as a \"complete natural\": \"The youngster carries off the part with dexterity. There's just one word to describe his performance\u00a0\u2013 superb!\" However, despite critical acclaim the film failed to do well at the box office. Neil's first 2009 film was the science-fiction thriller Aa Dekhen Zara co-starring with Bipasha Basu, he played a struggling photographer who inherits a camera (whose photos predict the future) from his scientist grandfather. The film was a critical and commercial failure. His performance received mixed reviews from critics; while Nikhat Kazmi described him as charming and effortless, Raja Sen of Rediff.com said he \"seems to have cleverly picked another character that doesn't require him to act much beyond the fish-out-of-water routine\". His next appearance was in Kabir Khan's action-drama New York with John Abraham, Katrina Kaif and Irrfan Khan. Exploring the aftermath of 9/11, the film was a critical and commercial success, earning over \u20b9610 million (US$9.4\u00a0million) worldwide. His performance was praised by critics, earning him a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the 55th Filmfare Awards. Subhash K Jha wrote, \"Neil as the sophomore with stars and stripes in his eyes is fully convincing credible and supportive of the two central performances\". His final film of the year was Madhur Bhandarkar's Jail, a drama revolving around the cruel reality faced by prisoners in Indian jails. The film's aesthetically shot nude scene (demonstrating the torture Neil's character received in jail) and a masturbation scene sparked controversy; as a result, the latter scene was shortened. Neil remarked, \"My nude or masturbation scenes are not for titillation. It's a very practical need in the script. My character is in jail without sex for 2-1/2 years. What does he do? He naturally seeks pleasure by himself.\" A commercial failure, the film and his performance were praised by critics. Taran Adarsh wrote, \"Not only does Neil Nitin Mukesh deliver his finest performance to date, but the performance would easily rank amongst the finest this year. He conveys the pathos and helplessness that this character demands with amazing understanding. He deserves all praise for his extra-ordinary portrayal\". In 2010, Neil featured in Pradeep Sarkar's romantic drama Lafangey Parindey with Deepika Padukone. While the film received mixed reviews, his portrayal of a fighter was appreciated by critics. According to Sify's Sonia Chopra, Neil's \"underplayed acting style complements the character's sketch perfectly\". Blessy Chettiar of Daily News and Analysis noted, \"He looks great in every frame and carries off [the character's] rugged demeanour with panache\". Lafangey Parindey was a moderate commercial success, with a worldwide revenue of \u20b9310 million (US$4.8\u00a0million). Neil then starred in Sudhir Mishra's dramatic thriller, Tera Kya Hoga Johnny. He has also been a brand ambassador to one of the leading clothing brands of the country, Oxemberg, in April, 2010. The following year Neil starred in Vishal Bhardwaj's 7 Khoon Maaf, a black comedy (based on Ruskin Bond's short story, \"Susanna's Seven Husbands\") featuring Priyanka Chopra as a woman who murders her seven husbands in an unending quest for love. The actor was cast as Chopra's first husband, Major Edwin Rodriques, an arrogant, jealous and possessive army officer who lost a leg in Punjab's Operation Blue Star in 1984. The film premiered at the 61st Berlin Film Festival; it was a commercial failure, receiving a mixed response from critics, but Neil's performance was praised. Nikhat Kazmi wrote that he \"excelled as the brute\". In 2012, Neil starred in Abbas-Mustan's Players as part of an ensemble cast including Abhishek Bachchan, Sonam Kapoor, Bipasha Basu and Bobby Deol. The film was a remake of the 2003 Hollywood heist thriller, The Italian Job; it was also a commercial failure, receiving mixed-to-negative reviews from critics (as did Neil's performance). Subhash K Jha said he \"brings a mean menacing tone to the villainy\"; according to Rediff.com's Sukanya Verma, Mukesh \"mistakes sinister for superficial, resulting in a truly phony performance\". In 2013, Neil worked in three films, though all were commercially unsuccessful. His first release was Bejoy Nambiar's action-drama David, in which he played a gangster whose boss controls the Asian community in 1970's London. The actor said his character's dual personality appealed to him: \"Here was this hardcore, extremely violent gangster and on the other hand, my director wanted me to show the emotional and romantic side to him too\". The film received mixed reviews, but Neil's performance was critically acclaimed. Writing for The Times of India, Madhureeta Mukherjee described it as \"restrained and powerful\" and CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand said that Mukesh is \"nicely understated\". He next appeared opposite Sonal Chauhan in Eros International's horror film 3G. Filmed in Fiji, the film told the story of how the duo face supernatural occurrences when they buy a 3G-enabled phone. The film was not well received by critics. In a review for Rediff.com, Ankur Pathak said that Neil is \"aggressively over the top\" and added that his \"body language is consistently uncomfortable.\" He also appeared in Susi Ganeshan's crime thriller Shortcut Romeo with Ameesha Patel and Puja Gupta. The picture ran into trouble when it got a limited release by its producers, and emerged as a major commercial failure. On his performance, Madhureeta Mukherjee of The Times of India said: \"Neil performs well as always, he looks good (he needs to tone down his physicality for such roles) and proves that actors like him need better scripts to justify their true potential.\" Neil has completed work on two films\u2014Prerna Wadhwan's romantic drama Ishqeria, which will see him star opposite Richa Chadda and Manish Vatsalya's Dussehra, where Neil will feature as an encounter specialist with Tena Desae. He debuted in Tamil cinema with AR Murugadoss's Kaththi. He also acted in Sooraj R. Barjatya's 2015 family drama Prem Ratan Dhan Payo with Salman Khan and Sonam Kapoor. He also made a guest appearance in Wazir. In 2009, Neil started an NGO to support and help needy women by providing them with food, shelter and vocational training to support themselves. The philanthropic project was named for his grandmother, Saral Devi. The actor said, \"I have read about women getting oppressed, exploited by men and other family members. They get sold like commodities and are driven into prostitution. I'm always pained to hear all this and at the back of my mind I had thought that I would start an organisation to support such women.\" In 2012, he joined with Volkswagen in support of an environmental campaign called \"Think Blue\", an initiative increasing awareness of water scarcity and other pressing ecological issues. Neil participated in the Hiru Golden Film Awards 2016 in Sri Lanka as a special guest along with Bollywood actors such as Sunil Shetty, Jackie Shroff, and actresses Sridevi, Madhuri Dixit and Karishma Kapoor."

Nutan had to be persuaded to act in the film as she had quit acting post marriage. Bandini was a major critical success, which was attributed by critics mostly to Nutan's portrayal, which is regarded as one of the finest performances in the history of Indian cinema. The film won the Filmfare Award for Best Movie and she received her third Best Actress Award. The Bengal Film Journalists' Association, while ranking the film as the third-best Indian film of the year, acknowledged her with the Best Actress (Hindi section) award. Author and critic Dinesh Raheja wrote, \"Sans screaming hysteria-nics, Nutan puts across one of the finest performances seen on Hindi screen. She recognised and was perfectly in tandem with Kalyani's innate strength of character.\" Film and theatre critic Gautaman Bhaskaran wrote for The Hindu, \"Nutan as Kalyani gave perhaps her career's best performance. Splendidly expressive, her understated role is something that cannot be easily matched by today's painted heroines. Fear and anger show up so lividly in Nutan's eyes that they haunt you long after you have walked out of the theatre.\" In 2010, Filmfare included her performance in its \"80 Iconic Performances\" list. Anupama Chopra included the film in her list of \"The 20 Best Hindi Films Ever Made\", calling her role \"one of Hindi cinema\u2019s most complex and fully realized female characters,\" and further noting, \"This was the role of a lifetime and Nutan, who ... gave it all. Her face raged with a grand passion and a quiet grace.\" In 2013, conducting a list of \"25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema\" in celebration of a hundred years of Indian cinema, Forbes India included Nutan's performance, hailing her work as \"the best acting by a lead actress in Indian cinema\". Her fourth Filmfare Award came for Milan (1967). She starred opposite Amitabh Bachchan in 1973's Saudagar (1973), for which she received a sixth Filmfare nomination and a third BFJA award. In 1978, she made an astonishing return to the screen as the righteous Sanjukta Chauhan in Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki (1978). For this performance, she received an eighth Filmfare career nomination and won her fifth Filmfare best actress award, at the age of 42. She thus became a record holder in the category, having won five award for Best Actress at Filmfare. At age 42, she is also the oldest winner of the award. Nutan was perhaps the only actress of her generation to command leading roles in her 40s, with tremendous success. Following this, she starred in Saajan ki Saheli (1981), as an ignorant, jealous wife to a husband who knowingly befriends the daughter she abandoned at childbirth. In the remaining 1980s she played roles in blockbuster films such as Meri Jung (1985), Naam (1986) and Karma (1986). Karma was notable for being the first time she was paired with actor Dilip Kumar. For Mere Jung she won a Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her last film released while she was alive was Kanoon Apna Apna in 1989. She died in 1991 of cancer. Two of her films Naseebwala (1992) and Insaniyat (1994) were released after her death. She also gave a stellar performance as Kaliganj ki Bahu in TV serial Mujrim Hazir, her only role on small screen. Nutan was noted for her willingness to play unconventional roles and several of her roles were labelled \"path-breaking\". M.L. Dhawan from The Tribune wrote, \"When squeakers and screamers ruled the roost, Nutan fine-tuned her dialogue delivery with an evocative voice. A natural throw was the hallmark of Nutan\u2019s dialogue delivery. She was low key and mellow as she was peppery and sarcastic and yet made a strong impact.\" According to Dhawan, \"a fleeting expression on her face conveyed much more than dialogue,\" and he further noted her for accepting only roles in which \"she either played the main part or at least shared equal footing with the male counterpart.\" According to Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Nutan \"developed a natural acting style under Bimal Roy's direction.\" Actresses like Sadhana and Smita Patil noted Nutan as their influence. Sadhana was once quoted as saying, \"If there was any actress I modelled myself in the lines of it was the versatile Nutan in Seema, Sujata and Bandini. Parakh was a film where I really followed Nutan.\" Filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali said of her, \"They don't make actresses like her anymore.\" In 2011, Rediff.com listed her as the third-greatest actress of all-time. In 2013, while including her performance in Bandini in their list of \"25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema\", Forbes India observed, \"Nutan\u2019s genius lay in portraying a whole range of emotions without resorting to over-the-top histrionics.\" Nutan\u2019s narrative is depicted in the book Nutan \u2013 Asen Mi Nasen Mi written by famous Marathi author Lalita Tamhane. The book can be summarized as one describing Nutan\u2019s life experiences, interactions with co-actors/family/friends, etc., as told by her to Lalita Tamhane. A postage stamp, bearing her photo, was released to honour her by India\u2019s Minister of State for Communication and Information Technology in February 2011. On 11 October 1959, she married naval Lieutenant-Commander Rajnish Bahl, who died in 2004. Their son, Mohnish Bahl, born in 1961, later entered films as well. Nutan died in February 1991, of breast cancer after it had spread to her lungs, at the age of 54."

Kolhapure, at the age of fifteen won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the revenge drama Insaf Ka Tarazu (1981) and at the age of seventeen, won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for the tragic romance Prem Rog (1983), thus becoming the second youngest actress to win the awards in the respective categories.   Padmini Kolhapure was born second among the three daughters of Pandharinath Kolhapure, a professional musician, by his wife Anupama Kolhapure. Her older sister is the former actress Shivangi Kapoor, wife of actor Shakti Kapoor and mother of actor Siddhanth Kapoor and actress Shraddha Kapoor. Her younger sister is the actress Tejaswini Kolhapure. The family took the surname \"Kolhapure\" because they hailed from Kolhapur. Padmini's mother, Nirupama Kolhapure, was born into a Konkani-speaking konkani Brahmin family belonging to Mangalore in Karnataka. Padmini's father, Pandharinath Kolhapure, was a talented vocalist and Veena player. He was the son of Pandit Krishnarao Kolhapure (partner Balvant Natak Academy along with Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar), an exponent of Natya Sangeet who had enjoyed the patronage of the Baroda Durbar. Pandharinath's mother was the half-sister of Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar, and sister of Balwantrao Abhisheki, the father of vocalist Jitendra Abhisheki. Thus, Padmini is a niece of legendary singers Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhonsle. She formerly used to work as ground staff with Air India. While working for the film Aisa Pyar Kahan, Padmini met Pradeep Sharma, alias Tutu Sharma, who was the producer of the film. They were married after a brief courtship in 1986. They have a son named Priyank Sharma. Padmini and Pradeep celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary recently. As a child, she sang in the chorus for songs in films like Yaadon Ki Baaraat, Kitab and Dushman Dost with her sister Shivangi. Padmini later sang for her own films like Vidhaata (\"Saat Saheliyan\"), Hum Intezaar Karenge and Sadak Chaap (with Kishore Kumar). She released an album with Bappi Lahiri titled Music Lovers. She performed for the Greater London Council at the Royal Albert Hall in London with Bappi Lahiri and his troupe in 1986. Asha Bhosle suggested Padmini's name to Dev Anand, who then cast her in Ishq Ishq Ishq (1975). This led to other films, such as Dreamgirl (1978), Zindagi (1976), and Saajan Bina Suhagan (1978). She also gave a very commendable performance of a school girl inflicted by black magic in Gehrayee (1980). Her mother quit her airlines job to be a full-time chaperone as Padmini picked up more roles. Her most famous child role was playing a child in Raj Kapoor's 1977 film Satyam Shivam Sundaram. Her success led to her most controversial role in Insaaf Ka Tarazu (1980), a remake of Lipstick (1976), where she played the rape victim that was originally played by Mariel Hemingway. She earned the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award for her performance. She graduated to heroine roles at the age of 15 in Nasir Hussain's Zamane Ko Dikhana Hai opposite Rishi Kapoor. The film flopped, but she reunited with Rishi for his father Raj Kapoor's film Prem Rog in 1982. The film earned her a Filmfare Best Actress Award. She earned a special acting award for Ahista Ahista. Padmini was known for her professionalism and diligence..She even worked when she had fever on Do Dilon Ki Dastaan. She had more box office hits, such as Vidhaata (1982) and Souten (1983). She had a huge hit with Pyar Jhukta Nahin (1985) with Mithun Chakraborty, and they were paired together in several more films. She agreed to work with Anil Kapoor when he was a newcomer in his first film, Woh Saat Din (1983). The movie was a hit and helped cement his name in the Indian film industry; Anil Kapoor attributes his eventual success in the film industry to her 'luck'. After her son grew up, she returned to acting in 2004, such as for the Marathi films Manthan and Chimnee Pakhra, which was a huge hit and earned her a Screen Award in the Best Marathi Actress category. She appeared in the 2006 horror film Eight Shani. In 2011, she made her foray into Malayalam cinema with V. K. Prakash's Karmayogi, an adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet. She was considered to play the role of Tulsi Virani in Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi after Smriti Irani left the project, but the role was ultimately played by Gautami Kapoor. She appeared in Mera Bachpan with Helen in 2008. She has also acted on stage in Kaash, followed by Abhi To Mein Jawan Hoon and Aasman Se Gire Khajoor Pe Atke, with her brother-in-law Shakti Kapoor."

        "artist_name": "Parveen_Babi", 
        "biography": " Parveen Babi (4 April 1949\u00a0\u2013 20 January 2005) was an Indian actress, who is most remembered for her glamorous roles alongside top heroes of the 1970s and early 1980s in blockbusters like Deewar, Namak Halaal, Amar Akbar Anthony and Shaan.   Parveen was born in Junagadh, Gujarat to a Pathan Muslim family. She did her early schooling from Mount Carmel High School, Ahmedabad and later attended St. Xavier's College, Ahmedabad where she earned a Master of Arts in English literature. Her father, Vali Mohammed Babi, (died 1959), was a system administrator with the Nawab of Junagadh and Jamal Bakhte Babi (died 2001). Born in a feudal aristocratic family, her ancestors came from a lineage of Gujarat's historical Pathan community and belonged to the royal Babi Dynasty. Parveen was born fourteen years after the marriage of her parents and was their only child. She lost her father at the age of ten. Parveen never married but media tabloids speculated that she may have had relationships with men in the film-industry such as director Mahesh Bhatt as well as actors Kabir Bedi and Danny Denzongpa. She was also rumoured to have had an affair with her co-star of many films, Amitabh Bachchan, with whom she later developed irrational fears as she accused him of trying to kill her. Bhatt later wrote and directed Arth (1982), a supposedly semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with Babi, and wrote and produced Woh Lamhe (2006) based on his recollection and interpretation of his relationship with Parveen and without any inputs from her. It is uncertain whether Woh Lamhe is a truthful semi-autobiography of Babi rather the details of her character in the movie appears fabrication and manipulative narration of her life. Parveen's modelling career began in 1972 and was quickly followed by her film debut with the film Charitra (1973) opposite cricketer Salim Durani. The film was a resounding flop but Parveen was noticed and was snapped up for several more films. Her first major hit was Majboor (1974) opposite Amitabh Bachchan. Along with Zeenat Aman, Parveen Babi helped change the image of the Indian film heroine. She was the first Bollywood star to appear on the front page of the Time in July 1976, much to the amazement of her contemporaries. Throughout her career, she was thought of more as a glamorous heroine than a serious actress. She was also known as a fashion icon. Famous designer Manish Malhotra says, \"Parveen Babi brought minimalism into fashion. She was always impeccable, not overdoing it even once.\" Parveen was considered to be one of the most successful actresses of her era, along with Hema Malini, Rekha, Zeenat Aman, Jaya Bhaduri, Reena Roy and Raakhee. She starred opposite Amitabh Bachchan in eight films, all of which were either hits or super hits. She also starred in other hit films such as Suhaag (1979), Kaala Patthar (1979), and Namak Halaal (1982) opposite Shashi Kapoor, Kala Sona (1975) opposite Feroz Khan, Chandi Sona opposit Sanjay Khan and Jaani Dost (1983) opposite Dharmendra. Towards the end of her career, she appeared in offbeat films like Vinod Pande's Yeh Nazdeekiyan (1982), playing the role of the \"other woman\" opposite Marc Zuber, and Dil... Akhir Dil Hai (1982), opposite Naseeruddin Shah. She was often compared with her contemporary Zeenat Aman due to their common image of being sex-symbols. In fact, she acted alongside Zeenat Aman in Mahaan (1983) and Ashanti (1982) (inspired by the American television show Charlie's Angels, with the third role played by Shabana Azmi). In films like Deewar (1975), Shaan (1980) and Namak Halaal (1982), her screen presence may have been minimal as the films were largely worked around the hero, but Babi brought a certain attractive aloofness to the roles and songs she appeared in. In the big hit movie, Kranti (1981), she stole scenes through her supporting role from Hema Malini, the heroine of the film. Her memorable roles include Jenny in Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), Sunita in Shaan, Anita in Deewaar. She was also the original choice for the female protagonist in Silsila along with Smita Patil, but was later dropped by Yash Chopra, who stated that while Babi was fine, but Smita Patil was hurt, mainly because the filmmaker had asked actor friend Shashi Kapoor to pass the bad news to Smita. Finally, She \"disappeared\" from the film scene in 1983, without informing anyone about her whereabouts, a perception that allowed for exaggerated rumours and pompous claims to be whispered in the industry that she might be \"under the control\" of figures in the \"underworld\". Many of her completed films released in the following years right uptill her last film Akarshan releasing in 1988. Her popularity was so immense that movie producers would often line up at her door to sign her for their upcoming movie projects. Her career peaked at the time when most heroines were engulfed in Indian attribute and Babi was one among the few actresses whose attire was completely westernised and this provided her a certain latitude many other contemporary female artists were denied in India's heavily male-dominated and misogynistic cinematic fiefdom. Parveen Babi along with Zeenat Aman with their chiselled looks, well-sculpted bodies and anglicised accents, donned the mantle of the archetypal Indian heroine and imparted to the female prima donna of Bollywood their characteristic mannerisms forever . As Babi's personality symbolised western standards, it would be difficult for Bollywood producers to personify her role in Indian sentiments. Hence she was given roles which were glamorous and represented standards of a film star quality and established her status as a first female superstar of Bollywood or the commercially successful heroine and this paved the way to differ herself from the other contemporary actress in Bombay's film industry. She had appeared in most of the commercially successful films of that era and her famous co-stars include Amitabh Bachchan, Shashi Kapoor, Feroz Khan, Dharmendra, Rajesh Khanna, Vinod Khanna, Manoj Kumar and Rishi Kapoor who were all the leading stars of 1970s and 1980s. In her acting career, which spanned almost ten years, she has acted in more than fifty films, of which ten were considered to be best. These films were also blockbusters of those times. Parveen Babi replaced the image of saree clad, conventional Indian lead actresses with a glamorous woman look. She never shied away from portraying roles of women having a live-in relationship with men and consuming alcohol openly, both of which were a taboo in those times. She undeniably lit up and overpowered the screen with her presence. The fact that Parveen was paired with Amitabh Bachchan in 8 films during the peak of the Big B mania attests to her stature and star power. It seems to have taken that only a superstar of Bachchan's stature could stand side by side with the presence of Parveen Babi. Amitabh and Parveen complemented each other in the heady first years of the Angry Young Man phenomenon. She would often appear in popular film songs which have become the craze of the young generations and such song picturisations involved glamorous costumes and ravishing film sets and in time would become hugely popular and this include the ones like Jawaani Jaaneman, Raat Baaqi Baat Baaqi in Namak Halaal, Pyaar Karne Waale in Shaan and Mara Thumka in Kranti, and deliberately this popularity made her among the highest paid actresses in Bollywood at those times. She would appear in front page of every film magazine, whether the Filmfare, The Stardust, Bombay Dyeing or even the prestigious Time. On 30 July 1983, Parveen Babi left India and the film industry at the height of her career and travelled to various countries for a spiritual journey with U. G. Krishnamurti and her friend Valentine and spent most of the time in California, United States. On 7 April 1984, She was suspected at John F. Kennedy International Airport after she failed to submit her identification papers and as she behaved to be difficult, the authorities handcuffed her and kept her in a general ward with thirty other mentally disturbed patients. The Indian Consul General, who had been informed of the unfortunate incident, had personally come to visit her at the hospital. During U.G.'s visit, Parveen smiled and chatted with the Consul as though nothing had happened. When asked about how she felt about experiences of people and countries that she lived in, she replied, \"my experience of people is that human beings are very good people. However, the powerful, to serve their vested power interests manipulate pressure and use ordinary human beings and their power ploy and force them into negative act. However, I believe, eventually, the human spirit of positive will triumph and as far as other attributes of people are considered I find Americans to be extremely progressive and ingenious race. And I identify a great deal with Americans.\" She returned to Mumbai in November 1989 where she was unrecognizable as her former self after having put on a considerable amount of weight. She was rumoured to have been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, a mental illness although she regularly denied this, stating that her being labelled as such was a conspiracy by the film industry and the media to malign her image and make her appear as insane, so that they can cover up their crimes. Some sources[who?] indicate that it could have been a situation of acute depression, but not confirmed since she had many failed relationships with one of her former lovers openly humiliating her. This led Parveen to break relationships with most of her close dear ones including her own blood relations, having few contacts with known people and had become reclusive as she distrusted everyone. She accused many foreign dignitaries as well as Indian film personalities including Amitabh Bachchan, Bill Clinton, Robert Redford, Prince Charles, Al Gore, US government, British government, French government, BJP government, Roman Catholic Church, CIA, CBI, KGB, Mossad of conspiring to kill her but her petition in court was dismissed for lack of evidence and when she was asked to show her evidences by the press, it was some sort of scribblings on notepad In an Interview to a film magazine dated 1989, she said \"Amitabh Bachchan is a super international gangster. He is after my life. His goons kidnapped me and I was kept on an Island where they performed a surgery on me and planted one transmitter/chip/electronic bug right under my ear.\" There was a photograph of Babi showing a scar below her ears. During the early 1990s, whenever journalists or members of the press would come to her then Kalumal estate apartment in Juhu for an interview, she would often ask them to eat her food and drink her water, so that she might be assured her food is not poisoned and assume her makeup was contaminated, so that her skin should peel off and according to her, the International Mafia had cut off her electricity to harass her.[citation needed] Even before starting an interview, She would keep her dictaphone on, announcing the day, date, time and the name of journalists and publication into the microphone and would record before the conversation began.[citation needed] Many Journalists found her to be very intelligent, vivid, convivial person and one who spoke fluent English. She would later refer to them as \"agents of Amitabh Bachchan\". One of her neighbours said that when Bachchan's film was shown on cable television, the actress reacted violently and had to be calmed. Nevertheless, she started a career as an interior decorator in 1991. In 2002, she again hit the headlines when she filed an affidavit in the special court hearing the 1993 serial bomb blasts case, claiming that she had gathered clinching evidence against actor Sanjay Dutt showing his involvement in the case, but she did not turn up in court after being summoned saying that she was afraid of being killed. In the last four years of her life, Babi recorded every phone call, always punctiliously informing the caller about surveillance. She also had the habit of recording her daily thoughts and activities. Some of the collection of her notepads found in the office of the State Administrator General of the Government of Maharashtra gives her thought on hooks of suspicion and doubt and go on to repeat.[citation needed] What shines through is the meticulousness, say, in the planning of an event at her house. A few months before she died, Babi hosted a small Christmas dinner at her Juhu flat. The names of the seven guests are listed on the notepad, one of them is Reverend Avinash Rangayya (the pastor of All Saints Anglican Church, Church of North India at Malabar Hill). The French dishes on the menu are listed and next to them is a series of reminders: \"Call caterer for knives, forks, glasses, spoons.\" \"Get four bakery cakes.\" \"Clean plates, table cloths.\" \"Call florist.\" \"Clean and prepare salad ingredients.\" And finally: \"Asparagus\". She was said to have lived lonely and converted to Christianity during the late 1990s and also ate pork because she found not eating pork as racist. In an interview in 1998, she said, \"I was born a Muslim and later, I converted to Christianity. But I have never done things I didn't believe. Even when I was a Muslim, I didn't understand why it made me a more spiritual entity, if I did not eat pork. I always felt that the essence of spirituality lies in being a good human and following good, positive principles. The Golden Dragon Chinese restaurant at the Taj, those days, was quite famous for pork delicacies and every time I got a break from shooting, I would rush off to the Golden Dragon. Whenever my friends questioned me about my eating pork, I would say that it was more important for me to be a human being than a racist.\" However, she managed to maintain her posh penthouse apartment in Mumbai and lived affluently from sound financial investments. She was found dead on 22 January 2005 after her residential society secretary alerted the police that she had not collected milk and newspapers from her doorstep for three days. The police suspected that she may have been dead for up to 72 hours before her body was found. The cause of her death was not immediately known. She was found to have gangrene of the left foot as a complication of her diabetic condition. A wheelchair was found near her bed and a series of disarranged paintings, clothes, medicines and old newspapers. She had a bandage on her left foot, that she had put on, to treat her gangrene which had resulted from a long ailment of diabetes. It is possible that she was unable to walk in her last days due to a gangrenous foot and required the use of a wheelchair to move inside the house. A post mortem was conducted at Cooper Hospital and reports showed that there were no traces of food in her stomach but some alcohol (possibly from her medication) was found and it is possible that she had not consumed anything for more than three days and as a consequence starved to death. The police ruled out any foul play and it was determined she succumbed due to total organ failure and diabetes. Parveen Babi converted to Christianity during the last years of her life, as she stated in an interview, and was baptised in a Protestant Anglican Church at Malabar Hill. and expressed a desire to be buried as per Christian rites but her relatives who were Muslims claimed her body after her death and buried her as per Islamic rites. Hence Babi was buried next to her mother at Santacruz, Mumbai on 23 January 2005. After her death the State Administrator General of Maharashtra became sole custodian of her properties and assets, and took responsiblty for the management of them. After Parveen Babi\u2019s death chaos erupted when various distant relatives filed petitions with the high court regarding the will of her property which had been lying in the locker of a Junagadh bank, executed jointly by the late actor and her friend Murad Khan Babi, this will stated that 70 per cent of her property was to be put in a trust in her name to help poor members of the Babi family. Twenty per cent was pledged to Murad Khan Babi, for being \"a guiding force\", and 10 per cent was to be given to Christian missionary funds. Five years later, due to a shortage of land space for burials, Parveen Babi's grave along with other luminary Bollywood celebrities such as Mohammed Rafi, Madhubala, Sahir Ludhianvi, Talat Mahmood, Naushad Ali who were interred at Santa Cruz Muslim Cemetery were exhumed and their remains were disposed of (relocated) to provide space for new burials."

        "artist_name": "Pran_(actor)", 
        "biography": " Pran Krishan Sikand (12 February 1920\u00a0\u2013 12 July 2013), better known by his mononym, Pran, was an Indian actor, known as a movie villain and character actor in Hindi cinema from the 1940s to the 1990s. He acted as a hero in 1940\u201347, as a villain in 1942\u20131991, and played supporting and character roles in 1948\u20132007. In a long and prolific career Pran appeared in over 350 films. He played the leading man in work like Khandaan (1942), Pilpili Saheb (1954) and Halaku (1956). His roles in the films like Madhumati (1958), Jis Desh Men Ganga Behti Hai (1960), Upkar (1967), Shaheed (1965), Purab Aur Paschim (1970), Ram Aur Shyam(1967), Aansoo Ban Gaye Phool (1969), Johny Mera Naam (1970), Victoria No. 203 (1972), Be-Imaan (1972), Zanjeer (1973), Don (1978), Amar Akbar Anthony (1977) and Duniya (1984) are considered to be among his best performances. Pran has received many awards and honours in his career. He won the Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award in 1967, 1969 and 1972 and was awarded the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997. He was awarded as the 'Villain of the Millennium' by Stardust in 2000. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 2001 for his contributions to the arts. He was honoured in 2013 with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the highest national award for cinema artists, by the Government of India. In 2010, he was named on the list of CNN's Top 25 Asian actors of all time. Pran died on 12 July 2013 at the age of 93 of pneumonia after suffering from a prolonged illness in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.   Pran was born on 12 February 1920 in Ballimaran, Kotgarh Old Delhi, into a wealthy Punjabi family. His father, Kewal Krishan Sikand, was a civil engineer and a government civil contractor; his mother was Rameshwari. Pran was one of seven children: four sons and three daughters. Pran was academically gifted, especially in mathematics. His father had a transferable job, and so Pran studied in various places, including Dehradun, Kapurthala, Meerut and Unnao (Uttar Pradesh), finally completing his matriculation from Hamid School, in Rampur (U.P.). Thereafter, he joined A. Das & Co., Delhi as an apprentice as to become a professional photographer. He travelled to Shimla and played the role of Sita in a local staging of \"Ramlila\". Madan Puri enacted the role of Rama in this play. Pran got his first role in Dalsukh M. Pancholi's Punjabi film Yamla Jat (1940) because of an accidental meeting with writer Wali Mohammad Wali at a shop in Lahore. Directed by Moti B. Gidwani, the film featured Noor Jehan and Durga Khote. This was followed by small roles in the film Chaudhary and Khajanchi, both in 1941. Pancholi cast him again in Khandaan (1942), which was Pran's first Hindi film. It featured him as romantic hero, opposite Noor Jehan, who had acted with him in Yamla Jat as a child artist. In Khandaan, she was under 15 years old and compensated for the difference in their heights in close-up shots by standing on top of bricks. In the pre-partition era, director Gidwani cast Pran in more films like Kaise Kahoon (1945) and Khamosh Nigahen (1946). Pran had acted in 22 films from 1942 to 1946 in Lahore; 18 were released by 1947. Due to India's partition in 1947, his career had a brief break. His films from 1944 to 1947 were made in undivided India, but Taraash (1951) and Khanabadosh (1952) (both co-starring Manorama) were released only in Pakistan after Partition. He left Lahore and arrived in Bombay. For a few months, he looked for acting opportunities while doing other jobs. He worked in Delmar Hotel, Marine Drive for eight months, after which he got a chance to act in 1948. Because of help from writer Saadat Hasan Manto and actor Shyam, he got a role in the Bombay Talkies' film, Ziddi which starred Dev Anand and Kamini Kaushal in the lead and was directed by Shaheed Latif. The movie launched Pran's career in Bombay. Incidentally, it proved to be Dev Anand's big break as a hero. By 1950 he was gradually established as a premier villain in Hindi cinema. Within a week of Ziddi's success, he had signed three more films \u2014 S M Yusuf's Grihasti (1948), which became a diamond jubilee hit, Prabhat Films's Apradhi (1949) and Wali Mohammad's Putli (1949). By then, Wali Mohammad, who was responsible for Pran's first role, had come to Bombay and became a producer, setting up an office at Famous Studios, near Mahalaxmi Racecourse. In the 1940s, romantic duets featuring him, like the songs \"Tere Naaz Uthane Ko Jee Chahta Hai\" from Grihasti opposite Shardha and from Khandaan (1942) with Noor Jehan, became popular in the 1940s. The way he expressed his dialogues in films like Sheesh Mahal (1950), a series of disguises he made in Adalat (1958) and the rapport he shared with vamps like Kuldip Kaur in Jashan (1955) showcased his versatility in the 1950s. As a villain, Pran's initial successful films were Ziddi and Bari Behan (1949). Pran's trademark blowing of smoke rings first appeared in the latter film. He was regularly offered the role of the main villain or of negative character in films with Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand and Raj Kapoor as the lead hero in the 1950s and 60s. From the 1950s directors like M. V. Raman, Nanabhai Bhatt, Kalidas, Ravindra Dave, I. S. Johar, Bimal Roy repeatedly cast him. Similarly in the 1960s, he was frequent in the directorial ventures of A. Bhim Singh, Shakti Samanta, Bhappi Sonie, K. Amarnath, Nasir Hussain and others. In the 1970s, new younger directors and producers cast him in their films even though Pran asked for the highest price among supporting actors from 1968 to 1982. Pran's performance as the negative character was appreciated especially in Dilip Kumar starrers like Azaad (1955), Devdas (1955), Madhumati (1958), Dil Diya Dard Liya (1966), Ram Aur Shyam (1967) and Aadmi (1968) and films with Dev Anand as the lead man like Ziddi (1948), Munimji (1955), Amar Deep (1958), Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai (1961) and with Raj Kapoor in Aah (1953), Chori Chori (1956), Jagte Raho (1956), Chhalia (1960), Jis Desh Men Ganga Behti Hai (1960), Dil Hi Toh Hai (1963). Films with him as the lead hero, Pilpili Saheb (1954) and then Halaku in 1956, were big hits too. He had roles in several genres, like as a pirate in Sindbad the Sailor (1952) and Daughter of Sindbad (1958); in action-packed thrillers like Azad (1955); historicals such as Aan (1952) and Raj Tilak (1958); social themes such as Baradari (1955); and light romances like Munimji (1955) and Asha (1957). In the 1960s and early 1970s, despite being in his 40s, he continues to play pivotal roles as a character of the age range of 25 to 30 in films with Shammi Kapoor, Joy Mukherjee, Rajendra Kumar and Dharmendra as the lead heroes. From the early 1950s to the early 1970s, Pran gained particular notoriety due to his frequent roles as a villain. From 1964, with Pooja Ke Phool and Kashmir Ki Kali, he also brought a comical side to his negative characters. While Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor's careers as the young hero started to decline from the late 1960s and Rajendra Kumar and Shammi Kapoor stopped playing the lead by 1973, Pran continued with his roles. His association with Dev Anand, begun in 1948, continued even during the 1970s and the 1980s with Johny Mera Naam (1970), Yeh Gulistan Hamara (1972), Joshila (1973), Warrant (1975) and Des Pardes (1978). Pran played roles in comedy films starring Kishore Kumar and Mehmood Ali in the lead. His collaborations with Mehmood includes Sadhu Aur Shaitaan (1968), Lakhon Me Ek (1971) and with Kishore Kumar include Chham Chhama Chham (1952), Aasha, Bewaqoof (1960), Half Ticket (1962) and Man-Mauji (1962). In the late 1960s, Pran played Malang Chacha, a veteran war hero, in Manoj Kumar's film Upkar (1967). The Kalyanji Anandji song \"Kasme Waade Pyaar Wafaa\" was picturised on him. In this film, Pran played a more sympathetic role. He received his first Filmfare Award for Upkar. Kumar continued to cast him in pivotal roles in films such as Purab Aur Paschim (1970), Be-Imaan (1972), Sanyasi (1975) and Dus Numbri (1976). From 1967 onwards he also acted in Bengali films, beginning with Ashim Banerjee's Sonai Dighe, where Joy Mukherjee was the hero. Pran played the supporting role in several of these, which replaced his image as the villain with that of a character actor. After 1969, he was offered the lead role in films like Nanha Farishta (1969), Jangal Mein Mangal (1972), Dharma (1973), Ek Kunwari Ek Kunwara (1973) and Rahu Ketu (1978). Pran and Ashok Kumar were very close friends in professional and real life. They acted in 27 films together in 1951\u20131987 starting with Afsana (1951). Their other films include Mr. X (1957), Adhikar (1971), Victoria No. 203 (1972), Chori Mera Kaam (1975) and Raja Aur Rana (1984). Sung by Kishore Kumar, the songs \"Hum Bolega To Bologe Ke Bolta Hai\" from Kasauti (1974), \"Micheal Daru Pita Hai\" from Majboor (1974), picturised on Pran, were very popular.[citation needed] During 1969\u20131982, Pran was one of the highest paid actors of Bollywood. He played the lead role in the film Aurat (1967) paired opposite Padmini, with Rajesh Khanna in a supporting role. Pran and Khanna worked in five more films \u2014 Maryada (1971), Jaanwar (1983), Souten (1983), Bewafai (1985) and Durgaa (1985). In 1973, he recommended Amitabh Bachchan to Prakash Mehra for the character of Vijay in Zanjeer, a role earlier offered to Dev Anand and Dharmendra. Pran's role as Sher Khan, with his red wig and beard and Pathani style was well appreciated. Pran acted with Bachchan in about 14 films with notable ones being Zanjeer, Don (1978), Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), Dostana (1980), Naseeb (1981) and Sharaabi (1984). Pran occasionally accepted antagonistic roles from 1971 to 1992. He appeared as a villain in films like Maryada, Naya Zamana, Jawan Muhabat, Aan Baan, Roop Tera Mastana, Yeh Gulistan Hamara, Gaddar, Rahu Ketu, Andha Kanoon (1983), Duniya (1984), Insaaf Kaun Karega, Durgaa, Bewafai, Hoshiyar, Dharm Adhikari and Azaad Desh Ke Ghulam. Pran had dual roles in Khoon Ka Rishta, Insaaf and Jangal Mein Mangal. He produced the movie Lakshmanrekha in 1991, the only one he produced in his Bollywood career, and played the role of Kishan Lal Sharma in movie. At the age of 78, Pran suffered a heart attack in 1998, after which he started rejecting film offers due to age-related problems. But in the 1990s, Amitabh Bachchan requested Pran to do roles in his home productions Tere Mere Sapne (1996) and Mrityudata (1997). Pran made an exception by acting in them to help Bachchan through a difficult time in his career. In 1997, his character in Mrityudaata was modified to compensate for Pran's shaking legs in real life and in Tere Mere Sapne, his shots were taken with him seated. After 2000, he made few guest appearances. Pran had a six-decade career in Hindi cinema and is one of the most celebrated actors of the industry. His acting is said to have been effective enough to desist people naming their children 'Pran' because of his negative roles, while the industry had started calling him 'Pran Sahab'. His favourite line \"Barkhurdaar\" became immensely popular. His biography, \"...and Pran\", was a tribute to the about 250 of his 350 movies that his name at the end of the credits, with the words \"...and Pran\" and sometimes \"...above all, Pran\". In 2012, he gave his hand print for \"Legend's Walk\", a waterfront promenade in Bandra. Pran married Shukla Ahluwalia in 1945 and has two sons, Arvind and Sunil Sikand, and a daughter, Pinky. He could not attend the 60th National Film Awards in May 2013 where he was to be presented the Dadasaheb Phalke Award. Instead, Information and Broadcasting minister Manish Tewari presented the award at Pran's home in Mumbai. He was treated at the Lilavati Hospital and died on 12 July 2013, at 8:30\u00a0p.m. He had been admitted to hospital a few times in the last few months for deteriorating health; at some point he was battling pneumonia. Pran's death was widely noted by statesmen and his fellow entertainers. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh paid his condolences on his death and called him \"an icon\". Veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan tweeted his feelings about his death calling him a \"magnificent pillar\" of the film industry. Pran has been honoured with awards for his portrayal of negative and characters. He has received three Filmfare Awards in the Best Supporting Actor category for Upkar, Aansoo Ban Gaye Phool and Be-Imaan. However, in 1973 when he was awarded for his role of constable Ram Singh in Be-Imaan, he refused to accept the award stating that the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director should have gone to Ghulam Mohammed for Pakeezah and not to the musical duo Shankar Jaikishan for Be-imaan. He was awarded with three Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards for his supporting roles. For his vast contributions to Indian cinema, Pran has been honoured Lifetime Achievement awards, including those of Filmfare, Star Screen Awards and Zee Cine Awards. In 2001, the Government of India conferred the Padma Bhushan on him. In April 2013, he was announced to be the winner of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the most prestigious award of the Indian cinema, presented by the Government of India. The award was presented to him at the 60th National Film Awards for his lifetime of work in the film industry. Celebrities congratulated him on this occasion with Amitabh Bachchan calling him \"a large pillar of the Indian Film Industry\" on his Twitter feed. He was a contender of the award for the previous year with Manoj Kumar and Vyjayanthimala, but Soumitra Chatterjee was chosen as the awardee. Source: Official website.

        "artist_name": "Preity_Zinta", 
        "biography": " Preity Zinta (pronounced [\u02c8pri\u02d0t\u032ai \u02c8z\u026a\u0273\u0288a\u02d0]; born 31 January 1975) is an Indian film actress. She has appeared in Hindi films of Bollywood, as well as Telugu, Punjabi and English language films. After graduating with degrees in English honours and criminal psychology, Zinta made her acting debut in Dil Se.. in 1998 followed by a role in Soldier the same year. These performances earned her a Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut, and she was later recognised for her role as a teenage single mother in Kya Kehna (2000). She subsequently established a career with a variety of character types; her film roles along with her screen persona have been credited with contributing to a change in the concept of a Hindi film heroine, and won her several accolades. Zinta received the Filmfare Award for Best Actress in 2003 for her performance in the romantic drama Kal Ho Naa Ho. She went on to play the lead female role in two consecutive annual top-grossing films in India, the science fiction film Koi... Mil Gaya (2003), which is her biggest commercial success, and the star-crossed romance Veer-Zaara (2004), which earned her critical acclaim. She was later noted for her portrayal of independent, modern Indian women in Salaam Namaste (2005) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), top-grossing productions in overseas markets. These accomplishments have established her as a leading actress of Hindi cinema. Her first international film role was in the Canadian film Heaven on Earth, for which she was awarded the Silver Hugo Award for Best Actress at the 2008 Chicago International Film Festival. In addition to acting in films, Zinta has written a series of columns for BBC News Online South Asia, is a social activist, a television presenter, and a regular stage performer. She is the founder of the production company PZNZ Media and, along with ex-boyfriend Ness Wadia, a co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kings XI Punjab. She is known in the Indian media for publicly speaking her mind and openly expressing her opinions, and consequently has sparked the occasional controversy. These controversies include her being the only witness not to retract in court her earlier statements against the Indian mafia during the 2003 Bharat Shah case, for which she was awarded the Godfrey Phillips National Bravery Award.   Zinta was born into a family from Rohru in Shimla district, Himachal Pradesh. Her father, Durganand Zinta, was an officer in the Indian Army. He died in a car accident when she was 13\u00a0years old; the accident also involved her mother, Nilprabha, who was severely injured and consequently remained bedridden for two years. Zinta called the tragic accident and her father's death a significant turning point in her life, which forced her to mature rapidly. She has two brothers; Deepankar and Manish, a year older and a year younger respectively. Deepankar is a commissioned officer in the Indian Army, while Manish lives in California. Zinta, who describes herself as a tomboy as a child, has emphasised her father's military background as having a lasting impression on how family life was conducted. He asserted the importance of discipline and punctuality to the children. She studied at the Convent of Jesus and Mary boarding school in Shimla. Although she confesses to loneliness in the boarding school, she noted that it was compensated by her finding a \"...\u00a0perfect set of friends\" there. As a student, she developed a love for literature, particularly the works of William Shakespeare and poetry. According to Zinta, she enjoyed schoolwork and received good grades; in her free time she played sports, especially basketball. Upon graduating from the boarding school in Sanawar (The Lawrence School) at age 18, Zinta enrolled at St. Bede's College in Shimla. She graduated college with an English honours degree, and then started a graduate programme in psychology. She earned a postgraduate degree in criminal psychology, but later took up modelling. Zinta's first television commercial was for Perk chocolates, the result of a chance meeting with a director at a friend's birthday party in 1996. The director persuaded Zinta to audition for the spot, and she was selected. Afterwards, she appeared in other catalogues and commercials, including one for the soap Liril. In 1997, Zinta met Shekhar Kapur when she accompanied a friend to an audition, and was asked if she would audition too. Upon seeing her audition, Kapur insisted that she become an actress. She was originally scheduled to make her screen debut in Kapur's Tara Rum Pum Pum opposite Hrithik Roshan, but the filming was cancelled. Kapur later recommended her for director Mani Ratnam's Dil Se... Zinta often recalls that when she joined the film industry, her friends teased her that she would typically \"wear white saris and dance in the rain\", thereby motivating her to play different parts. Zinta commenced shooting for Kundan Shah's Kya Kehna, whose release was delayed until 2000. The delay of another film, Soldier, meant that her first release was Dil Se.. (1998) opposite Shahrukh Khan and Manisha Koirala. She was introduced as Preeti Nair, a middle-class Delhi girl and Khan's fianc\u00e9e. The film was considered an unusual launch for a newcomer, as her role called for only 20\u00a0minutes of screen time. However, she was eventually noticed for her role, particularly for the forthright character she played. Her scene with Khan, in which she asked him, \"Are you a virgin?\", became well-known, and her portrayal earned her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. She played her first leading role in the action-drama Soldier (1998), a commercial hit of the year. She won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for her performance in both Dil Se.. and Soldier. Zinta next acted in two Telugu films, Premante Idera (1998), opposite Venkatesh; and Raja Kumarudu (1999), opposite Mahesh Babu. She followed with the leading role alongside Akshay Kumar in Sangharsh, a thriller directed by Tanuja Chandra and written by Mahesh Bhatt. Zinta portrayed the character of Reet Oberoi, a CBI officer who falls in love with a captured killer played by Kumar. Having been impressed with Zinta's work in Dil Se, Chandra approached her for the part after several leading actresses had refused the offer, which Zinta viewed as an opportunity to expand her range. Sangharsh was not a box-office success, although Zinta's performance received favourable comments by critics. An article published by The Tribune upon the film's release described her performance as \"an amazing act\" in an \"intense film\", documenting her career path thus far with the observation, \"She wowed the audiences with her cameo in Dil Se, then she zapped the viewers with her sensuality in Soldier and now Preity Zinta is all set to shock everybody with her stark performance [in Sangharsh].\" Zinta's first role in 2000 was in the drama Kya Kehna, which unexpectedly became a box-office success. The film addressed themes of single parenthood and teenage pregnancy, and gained Zinta wider recognition from the public as well as film critics. Her portrayal of Priya Bakshi, a teenage single mother who fights social prejudice, earned her several award nominations, including her first nomination for Best Actress at the Filmfare Awards. Anupama Chopra from India Today reported that Zinta belonged to a new breed of Hindi film actors that breaks away from character stereotypes. Later that year, Zinta starred in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's drama Mission Kashmir alongside Sanjay Dutt and Hrithik Roshan. Set in the valley of Kashmir during the Indo-Pakistani conflicts, the film dealt with the topic of terrorism and crime. Zinta's role was that of Sufiya Parvez, a TV reporter and Roshan's childhood love. A review in The Hindu said about her performance, \"Preity Zinta is her usual cherubic self and lends colour to the otherwise serious proceedings\". It was an economic success, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of the year in India. In 2001, Zinta earned positive reviews for her role in Farhan Akhtar's National Film Award-winning Dil Chahta Hai. Depicting the contemporary routine life of Indian affluent youth, it is set in modern-day urban Mumbai and focuses on a major period of transition in the lives of three young friends (Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna). Zinta starred as Aamir Khan's love interest, Shalini. Dil Chahta Hai was popular with critics, some of whom noted it broke new ground by introducing a realistic portrayal of Indian youth. The film was a moderate box-office success in India; it performed well in the big cities but failed in the rural areas, which was attributed by critics to the urban-oriented lifestyle it presented. Rediff.com wrote of Zinta that she \"...\u00a0is beautiful and vibrant, wavering between endearingly naive and confused\". Three more 2001 releases featured Zinta, including Abbas-Mustan's romantic drama Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, which was released after a one-year delay due to the trial of producer Bharat Shah. This film was one of the first Bollywood films to address the controversial issue of surrogate childbirth. Zinta played the role of Madhubala, a golden-hearted prostitute hired as a surrogate mother. Initially reluctant to play the part, she eventually accepted it at the directors' persuasion and, to prepare for it, visited several bars and nightclubs at Mumbai's red-light areas to study the lingo and mannerisms of sex-workers. She received a second Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards for her performance, of which reviewer Sukanya Verma wrote, \"Preity Zinta, who clearly has the meatiest part of all, makes the best of it. Her transformation from the cocky and unabashed prostitute to a sensitive and warm person is amazingly believable.\" In 2002, Zinta collaborated once again with director Kundan Shah, as the protagonist in the family drama Dil Hai Tumhaara, alongside Rekha, Mahima Chaudhry and Arjun Rampal. She played Shalu, an adopted daughter craving love, a role she identified with due to its rebellious nature. Billed as a star vehicle for Zinta, Dil Hai Tumhaara did not succeed financially, but her portrayal was uniformly acclaimed by critics, with those critical of the film marking her presence as its main highlight. Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama noted, \"...\u00a0Preity Zinta, in an author-backed role\u00a0...\u00a0steals the show with a sterling performance. Her scenes with Rekha (second half) and Alok Nath (pre-climax) are simply outstanding. Here's a performance that is sure to win accolades from the junta and critics whole-heartedly.\" Zinta was the female lead in India's three highest-grossing films of 2003: The Hero: Love Story of a Spy, Koi... Mil Gaya and Kal Ho Naa Ho. The Hero, co-starring Sunny Deol and Priyanka Chopra, is a patriotic drama about a spy network involving terrorists and an Indian army officer. Zinta played the part of Reshma, a villager who falls in love with the officer and becomes part of this network. The film, involving stunts never seen before in the cinematic history of Bollywood, became the most expensive Hindi film ever produced at the time. Despite being the third highest-grossing film of that year, it failed to recover its production costs at the box office. She next starred in Honey Irani's directorial debut, Armaan, alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Anil Kapoor. This drama is set in a hospital and follows the travails of its personnel and its principal, Dr. Akash, who struggles arduously to sustain the institution financially. Zinta played Akash's schizophrenic wife Sonia Kapoor, a role written specially for her and which she liked because it let her \"give vent to all [her] frustrations\". The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Zinta was particularly praised. Khalid Mohamed called her a \"peppy scene-stealer, achieving her manic mood swings dexterously.\" For her performance, she received nominations for Best Performance in a Negative Role at different award ceremonies, including Filmfare. Rakesh Roshan's science-fiction film Koi... Mil Gaya, about a developmentally disabled young man (played by Hrithik Roshan) coming in contact with an alien, followed. Zinta played the role of Nisha, a young woman whom Roshan befriends and later falls in love with. She received another Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare for the role. The film was a financial and critical success and became the most popular film of the year, as well as Zinta's highest-grossing film, with a domestic total of \u20b9680 million (US$11\u00a0million). It won the Filmfare Award for Best Movie, among others, and went on to spawn two superhero films as sequels\u2014Krrish and Krrish 3\u2014making it the first of the Krrish film series, beyond which Zinta did not proceed. Zinta's final release of 2003 was Kal Ho Naa Ho, a tear-jerking romantic drama set in New York City. It was directed by Nikhil Advani and written by Karan Johar, co-starring Jaya Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan and Saif Ali Khan. The film was received favourably by critics and became India's second-biggest hit of the year after Koi... Mil Gaya. It also did well internationally and became India's top-grossing film of the year overseas, earning over \u20b9750 million (US$12\u00a0million) worldwide. Zinta played the role of Naina Catherine Kapur, an insecure and angry young Indian-American woman who falls in love with a man who has a fatal heart disease. She won several awards for her performance, including the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Writing for Stardust, critic Ram Kamal Mukherjee asserted that the movie rested \"wholly and solely\" on Zinta's \"astounding performance\", further noting her for having \"skillfully handled the hues of the complex character.\" Derek Elley of Variety wrote, \"Zinta, who's been carving a growing following the past three years or so, has never been better, definitively moving from juve roles to a charismatic young woman with her sexy, assured Naina.\" In 2004 she starred as TV journalist Romila Dutta in Farhan Akhtar's war drama Lakshya, alongside Hrithik Roshan. The film was based on the historical events of the 1999 Kargil War; Zinta's character was modelled after TV journalist Barkha Dutt, the only female reporter who covered the conflict. The film was a critical success, yet her performance received mixed reviews; Namarata Joshi of Outlook likened her to \"a teenybopper trying to do a TV newsreading skit for her college fest\" and Rediff.com concluded, \"Zinta has quite a good role and a good deal of footage in the film, and she does a fairly decent job of it without ever being spectacular.\" Later that year, Yash Chopra cast her opposite Shahrukh Khan as the female lead in the love saga Veer-Zaara, the top-grossing Hindi film of that year both in India and abroad, with revenues of over \u20b9940 million (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide. The film, which relates the love story of an Indian officer, Veer Pratap Singh, and a Pakistani woman, Zaara Haayat Khan, had a strong international release, including a screening at the Berlin Film Festival, and won several Best Movie awards at major Indian award functions. For her portrayal of Zaara, a role which required her to master the fine nuances of Urdu language, Zinta received her fourth Filmfare Best Actress nomination. Variety hailed her as \"the most interesting young actress of her generation,\" writing that she \"is her usual lively self as the\u00a0willful Zaara.\" Veer-Zaara was Zinta's second highest-grossing film and third major success in two consecutive years. It marked the beginning of her work with Yash Raj Films, one of the largest production houses in Bollywood. In 2005, Zinta appeared in two films. Her first release was the folk comedy Khullam Khulla Pyaar Karen, co-starring Govinda, a production that had been delayed since 2002. The film garnered negative reviews and poor box office returns. Zinta's role was small, and was not well received. She next starred opposite Saif Ali Khan in Siddharth Anand's comedy-drama Salaam Namaste. Produced by Yash Raj Films, it was the first Indian feature to be filmed entirely in Australia and went on to become the year's highest-grossing Bollywood production outside of India, earning \u20b9570 million (US$8.8\u00a0million) internationally. The film tells the story of a contemporary cohabiting Indian couple and their subsequent struggle with an unexpected pregnancy. Zinta played the female protagonist Ambar Malhotra, a single modern young woman who leaves India to make her own life in Melbourne. Salaam Namaste received mostly positive reviews, and Zinta's performance earned her nominations for Best Actress at a number of award ceremonies. Taran Adarsh referred to her as \"terrific\" and argued that she gave \"her most accomplished performance to date\". The New York Times noted, \"She is cheerleader-homecoming queen-fraternity sweetheart pretty, so even when her characters are being unkind it's hard not to like her.\" Zinta received further success in 2006, starring in Karan Johar's drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna with an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji and Kirron Kher. The film became one of the biggest box-office hits in India, earning \u20b9635 million (US$9.8\u00a0million), and grossed over \u20b9496 million (US$7.7\u00a0million) abroad, the biggest Bollywood success of all-time in the overseas market up until then. It was her fourth overseas top-earner in four consecutive years. The film tells the story of two unhappily married couples in New York, and an ensuing extramarital affair. Zinta played the role of Rhea Saran, an ambitious fashion magazine editor. She described the role as an attempt to shed her vivacious public image. The Indian Express concurred that this was successful: \"The lady has not just looked glamorous but she has walked with poise, sat with grace, smiled with composure and spoken with calmness. Who would have thought that the bubbly girl could so skilfully shed her age-old tag and walk away as the don't-mess-with-me lass. So all those who are in search of the peppy Preity, well guys you've dialed the wrong number this time.\" Zinta's next release of 2006 was Shirish Kunder's romantic musical Jaan-E-Mann, a story set in the United States about two men, played by Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar, who love the same woman. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics and its eventual box-office profit was poor. Zinta played the role of Piya, the cynosure of two men. She was mostly criticised for taking a role of minimal importance, though her performance was generally well received. Raja Sen labelled her role an \"ornament throughout,\" but further stated that she \"comes vividly alive in the film's last scene, a moment that makes you lament why filmmakers today don't let the babyfaced actress have more fun instead of forcing her to sob copiously. She doesn't have much to do in Jaan-E-Mann, but looks appropriately attractive.\" Zinta said that the film was a great relief after the more emotionally intense Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, as Jaan-E-Mann was \"easy, happy and much more simple\". In 2007, Zinta portrayed a British Pakistani woman, Alvira Khan, in her third project with Yash Raj Films, Shaad Ali's comedy Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, alongside Abhishek Bachchan, Bobby Deol and Lara Dutta. The film was a critical and commercial failure in India, and several critics panned her performance; The Times of India described her as \"too plastic\" and Rediff.com concluded, \"From accent to emotion, Preity is plain and simple insufferable in this film.\" Following the failure of two of her commercial releases, Zinta began working with art film directors, and turned towards neo-realistic films, known in India as parallel cinema. She acted in her first English film, Rituparno Ghosh's The Last Lear, as a struggling film actress opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, and was received well. Later reviews in India were approving, with Rajeev Masand writing, \"Preity Zinta gets through her scenes competently, never allowing her cute-as-a-button image to take away from the impact she makes here as a conflicted, mature woman.\" Initially dismissive of art films, Zinta eventually spoke of her first venture into the genre, confessing, \"I did think with art films that they don't pay you, they don't feed you, but I was wrong, and I'm so happy to be here.\" Zinta next starred in Samir Karnik's Heroes (2008), a road movie about two final-year film students who, as a part of their assignment, travel a thousand miles across North India to deliver three un-posted letters written by army personnel who lost their lives during the 1999 Kargil war to their families. The story unfolds the journey of these students in three chapters and follows how they meet and are inspired by the families of the soldiers. Zinta is featured in the first chapter as Salman Khan's war widow, Kuljeet Kaur, a woman who becomes the sole breadwinner of the family and single-handedly raises her son. In preparation for the role, Zinta attended Anupam Kher's acting school, \"Actor Prepares\", to learn the dialect and mannerisms of a Punjabi woman. The film was released to a mixed critical reaction, but her performance received rave reviews; Anand Singh of Hindustan Times wrote, \"Karnik is merely interested in wringing tears the old-fashioned way, and not in starting a debate. He succeeds\u2014mainly because Preity Zinta brings to a role a gravitas and dignity that is seen on the faces of ordinary women\u2014this may be her coming of age as an actress.\" By April 2008, Zinta had completed shooting for Jahnu Barua's drama Har Pal. In the same year she played the leading role of Chand in Deepa Mehta's Canadian film Heaven on Earth, a Punjabi language mystical drama based on the true story of a young Indian woman who, post an arranged marriage to a non-resident Indian man from Canada, migrates to Toronto and becomes a victim of severe domestic abuse. Expressing her desire for \"a new kind of acting challenge\", Zinta described Mehta as one director she was longing to work with in order to fulfill it. To prepare for the part, she read and watched several books and documentaries on domestic violence. As the film was to be shot entirely in Punjabi, a language that was totally alien to her, she learnt it in a crash course of fifty days. She was emotional during the making of the film: \"I never knew a character would affect me so deeply. I've become completely withdrawn and introspective... I can't snap out of the character.\" She eventually called it her most challenging project, as it helped her \"shed everything that Preity Zinta was about.\" Heaven on Earth was first screened at several film festivals and, upon release, garnered career-best reviews for Zinta. Her performance earned her the Silver Hugo Award for Best Actress at the 2008 Chicago International Film Festival, for \"her strong yet subtle performance as a woman struggling to keep her dreams despite brutal realities.\" Among other awards, she was acknowledged with Best Actress nominations at several award functions in Canada, including the Genie Award by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, and the Vancouver Film Critics Circle. Following Heaven on Earth, Zinta took a two-year sabbatical from films, later explaining that she had chosen to focus on her work with her cricket team. In 2011 she launched her own production company, PZNZ Media. Two years later and following numerous delays, she starred in her first film under the banner\u2014the Prem Raj-directed romantic comedy Ishkq in Paris, which she also co-wrote. An Indo-French collaboration, the film saw Zinta as a half-Indian half-French Parisian woman alongside Rhehan Malliek and Isabelle Adjani. Zinta's role required her to learn French and follow a strict diet and fitness regime, for which she hired the services of celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson. Whilst the film bombed at the box office and received mostly negative reviews, Zinta's performance attracted a mixed critical reception. Sonia Chopra of Sify called her \"hugely likeable\", and added that she is a \"good actress, astute producer and ... writer.\" Shilpa Jamkhandikar from Deccan Herald, critical of both the film and Zinta's work, concluded a scathing review by calling it \"a mediocre film, one that was supposed to showcase one of our favourite leading ladies, but instead just shows us what a shadow of her past she\u2019s become.\" As of December 2015, Zinta is currently filming for Neeraj Pathak's action comedy Bhaiyyaji Superhitt. She will be seen opposite Sunny Deol in the role of an aggressive Varanasi-based wife. In 2004, Zinta joined a group of South Asian commentators for BBC News Online. She expressed joy at participating in the project, saying, \"I am pretty outspoken and have my own view on every subject. So it will be a good platform for me to air my views.\" Her first column, \"The changing face of Bollywood\", published in January 2004, discussed the evolution of Bollywood in the past decade. The column became one of the site's ten most read stories of the day. In her second column, \"Odds stacked against Indian women\", Zinta analysed the eve teasing phenomenon in India, and criticised those who practice it. She wrote, \"Incidences like these take away a woman's dignity, her space and her freedom\u00a0...\u00a0why the state is so helpless in protecting the women. Why should women feel unsafe in a country which had an internationally revered woman prime minister?\" The column caught the attention of readers worldwide, and she received thousands of e-mails about it. It was applauded particularly by women for its stand against abuse of Indian women. Her third column, \"The darkness that all actors fear\", was a more personal column and dealt with her stardom, fans, insecurity and fears as an actor. Her fourth and final column, titled \"Facing death in Sri Lanka and Thailand\", described her two near-death experiences in late 2004. Zinta has taken part in several stage shows and world tours since 2001. Her first world tour, a series of concerts called Craze 2001, was performed across the U.S. alongside Anil Kapoor, Aamir Khan, Aishwarya Rai and Gracy Singh. The show faced early cancellation due to the 11 September 2001 attacks, and the team prepared to return to India as soon as possible. However, the shows continued successfully in Canada. In 2002, she participated in the show From India With Love in the UK, along with Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai. It took place at two outdoor venues, Manchester's Old Trafford and London's Hyde Park, with over 100,000\u00a0spectators. Zinta's largest world tour was in 2004, when she joined a group of stars (Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukerji, Saif Ali Khan, Arjun Rampal and Priyanka Chopra) in the Temptation 2004 tour. Showcased in over 22\u00a0countries across the world, it became Bollywood's most prominent international concert. In 2006, Zinta was part of the Heat 2006 world tour, along with Akshay Kumar, Saif Ali Khan, Sushmita Sen and Celina Jaitley. The Unforgettable Tour (2008) saw Zinta performing with the Bachchan family and Ritesh Deshmukh in a 40-day show staged in 11 cities across North America, Europe and the Caribbean. In December 2012, Zinta returned to the stage with the Temptation Reloaded concert in Jakarta (joined by Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukerji and Bipasha Basu). In 2011, Zinta made her television debut as the host of the show Guinness World Records \u2013 Ab India Todega on Colors Channel. An Indian version of Guinness Book of World Records, the show premiered on 18 March to an audience measurement of 3.3 rating points, which made it occupy the 7th position on the chart of celebrity-driven reality shows on Hindi entertainment channels. In a four-star review for Hindustan Times, critic Rachana Dubey wrote, \"Preity is a riot. She\u2019s vivacious and knows exactly when she needs to be serious and when she can crack jokes.\" Later that year, Zinta started hosting the celebrity-based chat show Up Close & Personal with PZ, shot at her own penthouse in Mumbai and broadcast on the newly launched channel UTV Stars. The first episode aired on 3 September. In 2015, Zinta featured as a talent judge for the seventh season of the dance reality show Nach Baliye. During her years in the film industry, Zinta has been involved with different charitable organisations and has particularly supported women's causes in India, for instance protesting against female infanticide. She has also participated in AIDS awareness drives and campaigns to clean up Mumbai. In 2005, along with other Bollywood stars, Zinta performed at the HELP! Telethon Concert raising money for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The following year, as an ambassador of the Godfrey Phillips National Bravery Movement, Zinta attended a blood donation camp organised by the Rotary Club of Delhi and the Godfrey Phillips Awards. She lent her support to the cause of women's empowerment and promoted blood donation. She said, \"Donating blood doesn't kill one but goes on to save somebody's life\u00a0.... Once blood is donated it becomes universal and might be used by anyone in need, irrespective of community, caste or region. It binds people together.\" In 2007, Zinta visited Hisar, Haryana, where she spent a day at the army training base to boost the morale of the jawan troops. The visit was conducted for an NDTV show, Jai Jawan, on which entertainers and actors visit Indian troops. While there, she also met children with disabilities at a special school maintained by the army. In August, along with Mumbai-based artist Gurcharan Singh, Zinta painted for the cause of street children for the non-governmental organisation Khushi. In December, she joined the efforts of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to curb human trafficking in India. She spoke on behalf of awareness against the practice, the need for protection and rehabilitation for those rescued from it, and punishment for perpetrators. In 2009, on her 34th birthday, Zinta adopted 34 girls from the Mother Miracle orphanage in Rishikesh and took the responsibility of financially supporting their education, food and clothing. She expressed her excitement at doing so: \"I've adopted 34 girls. I'll be looking after their entire upbringing from education to food, clothes etc. You've no idea how wonderful it feels to hear the excited chatter of all these girls together.\" In January 2010, Zinta was appointed the brand ambassador of The Loomba Trust, an organisation that works for the welfare of widows and their children. She said, having lost her father at 13, she could relate to the problems faced by widowed women. Later in the year, she joined the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) as their Goodwill Ambassador in India, to promote public awareness on HIV prevention, treatment and support, with emphasis on women and children, and combat discrimination against it. Speaking of her appointment, Zinta expressed hope to be \"the voice for the voiceless\" and bring about a \"transformation in the minds of people\" through collaborative work. In October 2010, Zinta was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from the University of East London. It was awarded in honour of both her cultural contribution and her humanitarian work, with the citation describing her as \"an international actress, pioneering star of Hindi cinema and devoted humanitarian. Preity has carved a path for women to follow.\" Along with Ness Wadia, Mohit Burman and others, Zinta acquired ownership rights in 2008 for the Mohali-based Twenty20 cricket team of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The group paid $76\u00a0million to acquire the franchise, and had since named the team Kings XI Punjab. Until 2009, Zinta was the only woman to own an IPL team, and was the league's youngest owner. She has been involved with launching ticket sales and promoting the team. She said, \"My involvement with the team is total. I am extremely passionate about our team and I do believe that I am the team's good luck factor, so I want to be there for everything.\" Zinta used to visit her native town Shimla when she was not busy shooting. In 2006, she moved into her own home in Mumbai. She does not identify with any particular religion. In an interview with The Times of India, she comments, \"I believe in good deeds, in karma, I don't believe in going to temples. For me, religion is very personal. It's all about having faith\u00a0... We have heard and read that all religions are equal. Now I am increasingly believing in this.\" She narrowly escaped death twice in late 2004: first after an explosion at a Temptation concert in Colombo, Sri Lanka; and second during the Indian Ocean earthquake. Zinta has been the subject of several controversies. In 2003, as a witness in the Bharat Shah case, she testified against the Indian mafia. Bharat Shah, the financer of one of her films, Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, was arrested in 2000 for having connections with Chhota Shakeel, a Mumbai underworld boss. Unlike several of her colleagues, Zinta repeated in court her earlier statement that she had received extortion threats from the mafia during the shooting of the film. After her testimony, she was given witness protection and was forced to stay out of the public eye for two months. Thirteen other witnesses before her, including celebrities Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan, were witnesses in the case but later retracted their earlier statements. Zinta was the only witness who did not become hostile to the prosecution; the nation responded positively to her actions. Consequently, she was the first recipient of Godfrey's Mind of Steel Award at the annual Red and White Bravery Awards, given to her for the \"courageous act\" of standing against the Mumbai Underworld. On receiving the award, she said, \"To be brave is not to be fearless. It is when you fear and you get over it, then you can be called brave. I am human. It is not that I fear nothing. But getting over a fear is a continuous process and I have been successful so far.\" Since 2006, Zinta has been the brand ambassador for the Godfrey Phillips Bravery awards. Tabloids have often linked Zinta romantically with other Bollywood stars, but she has strongly denied any such rumours. In 2000, Zinta began dating model Marc Robinson. They separated the following year, and according to Zinta remained on good terms. Asked in Filmfare about their break-up, she spoke of \"Very, very fond memories of the times we were together and I'd like to keep it to that\". Zinta dated the Bombay Dyeing heir, businessman Ness Wadia from February 2005 until May 2009. Their relationship was often reported on by the media, with frequent speculation about an engagement or a break-up. On June 13, 2014, Zinta filed a complaint to the Mumbai police against Ness Wadia alleging he had molested, threatened and abused her at an IPL match at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on 30 May. Wadia has denied the allegations. On 29 February 2016, Zinta married her long-time American partner Gene Goodenough at a private ceremony in Los Angeles. Goodenough is Senior Vice President for Finance at NLine Energy, a US-based hydroelectric power company. Zinta is particularly known in the Indian media for her straightforward nature and for honestly expressing her forthright opinions in public, be it about her on-screen or off-screen life or raising a voice against social injustice. While she does not believe she is \"as tough as people portray [her] to be,\" she asserts having no qualms about speaking her mind, even if faced with surmounting opposition, as long as she stands \"by what's right.\" These features were noted during the Bharat Shah Case, when she testified against the underworld; following this incident she was often called by journalists \"The only man in Bollywood\", a label she was unhappy with for its underlying anti-feminist connotations. Film actor Amitabh Bachchan, describing her as \"frank and painfully honest,\" lauded her \"drive and guts in a world that can be most cruel to a single girl.\" Author and columnist Shobhaa De, while commending her for lodging a molestation complaint against Ness Wadia in 2014, expressed concern regarding Zinta's repeated quest for justice, believing it could eventually play against her: \"India is not terribly kind to strong-willed, outspoken women who are dubbed 'trouble makers' if they dare to raise their voices, especially against men. Zinta is such a woman.\" Her characteristic dimple has been cited by the media as her trademark. At the beginning of her career, she was often described by the press as having a vivacious personality and a bubbly, outgoing persona, an image she had confessed to disliking. According to film critic Sukanya Verma, Zinta's energetic nature extends from her real-life into her appearances in films and is an integral part of her technique. In an article discussing Hindi film actresses and their flair for comedy, Verma wrote, \"What can you say about an actress who giggles non-stop in a tone that is anything but prim and propah? She is carefree. She is animated. She talks non-stop. She laughs all the time. She has a chilled out sense of humour. And a tomboyish streak too. Preity Zinta is all that and more. All this greatly contributes to her style of acting.\" Director Tanuja Chandra, while filming Sangharsh in 1998, ascribed Zinta's screen appeal to her lack of acting pretense, commenting, \"She doesn't act, she's so real that you just can't look away from her\". Reviewing Chori Chori Chupke Chupke for Hindustan Times, Vinayak Chakravorty noted that \"there is an admirable zest that Preity pumps into every role she does\". Farhan Akhtar, who directed her in two movies, believes she is an actress who \"can mould herself\u2014the way she speaks, works and her body language\u2014and adapt herself to roles,\" while Vidhu Vinod Chopra (director of Mission Kashmir) credits her with the ability to \"make the viewer believe even in the most convoluted situation.\" In a review of Salaam Namaste, Australian film critic Jake Wilson observed, \"While Preity Zinta isn't the subtlest actress, she's quite a comedienne\u00a0\u2014 for a Hollywood equivalent to her combination of beauty, high-strung emotion and facial gymnastics you might have to go back to Natalie Wood.\" American critic Derek Elley considers her to be \"one of Bollywood\u2019s best pure actresses.\" Following her portrayal of such characters as those in Sangharsh, Kya Kehna, Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, Salaam Namaste and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, Zinta gained a reputation for playing roles that go against Indian traditional mores and was often recognised for her versatility. Critics attributed her roles in these films as to establishing a new image for leading actresses in Bollywood. Karan Johar cites her as \"a new-wave actress\" who has the advantage of working at a time when \"films portray a woman who knows her mind\". In the book Once Upon a Time in Bollywood, it is stated that Zinta \"resists patriarchal constraints through her modern lifestyle and the controversial roles she chooses.\" Zinta is one of the best-known celebrities in India; at her career peak she was one of Hindi cinema's most celebrated and highest-paid stars and was acknowledged for having managed a career without any traditional assistance or family relations in the film industry. In 2003, Zinta appeared in the number one spot on Rediff's \"Top Bollywood Female Stars\". She was ranked second for the following three years. She has been featured frequently on other Rediff lists, including \"Bollywood's Most Beautiful Actresses\", \"Bollywood's Best Dressed Women\" and \"Women of Many Faces\". Between 2006 and 2008 Zinta made three consecutive appearances at the Cannes Film Festival. At first she attended the 2006 Film Festival along with filmmaker Karan Johar to represent the Hindi film industry and promote Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, returning in later years as the brand ambassador of Chopard, the maker of luxury watches and jewellery. In September 2006, the UK magazine Eastern Eye ranked her among \"Asia's Sexiest Women\". In 2010, Time magazine selected her as one of the candidates for its list of the world's 100 most influential people. She was the only Indian actress nominated for the poll and eventually did not make it to the final list, ranked at 144. This was followed, however, by a marked period of decline in her popularity when she restricted her work in films, which was further decreased with the debacle of her self-produced comeback vehicle. Among Zinta's film awards are two Filmfare Awards\u2014Best Female Debut for Dil Se.. and Soldier, and Best Actress for Kal Ho Naa Ho."

        "artist_name": "Prithviraj_Kapoor", 
        "biography": " Prithviraj Kapoor (3 November 1906\u00a0\u2013 29 May 1972) was a pioneer of Indian theatre and of the Hindi film industry, who started his career as an actor in the silent era of Hindi cinema, associated with IPTA as one of its founding members and who founded the Prithvi Theatres, a travelling theatre company based in Mumbai, in 1944. Born in Samundri, Punjab, British India (now in Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan), he was also the patriarch of the Kapoor family of Hindi films, four generations of which family, beginning with him, have played active roles in the Hindi film industry. However, his father, Basheshwarnath Nath Kapoor, also played a short role in his movie Awaara. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1969 and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1971 for his contributions towards Indian cinema.   Kapoor was born on 3 November 1906, in a Punjabi Hindu family, in Samundri, Punjab Province in British India, in what today is the Punjab province of Pakistan. His father, Basheshwarnath Kapoor, served as a police officer in the Indian Imperial Police in the city of Peshawar; while his grandfather, Keshavmal Kapoor, was a Tehsildar in Samundri, Punjab, British India. Surinder Kapoor, the famous Bollywood producer and father of actor Anil Kapoor was a first cousin of Prithviraj Kapoor. Kapoor began his acting career in the theatres of Lyallpur and Peshawar. In 1928, he moved to Bombay with a loan from an aunt. There he joined the Imperial Films Company. He acted as an extra in his first film, though he went on to earn a lead role for his third film, titled Cinema Girl, in 1929. After featuring in nine silent films, including Do Dhari Talwar, Sher-e-Arab and Prince Vijaykumar, Kapoor did a supporting role in India's first film talkie, Alam Ara (1931). His performance in Vidyapati (1937) was much appreciated.[by whom?] His best-known performance is perhaps as Alexander the Great in Sohrab Modi's Sikandar (1941). He also joined the Grant Anderson Theater Company, an English theatrical company that remained in Bombay for a year. Through all these years, Kapoor remained devoted to the theatre and performed on stage regularly. He developed a reputation as a very fine and versatile actor on both stage and screen. By 1944, Kapoor had the wherewithal and standing to found his own theatre group, Prithvi Theatres, whose premi\u00e8re performance was Kalidasa's Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntalam in 1942. His eldest son, Raj Kapoor, by 1946, had struck out on his own; the films he produced had been successful and this was also an enabling factor. Prithviraj invested in Prithvi Theatres, which staged memorable productions across India. The plays were highly influential and inspired young people to participate in the Indian independence movement and the Quit India Movement. In over 16 years of existence, the theatre staged some 2,662 performances. Prithviraj starred as the lead actor in every single show.[citation needed] One of his popular plays was called Pathan (1947), which was performed on stage nearly 600 times in Mumbai. It opened on 13 April 1947, and is a story of a Muslim and his Hindu friend. By the late 1950s, it was clear that the era of the travelling theatre had been irreversibly supplanted by the cinema and it was no longer financially feasible for a troupe of up to 80 people to travel the country for four to six months at a time along with their props and equipment and living in hotels and campsites. The financial returns, through ticket sales and the rapidly diminishing largesse of patrons from the erstwhile princely class of India, was not enough to support such an effort. Many of the fine actors and technicians that Prithvi Theatres nurtured had found their way to the movies. Indeed, this was the case with all of Prithviraj's own sons. As Kapoor progressed into his 50s, he gradually ceased theatre activities and accepted occasional offers from film-makers, including his own sons. He appeared with his son Raj in the 1951 film Awara as a stern judge who had thrown his own wife out of his house. Later, under his son, Shashi Kapoor, and his wife Jennifer Kendal, Prithvi Theatre merged with the Indian Shakespeare theatre company, \"Shakespeareana\", and the company got a permanent home, with the inauguration of the Prithvi Theatre in Mumbai on 5 November 1978. In 1996, the Golden Jubilee year of the founding of Prithvi Theatre, India Post, issued a special two Rupee commemorative postage stamp. It featured the logo of the theatre, the dates 1945\u20131995, and an image Kapoor. The first day cover, (stamped 15-1-95) showed an illustration of performance of travelling theatre in progress, on a stage that seem fit for a travelling theatre, as Prithvi theatre was for sixteen, till 1960. On the occasion of 100 years of the Indian cinema, another postage stamp, bearing his face, was released by India Post on 3 May 2013. His filmography of this period includes Mughal E Azam (1960) where he gave his most memorable performance as the Mughal emperor Akbar, Harishchandra Taramati (1963) where he played the lead role and unforgettable performances as Porus in Sikandar-e-Azam (1965) and the stentorian grandfather in Kal Aaj Aur Kal (1971) where he appeared with his son Raj Kapoor and grandson Randhir Kapoor.[citation needed] Kapoor starred in the legendary religious Punjabi film Nanak Nam Jahaz Hai (1969), a film so revered in Punjab that there were lines many kilometres long to purchase tickets.[citation needed] He also starred in the Punjabi films Nanak Dukhiya Sub Sansar (1970) and Mele Mittran De (1972). He also acted in a Kannada movie Sakshatkara (1971) directed by Kannada director Puttanna Kanagal. He acted as Rajkumar's father in that movie. In 1954, he was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship, and in 1969, the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India. He remained Nominated Rajya Sabha Member for eight years. He was posthumously awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for the year 1971. He was the third recipient of that award, the highest accolade in Indian cinema. Kapoor was aged 17 when he was married to the 14-year-old Ramsarni Mehra, a lady of his own community and similar background, in a match arranged by their parents. The marriage was harmonious and conventional. Ramsarni's brother, Jugal Kishore Mehra, would later enter films. The couple's eldest child, Raj Kapoor, was born in December 1924. By the time Prithviraj moved to Mumbai in 1927, the couple were the parents of three children. In 1930, Ramsarni joined Prithviraj in Mumbai. The following year, while she was pregnant for the fourth time, two of their sons died in the space of one week. One of their children, Devinder (Devi), died of double-pneumonia while the other child, Ravinder (Bindi), died of poisoning in a freak incident when he swallowed rat-poison pills strewn in the garden. The couple went on to have three more children: sons Shamsher Raj (Shammi) and Balbir Raj (Shashi) (who were to become famous actors and filmmakers in their own right) and daughter, Urmila Sial.[citation needed] After his retirement, Prithviraj settled in a cottage called Prithvi Jhonpra near Juhu beach. The property was on lease, which was bought by Shashi Kapoor, and later converted into a small, experimental theatre, the Prithvi Theatre. Both Prithviraj and Ramsarni had cancer and died about a fortnight apart: Prithviraj died on 29 May 1972 and was followed by his wife on 14 June.[citation needed]"

        "artist_name": "Priyanka_Chopra", 
        "biography": " Priyanka Chopra (pronounced\u00a0[pr\u026a\u02c8ja\u02d0\u014bka\u02d0 \u02c8t\u0283o\u02d0p\u027da\u02d0]; born 18 July 1982) is an Indian actress, singer, film producer, philanthropist, and the winner of the Miss World 2000 pageant. One of India's highest-paid and most popular celebrities, Chopra has received numerous awards, including a National Film Award and five Filmfare Awards. In 2016, the Government of India honoured her with the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award, and Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Although Chopra initially aspired to study aeronautical engineering, she accepted offers to join the Indian film industry, which came as a result of her pageant wins, making her Bollywood debut in The Hero (2003). She played the leading lady in the box-office hits Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), and earned praise for her breakout role in the 2004 thriller Aitraaz. In 2006, Chopra established herself as a leading actress of Indian cinema with starring roles in the top-grossing productions Krrish and Don. Following a brief setback, she received critical acclaim for playing a troubled model in the drama Fashion (2008), which won her the Filmfare and National Film Award for Best Actress. Chopra subsequently gained wider recognition for portraying a range of characters in the films Kaminey (2009), 7 Khoon Maaf (2011), Barfi! (2012), Mary Kom (2014), Dil Dhadakne Do (2015) and Bajirao Mastani (2015), all of which garnered her several awards and nominations. In 2015, she began starring as Alex Parrish on the ABC thriller series Quantico, becoming the first South Asian to headline an American network series. In addition to her acting career, Chopra is noted for her philanthropic work. She has worked with UNICEF for the last ten years and was appointed as the national and global UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Child Rights in 2010 and 2016 respectively. She promotes various causes such as environment, health and education, and women's rights and is particularly vocal about gender equality and feminism. Chopra's off-screen life is the subject of substantial media coverage. As a recording artist, she has released three singles. She is also the founder of the production company Purple Pebble Pictures, which released the acclaimed Marathi comedy-drama Ventilator (2016).   Priyanka Chopra was born on 18 July 1982 in Jamshedpur, Bihar (now in Jharkhand), to Ashok and Madhu Chopra, both physicians in the Indian Army. Her father was a Punjabi from Ambala. Her mother, from Jharkhand, is the eldest daughter of Ms. Madhu Jyotsna Akhouri, a former member of Bihar Legislative Assembly, and Dr. Manohar Kishan Akhouri, a former Congress veteran. Chopra has a brother, Siddharth, who is seven years her junior and actresses Parineeti Chopra, Meera Chopra and Mannara Chopra are her cousins. Due to her parents' occupations the family relocated to a number of places in India, including Delhi, Chandigarh, Ambala, Ladakh, Lucknow, Bareilly, and Pune. Among the schools she attended were La Martiniere Girls' School in Lucknow and St. Maria Goretti College in Bareilly. In an interview published in Daily News and Analysis, Chopra said that she did not mind travelling regularly and changing schools; she welcomed it as a new experience and a way to discover India's multicultural society. Among the many places that she lived, Chopra has fond memories as a child of playing in the valleys of Leh, in the cold northwestern Indian desert region of Jammu and Kashmir. She has said, \"I think I was in Class 4 when I was in Leh. My brother was just born. My dad was in the army and was posted there. I stayed in Leh for a year and my memories of that place are tremendous\u00a0... We were all army kids there. We weren't living in houses, we were in bunkers in the valley and there was a stupa right on top of a hill which used to overlook our valley. We used to race up to the top of the stupa\". She now considers Bareilly her home town, and maintains strong connections there. At the age of thirteen, Chopra moved to the United States to study, living with her aunt, and attending schools in Newton, Massachusetts, and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, after a stop in Queens, New York, as her aunt's family also moved frequently. While in Massachusetts, she participated in several theatre productions and studied Western classical music, choral singing and Kathak dance. During her teenage years in America, Chopra sometimes faced racial issues and was bullied for being Indian. She has said, \"I was a gawky kid, had low self-esteem, came from a modest middle-class background, had white marks on my legs\u00a0... But I was damn hard working. Today, my legs sell 12 brands.\" After three years, Chopra returned to India, finishing the senior year of her high-school education at the Army Public School in Bareilly. During this period, she won the local \"May Queen\" beauty pageant, after which she was pursued by admirers, leading her family to equip their home with bars for her protection. Her mother then entered her in the Femina Miss India contest of 2000; she finished second,[a] winning the Femina Miss India World title. Chopra then went on to the Miss World pageant, where she was crowned Miss World 2000 and Miss World Continental Queen of Beauty\u2014Asia & Oceania at the Millennium Dome in London on 30 November 2000. Chopra was the fifth Indian contestant to win Miss World, and the fourth to do so in seven years. She had enrolled in college, but left after winning the Miss World pageant. Chopra said that the Miss India and Miss World titles brought her recognition, and she then began receiving offers for film roles. Chopra has maintained a strong relationship with her family, including her younger brother, Siddharth, and lives in an apartment on the same floor as her family. She was especially close to her father, who died in June 2013; in 2012, she got a tattoo reading \"Daddy's lil girl\", in his handwriting. Having not come from a film background, she describes herself as a self-made woman. Her mother, a well-established gynaecologist in Bareilly, gave up her practice to support Chopra as she embarked upon a film career. After winning Miss India World, Chopra was cast as the female lead in Abbas-Mustan's romantic thriller Humraaz (2002), in which she was to make her film debut. However, this fell through for various reasons: she stated the production conflicted with her schedule, while the producers said they re-cast because Chopra took on various other commitments. Her screen debut occurred in the 2002 Tamil film Thamizhan as the love interest of the protagonist, played by Vijay. A review published in The Hindu was appreciative of the film for its wit and dialogue, however it felt that Chopra's role was limited from an acting viewpoint. In 2003, Chopra made her Bollywood film debut as the second female lead opposite Sunny Deol and Preity Zinta in Anil Sharma's The Hero: Love Story of a Spy. Set against the backdrop of the Indian Army in Kashmir, the film tells the story of an agent and his fight against terrorism. The Hero was one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films that year, but received mixed reviews from critics. Derek Elley from Variety said that \"mega-looker Chopra makes a solid screen debut.\" Later that year she appeared in Raj Kanwar's box-office success Andaaz with Akshay Kumar, again sharing the female lead (this time with the debuting Lara Dutta). Chopra played a vivacious young girl who falls in love with Kumar's character. The Hindustan Times noted the glamour that she brought to the role; Kunal Shah of Sify praised her performance and stated she had \"all the qualities to be a star.\" Her performance earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut (along with Dutta) and a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Chopra's first three releases in 2004\u2014Plan, Kismat, and Asambhav\u2014performed poorly at the box-office. Chopra was typically cast during this earlier period as a \"glamour quotient\", in roles that were considered \"forgettable\" by film critic Joginder Tuteja. Later that year she starred with Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar in David Dhawan's romantic comedy Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, which became the third-highest-grossing film of the year in India and emerged as a major commercial success. In late 2004, she starred opposite Kumar and Kareena Kapoor in Abbas-Mustan's thriller Aitraaz. Chopra considers her first role as an antagonist, portraying Soniya Roy, an ambitious woman who accuses her employee of sexual harassment, as the \"biggest learning experience of her career.\" The film was a critical and commercial success, and Chopra's performance received critical acclaim. Author Rini Bhattacharya credited her for bringing back the seductress to the silver screen. The Hindustan Times cited it as the film that changed her career significantly. A reviewer writing for the BBC said, \"Aitraaz is Priyanka Chopra's film. As the deliciously wicked, gold digging, scheming seductress, she chews up every scene she is in with her magnetic screen presence.\" She won a Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, becoming the second and final actress to win the award after Kajol (the category was discontinued in 2008). Chopra also received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress, and the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. In 2005, Chopra appeared in six films. Her first two releases\u2014Blackmail, and Karam\u2014were commercially unsuccessful. Shilpa Bharatan-Iyer of Rediff.com considered Blackmail to be a very predictable film and believed that her role as a police commissioner's wife was very limited from an acting point of view. Her performance in Karam was better received, Subhash K. Jha wrote that Chopra \"with her poised interpretation of high drama, flies high creating a character whose vulnerability and beauty are endorsed by both the inner and outer worlds created for her character.\" Later that year Chopra played the wife of Akshay Kumar in Vipul Amrutlal Shah's family drama Waqt: The Race Against Time, the story of a small businessman (played by Amitabh Bachchan) who, hiding his illness, wants to teach his irresponsible son some lessons before he dies. During production, Chopra revisited Leh, a favourite childhood haunt, for the shooting of the song \"Subah Hogi\". She suffered an accident during the filming for the song \"Do Me A Favour Let's Play Holi\" when she electrocuted herself, spending a day recovering in hospital. The film was well received by critics, and was a commercial success. She next starred opposite Arjun Rampal in the romantic mystery thriller Yakeen, portraying the role of a possessive lover. Critical reaction towards the film was mixed, but her performance received praise. Taran Adarsh wrote that Chopra \"is bound to win laurels yet again [...] the actor is emerging as one of the finest talents in these fast-changing times\". Her next release was Suneel Darshan's romance Barsaat, co-starring Bobby Deol and Bipasha Basu. The film was a critical and commercial failure in India but fared better in the overseas market. Chopra's performance received mixed reviews, with Bollywood Hungama describing it as \"mechanical\". However, Rediff.com considered Chopra to be an \"epitome of calm intelligence, who underplayed her role to perfection\". Later that year, Rohan Sippy cast her with Abhishek Bachchan, Ritesh Deshmukh and Nana Patekar in the comedy Bluffmaster! Chopra played independent working woman Simran Saxena, Bachchan's love interest. The film proved to be a box-office success. After starting 2006 with special appearances in three films, Chopra starred in Rakesh Roshan's superhero film Krrish (a sequel to the 2003 science-fiction film Koi... Mil Gaya). Co-starring with Hrithik Roshan, Rekha and Naseeruddin Shah, Chopra played a young television journalist who schemes to take advantage of an innocent young man with remarkable physical abilities, but eventually falls in love with him. The film was the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India and grossed over \u20b91.17 billion (US$18\u00a0million) worldwide attaining a blockbuster status. Her next film was Dharmesh Darshan's romantic comedy Aap Ki Khatir, co-starring Akshaye Khanna, Ameesha Patel and Dino Morea. Neither the film nor Chopra's performance were well received. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com stated that Chopra's portrayal of Anu was \"erratically sketched\" and that her character was never consistent: \"first flaky, then cool, and later, sensitive\". Chopra's final release of 2006 was Farhan Akhtar's action-thriller Don (a remake of the 1978 film of the same name), with Shah Rukh Khan. Chopra portrayed Roma (played by Zeenat Aman in the original film), who joins the underworld to avenge Don for killing her brother. Chopra received martial-arts training for her role in the movie, and performed her own stunts. The film was declared a box-office success in India and overseas, with revenues of \u20b91.05 billion (US$16\u00a0million). Raja Sen of Rediff.com found Chopra to be film's \"big surprise\"; he believed that Chopra convincingly portrayed Roma, \"looking every bit the competent woman of action\" and wrote \"This is an actress willing to push herself, and has definite potential for screen magic. Not to mention a great smile.\" In 2007, Chopra had two leading roles. Her first film was Nikhil Advani's Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love, a romantic comedy in six chapters with an ensemble cast. She was featured opposite Salman Khan in the first chapter as Kamini, an item girl and aspiring actress who tries to land the lead role in a Karan Johar film with a publicity gimmick. Film critic Sukanya Verma praised her flair for comedy, especially her impressions of Meena Kumari, Nargis and Madhubala. Both Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love and her next film, Big Brother, proved unsuccessful at the domestic box-office. In 2008, Chopra starred opposite Harman Baweja in his father's Love Story 2050. Chopra played a double role, so she coloured her hair twice; once red to portray the girl from the future and then black for the girl of the past. Her performance was poorly received; Rajeev Masand was unimpressed with Chopra's chemistry with her co-star, remarking that her character \"fails to inspire either affection or sympathy\". She next appeared in the comedy God Tussi Great Ho, portraying a TV anchor opposite Salman Khan, Sohail Khan and Amitabh Bachchan. The film was generally perceived to be plagiarised from the Hollywood comedy Bruce Almighty, although writer and director Rumi Jaffrey claimed it to be \"a village folk tale about a Brahmin\". Chopra next starred as a kindergarten teacher in Chamku opposite Bobby Deol and Irrfan Khan, and played the role of Sonia in Goldie Behl's fantasy superhero film Drona opposite Abhishek Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan. Drona, widely criticised for its extensive use of special effects, marked Chopra's sixth film in succession which had failed at both the box-office and critically, although Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com stated that Chopra displayed convincing action heroine skills. Critics generally perceived at this time that her career was over. The string of poorly received films ended when Chopra starred in Madhur Bhandarkar's Fashion, a drama about the Indian fashion industry which followed the lives and careers of several fashion models. She portrayed the ambitious supermodel Meghna Mathur, a role which she initially thought was out of her depth, but after six months' consideration she accepted the role, inspired by Bhandarkar's confidence in her. For the role, Chopra had to gain 6 kilograms (13\u00a0lb) and steadily shed the weight during the production as the character progressed in the film. Both the film and her performance received critical acclaim, becoming a major turning point in her career. Rajeev Masand wrote, \"Priyanka Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best.\" For her performance, she won several awards, including the National Film Award for Best Actress, the Filmfare Award for Best Actress, the IIFA Award for Best Actress, the Screen Award for Best Actress, and the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. With a worldwide revenue of \u20b9600 million (US$9\u00a0million), Fashion emerged as a commercial success, and was listed by Subhash K. Jha as one of the best films of the decade with women protagonists. It was noted for being commercially successful despite being a women-centric film with no male lead. She said in retrospect, \"I think actually Fashion kick started\u00a0... the process of female dominated films. Today you have so many other films which have done well with female leads.\" Chopra's final film of the year was Tarun Mansukhani's romantic comedy Dostana, with Abhishek Bachchan and John Abraham. Set in Miami, the film tells the story of a friendship between her character and two men who pretend to be gay to share an apartment with her. Chopra played a stylish young fashion-magazine editor Neha, who is trying to deal with professional pressures in her life. Produced by Dharma Productions, the film was a financial success with worldwide revenues of over \u20b9860 million (US$13\u00a0million). Chopra's performance and look in the film were praised. The following year Chopra played a feisty Marathi woman named Sweety in Vishal Bhardwaj's caper thriller Kaminey (co-starring Shahid Kapoor), about twin brothers and the journey in their life linked with the underworld. The film received critical acclaim and became successful at the box-office with the worldwide gross earnings of \u20b9710 million (US$11\u00a0million). Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India thought that Chopra's role completely reinvented her, and Rajeev Masand wrote: \"Springing a delightful surprise in a smaller part is [Chopra], who sprinkles her lines with a smattering of fluent Marathi and emerges one of the film's most lovable characters.\" Raja Sen of Rediff.com named Chopra's performance as the best by an actress that year. Her role earned her several awards and nominations, including a second consecutive Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role after Fashion and Best Actress nominations at the Filmfare, Screen and IIFA awards. Chopra subsequently appeared in Ashutosh Gowariker's romantic comedy What's Your Raashee?, based on the novel Kimball Ravenswood by Madhu Rye. The film depicts the story of a US-based Gujrati NRI in search of his soulmate among 12 girls (all played by Chopra) associated with the 12 zodiac signs. She received the Screen Best Actress Award nomination for her performance in the film. She was also considered for inclusion in the Guinness World Records book for being the first film actress to portray 12 distinct characters in one film. Chopra's heavy workload\u2014filming for several productions, travelling for endorsements and performing at live shows (including the Miss India pageant)\u2014took its toll; she fainted during filming, and was admitted to hospital. In 2010, Chopra starred with Uday Chopra in Jugal Hansraj's unremarkable romantic comedy Pyaar Impossible! as Alisha, a beautiful college girl (and later a working mother) who falls in love with a nerdy boy. Later that year, she co-starred with Ranbir Kapoor in Siddharth Anand's romantic comedy Anjaana Anjaani. The film, set in New York and Las Vegas, follows the story of two strangers, both trying to commit suicide, who eventually fall in love with each other. The film was a moderate commercial success, and her performance received mixed reviews from critics. Sarita Tanwar of Mid Day wrote, \"Priyanka Chopra is at her casual and spontaneous best. She embraces the character completely and makes it totally believable\", while Anupama Chopra dismissed her acting as \"artificial\". She starred as a femme fatale in her first film of 2011, Vishal Bhardwaj's black comedy 7 Khoon Maaf. Based on the short story \"Susanna's Seven Husbands\" by Ruskin Bond, 7 Khoon Maaf centres on Susanna Anna-Marie Johannes, an Anglo-Indian woman (played by Chopra) who murders her seven husbands in an unending quest for love. The film and her performance received acclaim from critics. Nikhat Kazmi remarked, \"7 Khoon Maaf would undoubtedly end up as a milestone in Priyanka Chopra's career graph. The actor displays exquisite command over a complex character that is definitely a first in Indian cinema.\" Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis wrote: \"Priyanka Chopra takes on a character that most of her contemporaries would shy away from and enacts it in a way that only she possibly can. For a woman with as many shades as Susanna, Chopra gets a crack at a role of a lifetime and she sparkles like never before.\" Chopra's performance earned her the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress and a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress, the IIFA Award for Best Actress, the Screen Award for Best Actress, and the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Chopra's final release of the year saw her reprising her role as Roma in the second installment of the Don franchise, Don 2. Although the film received mixed reviews, Chopra's performance earned positive feedback from critics. According to The Express Tribune, \"Chopra\u00a0... seems to be the perfect choice for an action heroine. As you watch her effortlessly beat up some thugs in the movie, you come to the realisation that she may be the first proper female action hero in Bollywood.\" Don 2 was a major success in India and overseas, earning over \u20b92.06 billion (US$32\u00a0million) worldwide. Don 2 was showcased at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival and (with Don) at the 2012 International Film Festival of Marrakech, in Morocco. Chopra's first film of 2012 was Karan Malhotra's action drama Agneepath, in which she starred with Hrithik Roshan, Sanjay Dutt and Rishi Kapoor. Produced by Karan Johar, the film is a remake of his father's 1990 production of the same name. In one of several accidents to happen during production, Chopra's lehenga (a traditional skirt) caught fire while filming a sequence for an elaborate Ganpati festival song. She featured as Kaali Gawde, Roshan's loquacious love interest in the film. Mayank Shekhar noted how much Chopra stood out in the male-dominated film. Agneepath broke Bollywood's highest opening-day earnings record, and had a worldwide gross of \u20b91.93 billion (US$30\u00a0million). Chopra next co-starred with Shahid Kapoor in Kunal Kohli's romance, Teri Meri Kahaani. The film relates the stories of three unconnected couples (each played by Kapoor and Chopra), born in different eras. The film opened to mixed reactions from critics, but Chopra's performance was generally well received. Anurag Basu's Barfi!, with Ranbir Kapoor and Ileana D'Cruz, was her final appearance of 2012. Set in the 1970s, the film tells the story of three people, two of whom are physically disabled. Chopra played Jhilmil Chatterjee, an autistic woman who falls in love with a deaf, mute man (Kapoor). Rituparno Ghosh, an acclaimed director, considered it a \"very, very brave\" role to accept given how demanding it is for an actor to convincingly portray a woman with autism. To prepare for the role, Chopra visited several mental institutions and spent time with autistic people. The film received rave reviews from film critics and was a major commercial success, earning \u20b91.75 billion (US$27\u00a0million) worldwide. Chopra received unanimous praise for her portrayal, which several reviewers regarded as her best performance at that time. The Indo-Asian News Service review said, \"Priyanka Chopra as the autistic Jhilmil steals the show from Ranbir, if that's possible. Her inherent glamorous personality simply disappears into her character. We don't see the actress on screen at all! We see only Jhilmil who reminds us in a very pleasant way of Sridevi in Sadma. This is one of the most flawless interpretations of a physical-psychological disability seen on celluloid.\" Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph noted Ranbir and Priyanka turn in two of the finest performances seen on the Indian screen. Chopra received Best Actress nominations at the Filmfare, Screen, IIFA and Producers Guild Film Awards. The film was screened at the Busan and Marrakech International Film Festivals, and was chosen as India's entry for the 85th Academy Awards. Don 2, Agneepath and Barfi! rank among the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time. In 2013, she lent her voice to the character of Ishani, the reigning Pan-Asian champion from India and the love interest of the main protagonist in the Disney Animation Studios's film Planes, a spinoff of Pixar's Cars franchise. Chopra, a fan of Disney films, had fun voicing the character saying \"The closest I could come to being a Disney princess, I think, was Ishani\". The film was a commercial success, grossing approximately US$240 million worldwide. She played an NRI girl in the Apoorva Lakhia's bilingual action drama Zanjeer (Thoofan in Telugu), a remake of the 1973 Hindi film of the same name, which met with poor reactions from critics and was unsuccessful at the box office. Chopra next reprised her role of Priya in Rakesh Roshan's Krrish 3\u2014a sequel to the 2006 superhero film Krrish\u2014with Hrithik Roshan, Vivek Oberoi and Kangana Ranaut. The film earned positive reviews though critics opined that Chopra's role in the film was small. Writing for Daily News and Analysis, Sarita A Tanwar commented that \"Priyanka is saddled with a role that doesn't do her justice. She deserved a meatier role.\" The feature became a box office success, earning over \u20b93 billion (US$46\u00a0million) worldwide, to become Chopra's biggest commercial success till date and her fourth major hit in the last two years. She also appeared in an item number titled \"Ram Chahe Leela\" for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela. The song, which took four days to rehearse, saw Chopra execute a contemporary mujra, that incorporated complicated dance steps. In 2014, Chopra played the lead female role in Yash Raj Films's romantic action drama Gunday directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, alongside Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor and Irrfan Khan. She portrayed Nandita, a cabaret dancer in Calcutta. Set in the 1970s, the film tells the story of two best friends, who fall in love with Chopra's character. Gunday proved to be a box-office success, grossing over \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide.

In the article, Chopra expressed her views about the safety of women in cities. She wrote: \"The magnitude of this crime can perhaps only truly be understood by a woman. It has much larger ramifications. We can't allow this to happen. We have to, in whichever way we can, ensure that what happened with Pallavi does not happen again. We need to remind ourselves that we women today are a vital contributor to the growth of the new India.\" In a July 2014 article published in The Guardian, she criticised female genital mutilation and child marriage. She wrote: \"These practices violate the fundamental rights of girls and women, and hold back social and economic development that would benefit children, communities and countries.

The Times of India called her a \"game changer\" and added that she \"made the age-old demarcation between a hero and heroine redundant and one can easily describe her as a Shero\". In 2012, film critic Subhash K. Jha labelled her \"the best actress in the post-Sridevi generation\" and listed her character in Barfi! as being \"one of the finest inwardly ravaged characters in Bollywood.\" Chopra has often featured on Rediff.com's annual listing of \"Bollywood's Best Actresses\", and was featured in their list of \"Top 10 Actresses of 2000\u20132010\".

        "biography": " Rajendra Kumar Tuli (20 July 1929 \u2013 12 July 1999) was an Indian film actor who starred in Bollywood films. Starting his career in 1950, he appeared in more than 80 films in a career spanning over four decades. He was considered as one of the most successful Indian Bollywood actors in the 1960s. He also produced several films starring his son Kumar Gaurav. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri in 1969. He was born in a Punjabi Hindu family in Sialkot, in the Punjab province of British India, .   Rajendra Kumar's family was based in Punjab, British India. His grandfather was a successful military contractor and his father had a textile business in Karachi, Sindh, British India. During the Partition of India, the family had to leave all the land and property behind and move to India. When they came to Bombay, Kumar decided to try his luck in the Hindi film industry. He never wanted to be a hero and took up work with director H. S. Rawail as an assistant. For nearly five years, he worked with Rawail as an assistant in films like Patanga, Sagai, Pocketmaar. During this time he made his film debut with a small role in Kidar Sharma's 1950 film Jogan, opposite Dilip Kumar and Nargis. It was producer Devendra Goel who noticed Kumar in Jogan and gave him a break in Vachan in 1955. Kumar was paid only fifteen hundred rupees for the film; however, the film was a hit and was Kumar's first silver jubilee film and he was given a title \u2013 'A star is Born'. He got further success with his supporting role in Mehboob Khan's blockbuster epic film Mother India in 1957 in which he played Nargis's character's son. His first major success as a romantic leading man was in Amit Saxena's musical Goonj Uthi Shehnai (1959), co-starring Ameeta. The 1960s saw Kumar rise to stardom. There were times when he had six or seven films which had run for more than 25 weeks (known in India as a \"silver jubilee film\"), all running at the cinema at the same time, which rendered him the nickname \"Jubilee Kumar\". He starred in many box office hits including Dhool Ka Phool (1959), Dil Ek Mandir (1963), Mere Mehboob (1963), Sangam (1964), Arzoo (1965), Suraj (1966), Talash and Ganwaar (1970). He received the Filmfare Nomination for Best Actor for Dil Ek Mandir (1963), Ayee Milan Ki Bela (1964), Arzoo (1965), and as Best Supporting Actor for Sangam (1964). From 1972 onwards, he faced competition from Rajesh Khanna and many of his films were flops. He then switched to character roles in the late 1970s and 1980s. He was offered a role in the film Saajan Bina Suhaagan opposite Nutan in 1978 which was a success. He also starred in a number of Punjabi films like Teri meri ek jindari. In 1981 Rajendra introduced his son Kumar Gaurav in the film Love Story which he produced and also starred in. The film was declared a blockbuster. Rajendra produced several other films starring his son including Naam, which also featured his son's brother-in-law Sanjay Dutt, in leading role. He produced and acted with his son again in the 1993 film Phool. In 1995 he acted in the television serial Andaz which was his last acting role. He married Shukla (producer/director O P Ralhan's sister) and had a son and two daughters. His son Kumar Gaurav also had a brief acting career. Kumar acted with Sunil Dutt and Nargis in the film Mother India (1957) where Sunil Dutt and Rajendra Kumar played natural sons of Nargis's character. He had a special relationship with Dutt and used to actively participate in campaigning for him, whenever the latter used to contest for elections. Dutt quoted as having said that \"Even though Rajendra Kumar did not win any award throughout his career, he was one of the most genuine human beings I have ever encountered. When I was struggling with the troubles related to the arrest of my son Sanjay Dutt and my house was repeatedly being searched by means of numerous police raids, Rajendra Kumar was the one who came to my rescue by staying at my house and ensuring that raids were conducted using due procedures, false evidences were not planted in the house and valuables were not stolen.\"[this quote needs a citation] Kumar was best friends with Raj Kapoor, so much so that his son Kumar Gaurav was engaged to the latter's daughter, Reema. As fate would have it, this friendship could not last long after their children broke the engagement and Kumar Gaurav got married to Sunil Dutt and Nargis's daughter Namrata. He attained a Ph.D. and had a title of 'Doctor' prefixed to his name. For the premier of his film Vachan, he was asked if he wanted any seats for his relatives or friends, and thinking that it would be complimentary, he answered ten. After some days when he went to get his fees from the producer's accountant, he was given a lesser amount and when he asked why he was told that the money was deducted for the seats he took for his relatives and friends. He took this lesson as a principle of production and when he produced Naam, he deducted some amount from Amrita Singh's fees for the long calls she had made from Hong Kong to India. Known to refuse taking any medication, he succumbed to cancer on 12 July 1999, just a day after his son's 39th birthday, and just 8 days before his 70th birthday. Rajendra Kumar was nominated for Best Actor award three times.[clarification needed] Rajendra Kumar was nominated for 3 Filmfare Awards. Once as Best Supporting Actor and remaining as Best Actor. He nominated thrice as Best Actor and once as Best Supporting Actor, as shown below."

G.P. Sippy and Nasir Hussain were the first to sign Rajesh Khanna after he won the contest. Aakhri Khat was India\u2019s entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 40th Oscar Academy Awards in 1967. Khanna in an interview to Hindu newspaper said, \"Though 'Aakhri Khat' is my first film, I received my first break as a leading actor in Ravindra Dave's, 'Raaz' in 1967. My heroine was Babita, already a popular actress then. Though I had lots of confidence, I was shy in facing the camera initially. In my first three shots, I had to perform with stress on my body language and dialogue delivery. Though I was right with my dialogues, my movements were not up to the mark. Ravindra Dave explained me my scenes and movements very clearly correcting my way of walking.\" Being under contract with United Producers, he got projects like Aurat, Doli and Ittefaq. He was then noticed for his performances in films like Baharon Ke Sapne, Aurat (1967), Doli, Aradhana and Ittefaq. In Bahraon Ke Sapne, the response from the public in the first week of run forced the film's ending to be changed from a tragic one to happier one from the second week. Later Waheeda Rehman suggested Asit Sen to take Khanna for the lead role in Khamoshi. Through Aradhana he rose to \"instant national fame\" and film critics referred to him as the first superstar of India. Rajesh Khanna was cast in a double role (father and son) opposite Sharmila Tagore and Farida Jalal. It also saw the resurgence of Kishore Kumar, who eventually became the official playback voice of Rajesh Khanna. They worked together until Kishore's death in 1987 and songs of their combination were released until 1991. In 1971, he acted in Haathi Mere Saathi, which became that year's highest-grossing film and the biggest grosser ever till then. Khanna is credited with giving Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar their first chance to become screenplay writers by offering them work in Haathi Mere Saathi. Javed Akhthar accepted in an interview: \"One day, he went to Salimsaab and said that Mr. Devar had given him a huge signing amount with which he could complete the payment for his bungalow Aashirwad. But the film's script was far from being satisfactory. He told us that if we could set right the script, he would make sure we got both money and credit.\" Rajesh bought Rajendra Kumar's bungalow named Dimple in Carter Road for 31\u00a0lakhs in 1970 and renamed it Ashirwaad. In 1972, Khanna acted in 11 releases of which 10 became successful, including a guest appearance in Telugu movie called Bangaru Babu directed by V.B. Rajendra Prasad. His Hindi films Dushman, Amar Prem,Apna Desh and Mere Jeevan Saathi, together earned more than Rs.5 crore. His other films of 1972 like Dil Daulat Duniya, Bawarchi,Joroo Ka Ghulam, Shehzada earned more than Rs.4.5 crores. His next release Anuraag was a hit. As per the review of Raja Rani (1973 film) made in 2014 by the Hindu newspaper, the film did well at the box office and taking into consideration, the inflation as of 2014, the film would have grossed more than 100 crores. The attire worn by Khanna was sleeveless shirt and trousers, thick leather belt on waist, shoes without socks and a black cap. The Hindu review noted \"On a lesser actor, the attire would have fallen flat, but Khanna, as a small time thief, carries it with characteristic \u00e9lan.\" Rajesh acted alongside Mumtaz in eight films. They were neighbours and got along very well, which translated onto the screen. Mumtaz stated \"I would pull his leg and tease him about his fan following. Whenever Rajesh entered a hotel in Madras, there was a queue of 600 girls waiting to see him at midnight. As a result, even I would get some importance, as people would ask for my autograph as well. He was very generous with his associates, and would party a lot.\" During the peak of his career he would be mobbed during public appearances. Fans kissed his car, which would be covered with lipstick marks, and lined the road, cheering and chanting his name. Female fans sent him letters written in their blood. There used to be a line of cars of his producers and hysterical fans outside his bungalow every day. Actor Mehmood parodied him in Bombay to Goa where the driver and conductor of the bus were called 'Rajesh' and 'Khanna'. Even today, he remains the favourite of mimicry artists, who copy his trademark style and dialogue delivery. During the filming of Amar Prem there was a scene that needed to be shot at Howrah Bridge with a boat carrying Khanna and Sharmila under the bridge. The authorities ruled this scene out as they realised that if the public found out that the star would be there, it may create problems on the bridge and that it might collapse due to the amount of people trying to get a glimpse of their favourite actor. Film critic Monojit Lahiri remembers \"Girls married themselves to photographs of Rajesh Khanna, cutting their fingers and applying the blood as sindoor. Rajesh was God, there has never been such hysteria.\" In year 1974,Filmfare Awards were held honouring the films released in year 1973.Khanna was nominated for his performance in a complicated role in Daag. However, since Rishi Kapoor had paid Rs.30,000 to receive the Best Actor award for Bobby, Khanna did not win the award for his performance in Daag. Several songs sung by Kishore Kumar in the 1970s were based on Rajesh Khanna. During the filming of the song 'Mere Sapnon Ki Rani' in Aradhana, Sharmila Tagore was shooting for a Satyajit Ray film and director Shakti Samanta had to shoot their scenes separately and then join the scenes together. In the 1970s, his chemistry with Sharmila Tagore, Mumtaz, Asha Parekh, Zeenat Aman, Tanuja and Hema Malini were also popular with audiences. The BBC made a film on him, titled Bombay Superstar, in 1973. Shooting began when he got married and his film Daag premiered. In the video it can be noticed that Khanna was shooting for Aap Ki Kasam. A textbook prescribed by the Mumbai University contained an essay, 'The Charisma of Rajesh Khanna!' Sharmila Tagore said in interview to The Indian Express that \"women came out in droves to see Kaka. They would stand in queues outside the studios to catch a glimpse, they would marry his photographs, they would pull at his clothes. Delhi girls were crazier for him than Mumbai girls. He needed police protection when he was in public. I have never seen anything like this before and since.\" Music remained one of the biggest attractions of all Rajesh Khanna films throughout his career. Many of the musical scores for Khanna's films were composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal Sachin Dev Burman and R. D. Burman. The trio of Rajesh Khanna, Kishore Kumar and R.D. Burman went on to make a number of popular films, including Kati Patang, Amar Prem, Shehzada, Apna Desh, Mere Jeevan Saathi, Aap Ki Kasam, Ajnabee, Namak Haraam, Maha Chor, Karm, Phir Wohi Raat, Aanchal, Kudrat, Ashanti, Agar Tum Na Hote, Awaaz, Hum Dono and Alag Alag. Rajesh Khanna had 15 consecutive solo hit films between 1969 and 1971. These were Aradhana, Doli, Bandhan, Ittefaq, Do Raaste, Khamoshi, Safar, The Train, Kati Patang, Sachaa Jhutha, Aan Milo Sajna, Mehboob Ki Mehendi, Choti Bahu, Anand and Haathi Mere Saathi. He had 17 consecutive hit films as the lead hero from 1969 to 1971 which included 15 solo hero films and 2 non-solo hero films Andaz and Maryada. Khanna considered Guru Dutt, Meena Kumari and Geeta Bali to be his idols. Khanna said in an interview: \"My inspirations include, Dilip Kumar's dedication and intensity, Raj Kapoor's spontaneity, Dev Anand's style and Shammi Kapoor's rhythm.\" Between 1976 and 1978, Khanna acted in 5 box office hits and in nine films that were not commercially successful. Seven of the unsuccessful films were critically acclaimed and have achieved strong cult status over the years among the viewers and these films included Mehbooba, Bundal Baaz, Tyaag, Palkon Ki Chhaon Mein, Naukri, Chakravyuha and Janta Hawaldar which were directed by Shakti Samanta, Shammi Kapoor, Din Dayal Sharma, Meraj, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Basu Chatterjee and Mehmood Ali, respectively. Khanna persuaded Samanta to cast his sister-in-law Simple Kapadia opposite him in Anurodh. Films starring Rajesh Khanna and directed by Shakti Samanta tended to be commercially successful, but Mehbooba was an exception. The change from romantic and social movies to action oriented multi-starrers caused the decline of Khanna's career in terms of box office ratings to some extent. The declaration of emergency in India had angered the masses and this helped films having the lead character revolting against corruption becoming successes. Actor Joy Mukherjee made Chhailla Babu, a suspense thriller in 1977, which became the only successful film of his as a director and the unexpected success of Chhailla Babu gave a boost to the career of Khanna. However, Khanna continued basically in solo hero social sober household meaningful films during this era and played a variety of characters in films of various genres. During this phase too he had box office hits like Maha Chor, Chhailla Babu, Anurodh, Karm, Tinku and Bhola Bhala. Khanna was the first choice of director Raj Kapoor for the lead role in Satyam Shivam Sundaram however Rishi Kapoor due to his boyish resentments and since few members from Raj Kapoor camp vehemently opposed Khanna being the lead, role went to Shashi Kapoor. However Raj Kapoor was determined to work with Khanna hence co-starred in Naukri. After 1978, Khanna starred in critically acclaimed commercially successful films such as Amar Deep, Phir Wohi Raat, Bandish, Thodisi Bewafaii, Dard, Kudrat, Dhanwan, Ashanti (1982 film), Avtaar, Agar Tum Na Hote, Souten, Jaanwar, Asha Jyoti, Awaaz, Naya Kadam, Hum Dono, Babu, Aaj Ka M.L.A. Ram Avtar, Shatru, Insaaf Main Karoonga, Anokha Rishta, Nazrana, Angaarey, Adhikar, Amrit, Awam, Rupaye Dus Karod (from 1979 to 1991). Director Bharathiraja decided to remake his 1978 Tamil box office hit film \"Sigappu Rojakkal\" in Hindi with Khanna playing the role of a psychopath. Kamal Haasan who played the same role in Tamil won South Filmfare Best Actor Award for his portrayal. But the Hindi movie was seen as controversial by traditional and orthodox Hindi moviegoers and was not a commercial success, although Khanna's performance has been rated later higher by critics than the original. Tina Munim and Rajesh Khanna became the leading on and off screen couple of the 80\u2019s with hits like Fiffty Fiffty, Suraag \u2013 The Clue, Souten, Aakhir Kyun, Bewafai, Insaaf Main Karoonga and Adhikar. Ram Awatar Agnihotri wrote that Tina Munim showed the first sparks of the dedicated actress she would become in the films \"Alag Alag\" and \"Adhikar\", both with Khanna. His on screen pair with Shabana Azmi, Smita Patil, Padmini Kolhapure and Poonam Dhillon was also popular in the eighties He also acted in the Marathi hit film \"Sundara Satarkar\" in 1981. Kamal Hasan was close friend of Khanna and Kamal quoted in an interview \"He probably hadn\u2019t been to a public theatre since he became a star. When we reached things were okay. He enjoyed the mediocre film (The Swarm) thoroughly and refused to leave until the end titles. That\u2019s when I panicked. This was Rajesh Khanna, the star of the millennium. If audiences got to know he was present there would be a stampede and blood on my hands. But Mr Khanna refused to listen. He stayed on till the end. The inevitable happened after the show. All hell broke loose as audiences realised he was there. I became the Rajesh Khanna\u2019s bodyguard and security officer as I took him through the crowd. His shirt was torn. But he was enjoying himself thoroughly. He giggled and chuckled like a child.\" Khanna starred in remake of 3 films of Kamal and in return Kamal acted in 2 remake of Khanna's films. Khanna performed in successful multi-star films including Rajput, Dharm Aur Qanoon, Paapi Pet Ka Sawaal Hai, Zamana, Dil-E-Nadaan and Ghar Ka Chiraag. He did three movies with Jeetendra: Dharam Kanta, Nishaan and Maqsad. In 1984, Maqsad was the second-highest ranked film in terms of box office results, earning 8.5\u00a0crores. In Aaj Ka M.L.A. Ram Avtar, Khanna played the character of a corrupt politician. Viewers praised his role in the film. In 1985 he produced Alag Alag. As per Guardian UK, he had 11 releases as solo lead hero in the year 1985 and eight of them were hits. In 1985, the film Bewafai, with Khanna as the lead hero and Rajnikanth in negative role, released and became asuccess and grossed Rs 11.95\u00a0crore at the box office that year. Before joining politics, one of his last films as the lead hero was Swarg released in 1990. David Dhawan regards Swarg as his favourite directorial venture. He worked in films of different genres: tragedy in Babu as a rickshaw puller, thriller in Redrose as a psycopath, political adventure in Awam, fantasy in Bundalbaaz and Jaanwar, crime in Phir Wohi Raat and Angarey, suspense in Chakravyuha and Iteefaq, comedy in Joru Ka Ghulam, Bawarchi, Hum Dono and Masterji, action in Ashanti and Zamana, and family dramas addressing different issues in Aanchal, Amrit and Agar Tum Na Hote and films addressing issues of social concerns Avtaar, Naya Kadam, Akhir Kyun.[citation needed] He did films of different themes like reincarnation theme in Kudrat, spiritualism in Maalik, immaturity while falling in love like in Anokha Rishta, Nazrana and Dil E Nadan. He played a variety of characters as the lead hero: a postman in Palkon Ki Chaon Mein, a lawyer who proves that his senior has committed a rape 25 years earlier in Kudrat, a politician in Aaj Ka MLA Ram Avtaar, a young musician forced by fate to marry two women in Asha Jyoti, a professional advocate in Awaaz, a fisherman in Prem Bandhan, a patriot in Prem Kahanai, as a righteous farmer in Bandhan and as a Muslim who falls in love with a prostitute's daughter in Mehboob Ki Mehendi.[citation needed] He shared a close relationship with R. D. Burman and Kishore Kumar. The trio were friends and have worked together in thirty two films. Kishore Kumar had even credited Rajesh Khanna for his resurgence, so much so that he sang for Alag Alag, the first film produced by Rajesh Khanna without charging anything. In 1985 Pancham found himself being sidelined after failure of few films but Rajesh Khanna was among the few who continued to stand by him. Rajesh and Pancham worked together even after the death of Kishore in the films Jai Shiv Shankar, the unreleased film Police Ke Peechhe Police (both produced by Khanna) and Sautela Bhai. Khanna even helped Leena Gangully and Amit Kumar in completing Mamta Ki Chhaon Mein, the last film directed by Kishore who died before the completion of the film. Pyarelal of Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo quoted in an interview that \"Rajesh Khanna was lucky for us and we were lucky for him too. From the 1969 Do Raaste to the 1986 Amrit, we gave hits together both as films and as music scores.... When we went on our first overseas concert tour in 1984, he came and danced to three songs. He was very particular about his music and would take a tape home if he could not assess a song. He would then give his feedback after a day or two. But if he liked a song at the sitting, he would loudly shout \"Wah! Wah!\" in appreciation\u2026. It was God\u2019s blessing that we came up with such a vast range of hit songs for him, including in his home productions Roti and films like Chhailla Babu, Chakravyuha, Fiffty Fiffty, Amar Deep and Anurodh. Incidentally, he had a stake in Mehboob Ki Mehndi too. He had great interest in music and a terrific sense of melody too. His music is dominated by Pancham (R.D. Burman) and us and we accepted Shakti Samanta\u2019s Anurodh only because Rajesh Khanna had some misunderstanding with Pancham then and did not want to work with him.\" Khanna would always request music directors to fit in Kishore Kumar wherever possible. In fact, Kishoreda was very reluctant to sing \"Waada Tera Waada\" in Dushman and suggested Laxmikant Pyarelal to get it sung by Rafi. Then Laxmikant made Kishoreda meet Rajesh Khanna and Khanna winked at Laxmikant and told Kishoreda that in that case the song should be scrapped. On hearing this Kishore immediately agreed to sing it by himself for Khanna. Actors who were part of the cast of most of his films include Ashok Kumar, Sujit Kumar, Prem Chopra, Madan Puri, Asrani, Bindu, Vijay Arora, Roopesh Kumar, Dina Pathak and A. K. Hangal, who remained part of his \" working team\" since the start until the late eighties. The lyricist whom he preferred for his movies was Anand Bakshi. Films by Shakti Samanta with Khanna in the lead, music by Pancham and lyrics by Anand Bakshi had people swooning over. The films Samanta directed without Khanna in the eighties were duds. His other close friends from the film industry include Raj Babbar, J. Om Prakash, Prem Chopra, D. Rama Naidu and Jeetendra. Celebrities of the post-2000 era, like Madhur Bhandarkar, say that they take at least three or four turns in Carter Road even today only to see Khanna. The younger generation stars like Imran Khan still regard Rajesh Khanna as someone who would take the top slot as the most romantic hero of all time. Shahrukh Khan idolises Rajesh Khanna and has opined,\"Rajesh Khanna you can\u2019t touch\". Anupam Kher said \"Kishore Kumar, Sanjeev Kumar, S. D. Burman, R. D. Burman, Rajesh Khanna, Smita Patil changed the face of Indian cinema. They\u2019re remembered by the films that they do.\" Actor Tom Alter confessed \"I still dream of being Rajesh Khanna. For me, in the early 1970s, he was the only hero \u2013 romantic to the core, not larger than life, so Indian and real \u2013 he was my hero; the reason I came into films and he still is.\" Actor Irrfan Khan stated in an interview, \"The kind of craze witnessed by Rajesh Khanna has not been duplicated by anyone. He was the biggest and the most real star Bollywood has produced. I'd say stardom is that feeling of being possessed by your idol; you are so overwhelmed with euphoria you lose touch with reality.\" The trend of wearing guru kurtas and belt on shirts became famous in seventies and eighties because of Khanna. Javed Akhthar told in an interview about his experience about Khanna's stardom \"Bangalore used to have a state lottery and the government asked him to draw the lucky number. They organised it in a stadium. I was with him as we were discussing some scripts. I don't know if I will experience that again, the sound of 50,000 people gasping (when they saw him). He was like Caesar. It was unbelievable\". From the early nineties, while serving as Congress M.P. from 1991 to 1996, he returned to acting, playing the lead in Khudai (1994), which was about a father and son both falling in love for the same woman. After 1992, he appeared in only 10 films and declined most film offers. He made a comeback as a NRI in Aa Ab Laut Chalen (1999), and Kyaa Dil Ne Kahaa (2002) and played the solo lead in films Sautela Bhai in 1996, Pyar Zindagi Hai in 2001, Kaash Mere Hote in 2009, Wafaa in 2008 and Riyasaat in 2014. He did 4 television serials in the period 2000\u20132009. Khanna was a life member of the International Film And Television Research Centre, the International Film And Television Club and the Asian Academy of Film & Television. He was the Guest Faculty of 'Specialised Cinema Courses At Asian School Of Media Studies'. On 10 April 1999 Khanna inaugurated the live concert of S.P. Balasubramanyam held at Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, Hyderabad as a tribute to Pancham. In 2001 and 2002, Rajesh played the lead in two television serials: Aapne Parai (B4U & DD Metro) and Ittefaq (Zee TV). He performed in a video album based on Tagore's songs (Rabindra Sangeet) without payment. He also endorsed Star se Superstar tak \u2013 a talent hunt programme in 2007 and donated a Gold Trophy of Rs.1\u00a0crore. In its Silver Jubilee Episode on 14\u201315 March 2008, K for Kishore aired a Rajesh Khanna special. He signed on to star in a TV serial with Creative Eye Banner (Dhiraj Kumar) in 2007, and in 2008 performed in a TV serial, Bhabhima, with Leena Ganguly as his co-star. His successful TV serial Raghukul Reet Sada Chali Aayi began in November 2008 and ended in September 2009. Khanna cited the lack of good roles for actors like him in the films as the reason for him not appearing much in films after 2001. He said in an interview on being queried about his decision to do TV serials, \"The reach of TV is much more than cinema today and one episode of my serial is likely to be watched by more people than a super-hit film\". In 2009, on his 67th birthday, Shemaroo Entertainment released his films and a song collection titled Screen Legends-Rajesh Khanna-the Original Superstar. In May 2012, Havells, the fan making company endorsed Khanna as Brand Ambassador for their new ad campaign featuring him in solo advertisements. At the insistence of Rajiv Gandhi, he started campaigning for Congress since 1984. In the election for New Delhi seat in the 1991 Lok Sabha election, Khanna lost to L.K. Advani by a narrow margin of 1589 votes after which Khanna stood on the ground at the counting station insisting that he had been cheated of a win. A by-election took place and Khanna won the same seat in 1992 by defeating Shatrughan Sinha by 25,000 votes. Rajesh Khanna was a member of Parliament for the Indian National Congress, from the New Delhi constituency, where he won the 1992 by-election, retaining his seat until the 1996 after which he was not interested in active politics. When Khanna was MP, he did not accept new acting assignements but only acted in the film Khudai (1994). After leaving parliament, he was a political activist for the INC and campaigned for the party till the 2012 Punjab election. Khanna and a group of foreign investors bought land in Shirdi on which they planned to build a religious resort for disciples of Sai Baba of Shirdi. During his career, Khanna played the lead in 74 films that were shown in cinemas for more than 50 continuous weeks, and 22 films that were shown for more than 25 but less than 50 weeks.[citation needed] In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Khanna fell in love with the then fashion designer and actress Anju Mahendru. They were in a relationship for seven years. Mahendru states that the couple did not speak to each other for 17 years after the break-up. Later Khanna married the budding actress Dimple Kapadia in March 1973, before Kapadia's debut film Bobby released in November of that year. They have two daughters from the marriage; Twinkle and Rinke. Khanna and Kapadia separated in 1984 but did not complete the divorce proceedings. In the 1980s Tina Munim was romantically involved with Khanna while working with Khanna in 11 movies from 1980 to 1987. Munim had been a fan of Rajesh since her school days. According to website Bollywood Mantra reporter, relation with Tina ended in 1987 when Khanna refused to marry her as their marriage would have bad impact on his daughters. Khanna and Kapadia however maintained an amicable relationship where they both were seen together at parties and family functions. Kapadia also campaigned for Khanna's election and worked in his film Jai Shiv Shankar (1990). Khanna's elder daughter Twinkle Khanna, an interior decorator and a former film actress, is married to actor Akshay Kumar while his younger daughter Rinke Khanna, also a former Hindi film actress, is married to a London-based investment banker Samir Saran. On 17 July 2012, a woman named Anita Advani claimed that she had been Khanna's live-in partner, and sent a legal notice to his family members asking for compensation. The family denied the claims. In June 2012, it was reported that Rajesh Khanna's health had been deteriorating for some time. On 23 June he was admitted to Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai due to health complications. He was discharged on 8 July from the hospital and was reportedly fine. On 14 July, Khanna was readmitted to the Lilavati Hospital but was discharged on 16 July. He died on 18 July 2012, at his bungalow, Aashirwad, in Mumbai. Sources confirmed that his health had been deteriorating since July 2011 as he was diagnosed with cancer. After his death his co-star Mumtaz said that Khanna was suffering from cancer for the duration of the prior year and had undergone chemotherapy sessions. His funeral took place on 19 July at 11:00. His funeral was attended by nearly 9\u00a0lakh people and his fans had come from places like Surat, Ahmedabad, California, Singapore and from other foreign countries.

He died in the presence of his wife Dimple Kapadia, daughters Rinkie Khanna and Twinkle Khanna, son-in-law Akshay Kumar, grand children, Anju Mahendru and other close relatives. His pyre was lit by his grandson, Aarav, with the assistance of Akshay Kumar.  Amitabh Bachchan cited that Khanna's last words were 'Time is up', 'Pack up'. In his special recorded message to his family, friends and fans which was played on his \"chautha\", he thanked and saluted his friends and fans for the love they showered on him. On 25 July 2012, his ashes were immersed in Ganges by his wife Dimple Kapadia and daughter Rinke Khanna. Following his death, there was a quick spate of reactions from within the Bollywood fraternity. The President of India Pratibha Patil condoled the passing away of the actor. In a press release she said \"I am saddened to learn about the passing away of Rajesh Khanna. In his prime as an actor he was the heartthrob of the young generation of 1970s, who tried to model themselves on him and his style.\" Other celebrities who paid homage to him at his house after his death included Manoj Kumar, Asha Parekh, Ranjeet, Jeetendra, Rakesh Roshan, Yash Chopra, Randhir Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor, Shabana Azmi, Dharmendra, Vinod Khanna, Asrani, Prem Chopra, Govinda Arun Ahuja Salman Khan, Shahrukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, and Sajid Khan.

Shahrukh Khan reacted by saying: \"To live with intention and walk to the edge. Play with abandon, choose with no regret. Smile and made us do the same. Sir, you defined our era. Whenever life felt tough u made us feel how love could change it all. RIP.\" Mumtaz also added that she had memories of having working with him and said she was crying the whole morning, but was happy that she had met the ailing Khanna in Mumbai in June 2012, when the two discussed their respective battles with cancer. While Shahid Kapoor quoted: \"RIP to the 1st king of romance\u00a0... Rajesh Khanna.\" Subhash Ghai added that Khanna \"was the powerhouse of Hindi film industry. I met him on the sets of Aradhna, he had some kind of energy and you will be charged when he is around you. His name will be written in golden words.\" Amitabh Bachchan was quoted as saying: \"The word 'superstar' was invented for him, and for me it shall ever remain his, and no others ..\u00a0!!His generation and the generations that follow, shall never be able to describe, or understand his phenomena ..\u00a0!!\". His son-in-law Akshay Kumar told reporters about his death and added that \"he has gone to a nice and heavenly place. I am happy that he has gone there and hope that everyone will pray for him.\" Vyjayanthimala commented that \"his death is a big loss to the industry. It's my bad luck that I didn't have the chance to work with him because he came much later. I remember when he came to Chennai for some film shoot the college girls went crazy to catch a glimpse of him when he was going to his studio.\" Manna Dey said: \"He was a great actor, truly a superstar no doubt about it. I am honoured to have done playback for him. I have worked for him in several movies and actors like him are a rarity.\" Mrinal Sen recollected how Khanna had wanted to cast him in one of his films, but the latter could not manage due to date problems. \"We had met several times. Once I had wanted to cast him in one of my films but somehow that didn't work out due to his date problems.\" Buddhadeb Dasgupta said Khanna's acting would continue to inspire young actors in future. \"He was a great actor and was the first superstar. He was a much bigger star than Amitabh Bachchan. His acting will continue to inspire young actors of the coming generations.\" Rituparno Ghosh said: \"In the film 'Anand', Khanna delivered some of Indian cinema's most memorable dialogues. The use of the word 'babu moshai' for Amitabh Bachchan, who played a Bengali doctor in the film, is so deeply etched in the minds of Indians that it has almost become a synonym for Bengalis for the rest of the countrymen. \"In a dhoti and kurta, you showed the rest of India how truly elegant Bengal was\" Madhur Bhandarkar said, \"The epitome of superstardom is no more amongst us. There was none, there is none and there won't be any like you kakaji.\" Film historian S. M. M. Ausaja added: \"He never acted in a Bengali cinema. But right from the late 1960s to the 70s he was the top star and worked with the top directors of his era, most of whom were Bengalis.\" There were also reactions from the Gali Tiwaria where the his ancestral house was, and had since been converted to a temple through his donation. Songs from his movies were played as the news of his death became known. His foster brother Muni Chand Khanna said that \"he used to love to play cricket when he lived here. He was a simple boy when he lived here and led a simple life even after achieving so much.\" As were the residents of Burewala, Pakistan. Additionally, those within the political spectrum that offered their condolences included Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who said that he \"convey[s] my heartfelt condolences to the members of the bereaved family and countless fans and admirers of Shri Rajesh Khanna.\" INC President Sonia Gandhi also expressed her sorrow. Regional political leaders who offered their condolences included Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee who said: \"Rajesh Khanna was always a symbol of romance. His smiling face and the ability to connect with people at ease had made him popular. We lost a big pole star in the film world today;\" as well as Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who added that \"his death has caused irreparable loss to Hindi cinema.\" Condolences also came from Pakistan where Prime Minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf called Khanna a \"great actor whose contribution to the field of films and arts would be long remembered. [He had a] large fan following across the borders and captivated audiences with his excellent acting skills.\" Ali Zafar wrote on Twitter: \"Rajesh Khanna \u2013 RIP. So many fond memories from his movies and songs,\" while Syed Noor said: \"Rajesh Khanna was such a huge actor of the subcontinent that he will be remembered by the people for many years to come. The era he reigned over is unlikely to be experienced by any other actor of this subcontinent.\" Geo TV also aired a nearly hour-long tribute with contributions from actors, filmmakers and musicians.

        "artist_name": "Rajinikanth", 
        "biography": " Shivaji Rao Gaekwad (born 12 December 1950), known by his mononymous stage name Rajinikanth, is an Indian film actor who works primarily in Tamil cinema. He began acting in plays while working in the Bangalore Transport Service as a bus conductor. In 1973, he joined the Madras Film Institute to pursue a diploma in acting. Following his debut in K. Balachander's Tamil drama Apoorva Raagangal (1975), his acting career commenced with a brief phase of portraying antagonistic characters in Tamil films. After earning \u20b926 crore (equivalent to \u20b955\u00a0crore or US$8.5\u00a0million in 2016) for his role in Sivaji (2007), he was the highest paid actor in Asia after Jackie Chan at the time. While working in other regional film industries of India, Rajinikanth has also appeared in the cinemas of other nations, including the American film Bloodstone (1988). As of 2014, Rajinikanth has won six Tamil Nadu State Film Awards\u2014four Best Actor Awards and two Special Awards for Best Actor\u2014and a Filmfare Best Tamil Actor Award. In addition to acting, he has also worked as a producer and screenwriter. Apart from his film career, he is also a philanthropist, spiritualist, and serves as an influence in Dravidian politics. The Government of India has honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2016 for his contributions to the arts. At the 45th International Film Festival of India (2014), he was conferred with the \"Centenary Award for Indian Film Personality of the Year\".   Rajinikanth was born on 12 December 1950, in a Maratha family in Bangalore, Mysore State (present day Karnataka). His mother was a housewife,[a] and his father Ramoji Rao Gaekwad, a police constable, He was named Shivaji Rao Gaekwad after Chhatrapati Shivaji, a Maratha warrior King, and was brought up speaking Marathi at home and Kannada outside. Rajinikanth's ancestors hailed from a village called Mavdi Kade Pathar, in the present-day Pune district, Maharashtra. He is the youngest of four siblings in a family consisting of two elder brothers, Satyanarayana Rao & Nageshwara Rao and a sister, Aswath Balubhai. After his father's retirement from work in 1956, the family moved to the suburb of Hanumantha nagar in Bangalore and built a house there. When he was nine years old, he lost his mother. At the age of six, Rajinikanth was enrolled at the \"Gavipuram Government Kannada Model Primary School\" where he had his primary education. As a child, he was studious and \"mischievous\" with a great interest in cricket, football and basketball. It was during this time his brother enrolled him at the Ramakrishna Math, a Hindu monastery set up by Ramakrishna Mission. In the math, he was taught Vedas, tradition and history which eventually instilled a sense of spirituality in him. In addition to spiritual lessons, he also began acting in plays at the math. His aspiration towards theatre grew at the math and was once given an opportunity to enact the role of Ekalavya's friend from the Hindu epic Mahabharata. His performance in the play received praise from the audience and Kannada poet D. R. Bendre in particular. After sixth grade, Rajinikanth was enrolled at the Acharya Pathasala Public School and studied there till completion of his pre-university course. During his schooling at the Acharya Pathasala, he spent a lot of time acting in plays. In one such occasion, he performed villainous role Duryodhana in the play Kurukshetra. Upon completion of his school education, Rajinikanth continued to perform various jobs in the cities of Bangalore and Madras, including that of a coolie and carpenter, and finally ended up being recruited in the Bangalore Transport Service (BTS) as a bus conductor. He began to take part in stage plays after Kannada playwright Topi Muniappa offered him a chance to act in one of his mythological plays. During the time, he came across an advertisement issued by the newly formed Madras Film Institute which offered acting courses. Though his family was not fully supportive of his decision to join the institute, his friend and co-worker Raj Bahadur motivated him to join the institute and financially supported him during this phase. During his stay at the institute, he was performing in a stage play and got noticed by Tamil film director K. Balachander. The director advised him to learn to speak Tamil, a recommendation that Rajinikanth quickly followed. \"Rajinikanth claims that I am his school. But I must admit that this wasn't the Rajinikanth I introduced. He has evolved on his own merits and strengths. I gave him an opportunity and unveiled him to the world. He went and conquered it.\" Rajinikanth began his film career through the Tamil film Apoorva Raagangal (1975). Balachander gave Rajinikanth a relatively small role as an abusive husband of Srividya. The film was controversial upon release as it explored relationships between people with wide age differences. It received wide critical acclaim as it went on to win three National Film Awards including the award for the Best Tamil Feature at the following year ceremony. A review from The Hindu noted that, \"Newcomer Rajinikanth is dignified and impressive\". He followed that with Katha Sangama (January,1975), an experimental film made by Puttanna Kanagal in the new wave style. The film was a portmanteau of three short stories had Rajinikanth playing a small character in the last segment where he appears as a village ruffian who rapes a blind woman in the absence of her husband. His next release was Anthuleni Katha, a Telugu film directed by Balachander. A remake of his own Tamil film Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), Balachander had Rajinikanth playing a pivotal role for the first time in his career. In the subsequent films, he continued to perform a series of negative roles mostly as a womaniser. In Moondru Mudichu\u2014the first film to feature him in a prominent role\u2014he plays a character that \"blithely row[s] away\" when his friend drowns accidentally into the lake only to fulfill his desire to marry the former's girlfriend. His style of flipping the cigarette made him popular among the audience. His final release of 1976, Baalu Jenu, yet again saw him performing a role which troubles the female lead. He followed that with similar roles in Avargal, and 16 Vayadhinile. In 1977, he accepted his first-ever lead role in the Telugu film Chilakamma Cheppindi. Though Rajinikanth always refers to K. Balachander as his mentor, it was S. P. Muthuraman who revamped his image. Muthuraman first experimented with him in a positive role in Bhuvana Oru Kelvikkuri (1977), as a failed lover in the first half of the film and a protagonist in the second half. The success of the film brought the duo together for 24 more films till the 1990s. The year saw Rajinikanth playing supporting roles in majority of the films with few of them being \"villainous\". In Gayathri, he was cast as pornographer who secretly films his relationship with his wife without her knowledge, while in Galate Samsara, he played the role of a married man who develops an affair with a cabaret dancer. All in all, he had 15 of his films released during the year, much higher than the previous years. In 1978, Rajinikanth went on to star in 20 different films in Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada. His first film of the year was P. Madhavan's Shankar Salim Simon. Following that he was seen in the Kannada film Kiladi Kittu, co-starring Vishnuvardhan, who was then a leading actor in Kannada. His next release, Annadammula Savaal, saw him playing the second lead with Krishna. Rajinikanth reprised his role in the Kannada original. He then played an important role in Aayiram Jenmangal, which was touted as a supernatural thriller. Next, he played a prime antagonist in Maathu Tappada Maga, his 25th release. Bairavi, directed by M.Bhaskar and released in the same year, was the first Tamil film to cast Rajinikanth as a main hero. It was for this film that he earned the sobriquet \"Superstar\". S. Thanu, one of the film's distributors, set up a cut-out of Rajinikanth over 35 feet (11\u00a0m) high. His next appearance Ilamai Oonjal Aadukirathu, a quadrangular love story written by C. V. Sridhar, saw him in the role of a man who sacrifices his love for his friend, played by Kamal Haasan. The film's success prompted Sridhar to remake the film in Telugu, directing Vayasu Pilichindi, which retained the original cast of the Tamil film. His next film, Vanakkatukuriya Kathaliye, has an introductory song to mark his entry, a trend that would soon catch on in with his later films. Mullum Malarum, released during the same period, received critical acclaim. The film marked the directional debut of J. Mahendran, with a screenplay adapted from a novel of the same name published in Kalki. It eventually won the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Film and a special prize for Rajinikanth as Best Actor at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. Following this, he made a foray into Malayalam cinema through the fantasy film Allauddinum Albhutha Vilakkum, based on a story from the Arabian Nights. The same year, he acted in Dharma Yuddam, in which he played a mentally ill person taking revenge for his parents' deaths. He then co-starred with N. T. Rama Rao in Tiger. With the completion of Tiger, Rajinikanth had acted in 50 films over a period of four years and in four languages. Some other popular films released during this period are the youthful entertainer Ninaithale Inikkum, the Tamil\u2013Kannada bilingual Priya, the Telugu film Amma Evarikkaina Amma and the melodrama Aarilirunthu Arubathu Varai. Priya, based on a detective novel by Sujatha Rangarajan, had the distinction of being the first film of Rajinikanth to be shot mostly outside India, mainly in Southeast Asia. By 1980 he was a popular actor in the South Indian cinema. During this phase of his career, Rajinikanth abruptly chose to quit acting, but was coaxed to return with the Tamil film Billa, a remake of the Bollywood film Don (1978). It had Rajinikanth playing dual roles and eventually became his first ever commercial success. His pairing with Sridevi continued in Johnny where he was once again cast in a double role. He also starred in Murattu Kaalai which was a commercial success. In 1981, he appeared in Garjanai which was shot simultaneously in Kannada and Malayalam, making it his last film in those two languages to date.[when?] In K. Balachander's first home production, Netrikan, he played dual roles as a womanising father and a responsible son. His first full-length comedy was Thillu Mullu directed by K. Balachander. He agreed to it solely due to the strong suggestion by his mentor that he should do non-commercial roles, to break the stereotyped action-hero mould by which he was getting famous at the time. 1981 also saw the release of Thee, the remake of Amitabh Bachchan's 1975 blockbuster Deewar, in which Rajinikanth reprised the role of Bachchan in the original. In 1982, he starred in Pokkiri Raja, Moondru Mugam, Thanikattu Raja, Puthukavithai and Enkeyo Ketta Kural. Moondru Mugam had Rajinikanth playing three roles for the first time. In 1983, he starred in his first Bollywood film, Andha Kanoon, alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini. The film went on to become one of the highest-grossing films of that time. His 1984 film, Naan Mahaan Alla, was directed by Muturaman and produced by K. Balachander. He acted in his first cameo role in the film Anbulla Rajinikanth. He played a triple role in John Jani Janardhan. His performance in Nallavanuku Nallavan earned him a Filmfare Best Tamil Actor Award. In his 100th film, Sri Raghavendra (1985), he played the Hindu saint Raghavendra Swami. His greatest success in Hindi films was his 101st film, Bewafai. Released in 1985 with Rajesh Khanna as the lead hero and Rajnikanth as villain, it became a success and grossed Rs 11.95\u00a0crore at the box office that year. In the second half of the 1980s, Rajinikanth acted in commercially successful films like Naan Sigappu Manithan (1985), Padikkathavan (1985), Mr. Bharath (1986), Velaikaran (1987), Guru Sishyan (1988) and Dharmathin Thalaivan (1988). In 1988, he made his only American film appearance in Bloodstone, directed by Dwight Little, in which he played an English-speaking Indian taxi driver. Rajinikanth finished the decade with films including Rajadhi Raja, Siva, Raja Chinna Roja and Mappillai while also starring in a few Bollywood productions. Raja Chinna Roja was the first Indian film to feature live action and animation. By the 1990s, Rajinikanth established himself as a commercial entertainer. Almost all the films released during this period were highly successful at the box office. He began the decade with a blockbuster in Panakkaran (1990), which was a remake of Amitabh Bachchan's 1981 film Laawaris. His next two Tamil films, the fantasy comedy Athisaya Piravi (a remake of Chiranjeevi's 1988 film Yamudiki Mogudu) which also released in 1990 and the family drama Dharmadorai (1991), did above-average business at the box office. His stint with Bollywood continued since the past decade as he went on to star in more Hindi films. Hum released in 1991 saw him doing the second main lead with Amitabh Bachchan became an inspiration for Badsha. In 1991, he worked with Mani Ratnam in Thalapathi, which was heavily inspired by the Mahabharata. in which he co-starred with actor Mammooty; the film dealt with the friendship between two unknown characters based on Karna and Duryodhana, respectively, and was set in a more contemporary milieu and was both critically acclaimed and successful upon release. He went on to appear in remakes of films from other languages, mostly from Hindi and Telugu. Annamalai, which released in 1992, was yet another friendship centric film and was loosely based on the 1987 Bollywood film Khudgarz. Mannan, directed by P. Vasu and a remake of Kannada actor Rajkumar's 1986 blockbuster Anuraga Aralithu, also released in 1992 and became a box-office success. Rajinikanth wrote his first screenplay for the film Valli (1993), in which he also made a special appearance. He also starred in the film Yejaman, in which he played the role of Vaanavaraayan, a village chieftain. His romantic-comedy Veera (1994) was controversial for its climax but went on to become one of the highest-grossing films in 1994. He joined hands with Suresh Krishna for Baashha (1995), which emerged as an industry record, and is routinely touted by fans and critics alike as a major-hit, as the film elevated him from being just another very popular actor to nearly a demigod status among the masses. He made a cameo in Peddarayudu for his friend Mohan Babu and also helped him in obtaining the remake rights. The same year, he acted in yet another gangster film, Aatank Hi Aatank with Aamir Khan which was also his last Hindi film in a major role till date. His film Muthu, a remake of Mohanlal's blockbuster Malayalam movie Thenmavin Kombathu, was another commercial success, directed by K. S. Ravikumar and produced by K. Balachander, and became the first Tamil film to be dubbed into Japanese, as Mutu: Odoru Maharaja. The film grossed a record US$1.6\u00a0million in Japan in 1998 and was responsible for creating a large Japanese fan-base for the actor. Muthu's success in Japan led American news magazine Newsweek to comment in a 1999 article that Rajinikanth had \"supplanted Leonardo DiCaprio as Japan's trendiest heartthrob\". During a visit to Japan in 2006, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh acknowledged the success of Muthu in the country during a speech, justifying the positive relationship between the two nations. He also entered Bengali cinema through Bhagya Debata, which released at the end of 1995. 1997's Arunachalam was another commercial success. Rajinikanth released his last film of the millennium with Padayappa (1999) which went on to become a blockbuster success. It starred Ramya Krishnan and Soundarya The former critically acclaimed for her performance. It was also the last, prominent role for veteran Tamil actor Sivaji Ganesan. After a brief gap, Rajinikanth starred in Baba in 2002, for which he had also written the screenplay. Released with much fanfare and hype at the time, the film featured a story revolving around the reforming of a gangster, who is revealed to be the reincarnation of the Hindu saint Mahavatar Babaji, and fights against political corruption. It fell short of market expectations and the high bids reportedly translated to heavy losses for the distributors. Rajinikanth himself repaid the losses incurred by the distributors. The film was received with comments such as \"the bloom was off the rose\" and that \"the gold does not glitter any more\". Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) leader S. Ramadoss condemned him for smoking and posing with beedis in the film. He was criticised for spoiling the Tamil youth by glorifying smoking and drinking. PMK volunteers attacked the theatres which screened the film and usurped film rolls and burnt it. Two years later, Rajinikanth signed up for P. Vasu's Chandramukhi (2005), a remake of the Malayalam film Manichitrathazhu. Upon release the film was highly successful at the box-office, and in 2007 it set the record of being the longest running Tamil film. Chandramukhi was also dubbed in Turkish and German as Der Geisterj\u00e4ger and released in the respective nations. Following Chandramukhi's release, it was reported that AVM Productions were set to produce a film directed by Shankar starring Rajinikanth\u2014the largest collaboration yet for a Tamil film. The film was titled Sivaji and released in the summer of 2007, following two years of filming and production. It became the first Tamil film to be charted as one of the \"top-ten best films\" of the United Kingdom and South Africa box-offices upon release. Rajinikanth received a salary of \u20b926 crore (equivalent to \u20b955\u00a0crore or US$8.5\u00a0million in 2016), for his role in the film, which made him the second highest paid actor in Asia after Jackie Chan. During the production of Sivaji, Soundarya Rajinikanth announced her intention of producing a computer-generated imagery film starring an animated version of her father titled Sultan: The Warrior. The film was set for release in 2008, however it entered development hell and its development status would become unknown over the next few years. \"Is there anything left to be said about a man who, at 61, still manages to star in one of the most successful films of the year, not just in the south, but across India? Superstar Rajni once again proved that he is the actor with the Midas touch with the sci-fi flick Endhiran, where he played an ambitious scientist, a naive robot and an evil android bent on destroying the world [...] He did it with such aplomb that he's been the talk of the town for months. He might do one film in two years, but when he does, he pulls out all the stops.\" He worked with P. Vasu again for Kuselan, remake of the Malayalam film Kadha Parayumbol which was made simultaneously in Telugu as Kathanayakudu, in which Rajinikanth played an extended cameo role as himself, a film star in the Indian cinema, and as a best friend to the film's protagonist. According to Rajinikanth, the film somewhat narrated his early life. The film, however, performed poorly at box offices and led to many distributors incurring major losses. Rajinikanth also stated that he would work with Pyramid Saimira again to compensate for Kuselan. Rajinikanth worked again with Shankar for the science fiction film, Enthiran. The film was released worldwide in 2010 as the most expensive Indian film ever made, ultimately becoming the second highest-grossing film in India of its time. Rajinikanth was paid a remuneration of \u20b945 crore (equivalent to \u20b971\u00a0crore or US$11\u00a0million in 2016) for the film. The film's success lead to the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad to use the film as a case study to analyse the business of cinema and its success story in a post-graduate elective management course called Contemporary Film Industry: A Business Perspective. The course would also study Muthu. In January 2011, Rajinikanth was slated to appear in Rana, a period film to be produced by Soundarya Rajinikanth and directed by K. S. Ravikumar, who would work with the actor for a third time. During the principal photography of the film on 29 April 2011, he suffered a mild foodborne illness on the sets, which led to vomiting, dehydration, and exhaustion. He was treated at St. Isabel's Hospital for a day before being discharged. Five days later, he was rushed to the same hospital again after suffering from breathlessness and fever. He was diagnosed with bronchitis and was kept at the hospital for a week, while also spending a few days in an intensive care unit. Several conflicting reports of discharge dates arose, as well as claims of Rajinikanth's health deteriorating, Two days after his last discharge, Rajinikanth was admitted to the Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute on 16 May 2011 for recurring respiratory and gastrointestinal problems. The hospital maintained that Rajinikanth was in stable condition and showed positive response to treatment. It was widely reported that he required a kidney transplantation, which was later denied by Dhanush. On 21 May 2011, Aishwarya Rajinikanth released a photo of her and Rajinikanth in his hospital ward, both posing with a thumbs signal, responding to fans' negative reaction to news reports. The hospital restricted unauthorised visitors. Rajinikanth's brother, Sathyanarayana Rao Gaikwad, reported that the cause of the sudden illness was due to stress from rapid weight-loss and changes in diet, as well as withdrawal of alcohol consumption and smoking cessation. After addressing fans in a 4-minute digitally recorded voice message to the media, Rajinikanth, under the advice of Amitabh Bachchan, travelled from Chennai to Singapore with his family on 21 May 2011, where he was to undergo further treatment for nephropathy at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. After spending over two weeks at the hospital, he was finally discharged on 15 June 2011 and continued to recuperate in Singapore, before returning to Chennai on 13 July 2011. Despite several failed attempts to restart Rana upon his return, Rajinikanth reprised his Enthiran character, Chitti, in the Bollywood science-fiction film Ra.One (2011) in a guest appearance alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor. In November 2011, it was decided that Rana would be shelved in favour of a new project with Rajinikanth, titled Kochadaiiyaan. The motion capture film, which is the first of its kind in India, was released in 2014 to positive reviews. Kochadaiiyaan, and the 3D release of Sivaji in 2012, made Rajinikanth the first Indian actor to have appeared in four different forms of cinema: black-and-white, colour, 3D and motion capture. Following the completion of Kochadaiiyaan, Rajinikanth began work in Ravikumar's next directorial venture, titled Lingaa alongside Anushka Shetty and Sonakshi Sinha. The film was released on 12 December 2014, coinciding with his birthday, and received mixed reviews from critics. Rajinikanth's next film was director Pa. Ranjith's crime drama Kabali, produced by S. Thanu. The film was released in July 2016. Rajinikanth is filming for 2.0, a spiritual successor to Enthiran, that is scheduled for release in 2017. In August 2016, it was announced that he would work with Ranjith again for a new film produced by Dhanush. Rajinikanth has often been referred to as the most popular film actor in South India by the media and audiences. In 2015, a film about his fandom, For the Love of a Man, premiered at the 71st Venice International Film Festival. His popularity has been attributed to \"his uniquely styled dialogues and idiosyncrasies in films, as well as his political statements and philanthropy\". Many also cite reasons for Rajinikanth's popularity as coming from his larger-than-life super-hero appearance in many films, supported by gravity-defying stunts and charismatic expressions, all while attempting to maintain modesty in real-life. Almost every film of Rajinikanth has punchlines delivered by him in an inimitable style, and these punchlines often have a message or even to warn the film's antagonists. These dialogues are usually fabricated to create new ones or even taken in a comical way, but do not fail to create a sense of entertainment among viewers. It is suggested by the media that actresses such as Gouthami and Nayanthara got their initial breakthrough after co-starring with Rajinikanth very early in their careers, giving other aspiring actors the urge to work with him. Rajinikanth is also the only Indian actor to be featured in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus, in a lesson titled From Bus Conductor to Superstar. After opening his first official Twitter account in 2014, Rajinikanth received over 210,000 followers within 24-hours, which according to The Economic Times was deemed by social media research firms as the fastest rate of followers for any Indian celebrity, as well as among the top-10 in the world. Much like Chuck Norris facts, \"Rajinikanth facts\" or \"Rajinikanth jokes\" are widely circulated in text messages and memes over the Internet. These satirical jokes have also inspired several mobile applications for iOS and Android. Critics, such as Cho Ramaswamy, have commented that Rajinikanth has the potential to be successful in Indian politics due to his popularity and fan base alone. In 1995, Rajinikanth began supporting the Indian National Congress after meeting Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao. An opinion poll conducted by the magazine Kumudam predicted that Congress with Rajinikanth's support might win up to 130 seats in Tamil Nadu Assembly. In 1996, when the Congress Party decided to align with All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) for the assembly election in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth changed loyalties and supported Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) alliance. The TMC used a bicycle as their election symbol and used an image of Rajinikanth riding a bicycle from the film Annamalai in their posters. Rajinikanth said, \"Even God cannot save Tamil Nadu if AIADMK returns to power.\" Rajinikanth wholeheartedly supported the DMK and TMC alliance and asked the people of Tamil Nadu and his fans to vote for that alliance. This alliance had a complete victory in 1996. Rajinikanth also supported the DMK-TMC alliance in the parliamentary election held the same year. Later in 2004, Rajinikanth said he would personally vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but would not extend his support to any front during the upcoming Indian general election. The party however failed to win any seats in Tamil Nadu in the Lok Sabha. Fans of Rajinikanth in Tamil Nadu have continuously speculated his entry in politics, particularly to run for Chief Minister of the state. In 2008, a few fans in Coimbatore launched a political party for Rajinikanth, in an attempt to pressure his entry. The party was named the \"Desiya Dravadar Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam\", with a dedicated party flag and symbol. After learning about this, Rajinikanth submitted an open letter to the media, declaring that he had no connection with these events and requested fans not to indulge in such activities, warning that he would take legal action if they failed to adhere. He also mentioned that he was not interested in politics and thus was only committed to working in films. He added that nobody can force him to enter politics, just as no one can stop him from entering it. Rajinikanth married Latha Rangachari, a student of Ethiraj College for Women, who interviewed him for her college magazine. The marriage took place on 26 February 1981, in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh. The couple have two daughters named Aishwarya Rajinikanth and Soundarya Rajinikanth. Latha runs a school named \"The Ashram\". Aishwarya married actor Dhanush on 18 November 2004 and they have two sons, Yathra and Linga. His younger daughter, Soundarya, works in the Tamil film industry as a director, producer and graphic designer. She married industrialist Ashwin Ramkumar on 3 September 2010 and have a son Ved Krishna. Rajinikanth is a follower of Hinduism, spiritualism, and a strong believer of spirituality. He is also a practitioner of yoga and meditation. Rajinikanth has religiously visited major Hindu temples prior to the release of each of his films; for instance he visited the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple before the release of Sivaji in 2007 and visited Sathya Sai Baba at Prasanthi Nilayam in Andhra Pradesh before the release of Kuselan the following year. He also occasionally leaves for pilgrimage to the Himalayas. He has often referred to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Swami Satchidananda, Ragavendra Swami, Mahavatar Babaji, and Ramana Maharishi as his favourite spiritual leaders. In 2002, Rajinikanth undertook a daylong fast to protest the Government of Karnataka's decision to not release Kaveri River water into Tamil Nadu and announced that he would contribute \u20b910 million (US$150,000) toward a plan to interlink Indian rivers. He met with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and many experts to canvass support for the project. His hunger strike was independent of the Nadigar Sangam, who organised their own solidarity protest for the same cause. Film director Bharathi Raja lashed out against Rajinikanth, alleging him of dividing the film industry and saying that he was a \"traitor who had a tacit understanding with the Karnataka government\". In 2008, Rajinikanth took part in a hunger strike organised by the Nadigar Sangam against Karnataka's stance on the Hogenakkal Falls water dispute. In his speech, which was well received in Tamil Nadu, he warned leaders not to inflame the water project issue for political gains and requested that the issue should be resolved soon. He reprimanded politicians in Karnataka and urged them \"to speak the truth\" to the public. \"They cannot be fooled and will not remain silent if you continue to act in such manner,\" he stated. The speech led to Vatal Nagaraj, leader of the Kannada nationalist group Kannada Chaluvali Vatal Paksha, demanding an apology from Rajinikanth and threatening that he and his films would be boycotted from the state of Karnataka. The threats were echoed by other pro-Kannada organisations, such as the Karnataka Rakshana Vedike.He later thanked the Kannada film industry for allowing the release of Kuselan and lifting the ban the industry had briefly imposed on it. This led to strong reactions from Nadigar Sangam members R. Sarathkumar, Sathyaraj and Radha Ravi, who called the apology a disgrace to Tamils and opined that his speech never provoked the sentiments of the Kannada people. Rajinikanth's support toward fellow actor Ajith Kumar, who in 2010 condemned the forceful inclusion of Tamil cinema personae in political affairs, broke into a controversy. According to Naman Ramachandran, the author of Rajinikanth: The Definitive Biography, most of Rajinikanth's philanthropic activities went unpublicised because he did not want them to be so. In the 1980s, when superstitious beliefs prevented a majority of people from donating eyes, Rajinikanth took the case of campaigning in support of corneal transplantation via television and public speeches. In 2011, Rajinikanth announced his support for the anti-corruption movement led by Gandhian Anna Hazare and offered his marriage hall, the Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam, in Chennai free of cost for the India Against Corruption members to hold their fast. Rajinikanth's fan associations regularly organise blood donation and eye donation camps and distribute food during his birthday. Rajinikanth has received numerous awards for many of his films mostly in Tamil. He received his first Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor in 1984 for Nallavanuku Nallavan. Later he received Filmfare Award nominations for his performances in Sivaji (2007) and Enthiran (2010). As of 2014, Rajinikanth has received six Tamil Nadu State Film Awards for his performances in various films. He also received numerous awards from Cinema Express and Filmfans' Association for his on-screen performances and off-screen contributions in writing and producing. Rajinikanth received the Kalaimamani award in 1984 and the M. G. R. Award in 1989, both from the Government of Tamil Nadu. In 1995, the South Indian Film Artistes' Association presented him with the Kalaichelvam Award. He was honoured with the Padma Bhushan (2000) and the Padma Vibhushan (2016) by the Government of India. He was selected as the Indian Entertainer of the Year for 2007 by NDTV, competing against the likes of Shahrukh Khan. The Government of Maharashtra honoured him with the Raj Kapoor Award the same year. He received the Chevalier Sivaji Ganesan Award for Excellence in Indian Cinema at the 4th Vijay Awards. Rajinikanth was also named one of the most influential persons in South Asia by Asiaweek. He was also named by Forbes India as the most influential Indian of the year 2010. In 2011, he was awarded the Entertainer of the Decade Award by NDTV for the year 2010 by the then Indian Minister for Home Affairs P. Chidambaram. In December 2013, he was honoured by NDTV as one among the \"25 Greatest Global Living Legends\". In 2014, he was presented with the \"Centenary Award for Indian Film Personality of the Year\" at the 45th International Film Festival of India held at Goa."

        "biography": " Ranbir Raj Kapoor (14 December 1924\u00a0\u2013 2 June 1988), also known as \"the greatest showman of Indian cinema\", was a noted Indian film actor, producer and director of Hindi cinema. Born at Kapoor Haveli in Peshawar to actor Prithviraj Kapoor\u2013he was a prominent member of the Kapoor family\u2013that produced several celebrated Bollywood superstars. Kapoor is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers and actors in the history of Indian cinema. He was the winner of several accolades including 3 National Film Awards and 11 Filmfare Awards in India. The Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award is named after Raj Kapoor. He was a two-time nominee for the Palme d'Or grand prize at the Cannes Film Festival for his films Awaara (1951) and Boot Polish (1954). His performance in Awaara was ranked as one of the top ten greatest performances of all time by Time magazine. His films attracted worldwide audiences, particularly in Asia and Europe. He was called \"the Clark Gable of the Indian film industry\". The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1971 for his contributions to the arts. India's highest award in cinema the Dadasaheb Phalke Award was bestowed him in 1987 by the Government of India.   Kapoor was born into a Punjabi Hindu family in 1924 at Kapoor Haveli, a house then owned by his father, in Peshawar, North Western Frontier Province, British India(in modern-day Pakistan), to Prithviraj Kapoor and Ramsarni Devi Kapoor. He was the eldest of six children in the family. He was the grandson of Dewan Basheshwarnath Kapoor and great-grandson of Dewan Keshavmal Kapoor, part of the famous Kapoor family. His brothers are actors Shashi Kapoor and the late Shammi Kapoor. He also had a sister named Urmila Sial. Two other siblings died in infancy. They later on moved from Peshawar into present-day India for residence and for education. His maternal cousin, Juggal Kishore Mehra, was a singer, whose daughter, Salma Agha, later became a Bollywood actress. As Prithviraj moved from city to city early in his career during the 1930s, the family had to move too. The constant move meant Raj Kapoor attended several different schools in cities like Dehradun, Calcutta(St Xavier's Collegiate School) and Mumbai. At the age of ten, he appeared in films for the first time, in 1935's Inquilab. After acting in several films over the next 12 years, Raj Kapoor's big break came with the lead role in Neel Kamal (1947) opposite Madhubala in her first role as a leading lady. In 1948, at the age of twenty-four, he established his own studio, R. K. Films, and became the youngest film director of his time making his directorial debut with Aag starring himself, Nargis, Kamini Kaushal and Premnath. In 1949 he co-starred alongside Dilip Kumar and Nargis in Mehboob Khan's hit film Andaz which was his first major success as an actor. He had his first success as producer, director and star of Barsaat released later that year.[citation needed] He went on to produce and star in several hit films made under his R.K. Banner including Awaara (1951), Shree 420 (1955), Chori Chori (1956), Jagte Raho (1956) and Jis Desh Men Ganga Behti Hai (1960), the last was directed by Radhu Karmakar, his longtime cinematographer, and which won Filmfare Award for Best Film. These films established his screen image modeled on Charlie Chaplin's most famous screen persona of The Tramp. Outside of his home productions, his other notable films as a leading actor included Anhonee (1952), Aah (1953), Anari (1959), Chhalia (1960) and Dil Hi To Hai (1963). He also produced the hit social films Boot Polish (1954). and Ab Dilli Door Nahin (1957).[citation needed] In 1964, he produced, directed and starred in the romantic musical Sangam alongside Rajendra Kumar and Vyjayantimala which was his first film in colour. This was his last major success as a leading actor as his later films like Around the World (1966) and Sapnon Ka Saudagar (1968) with younger starlets Rajshree and Hema Malini were box office flops. In 1965 he was a member of the jury at the 4th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1970 he produced, directed and starred in his ambitious film Mera Naam Joker which took more than six years to complete. His son Rishi Kapoor made his debut in this film playing the younger version of his character. When released in 1970, it was a box office disaster and put Kapoor and his family into a financial crisis. In later years it was acknowledged as a cult classic. In 1971, he launched his eldest son Randhir Kapoor in the family drama Kal Aaj Aur Kal starring himself, his son Randhir, his father Prithviraj Kapoor as well as Randhir's would-be-wife Babita. He launched his second son Rishi Kapoor's career in 1973 when he produced and directed Bobby which was a huge box office success and introduced actress Dimple Kapadia, later a very popular actress; it was the first of a new generation of teen romances. Dimple wore bikinis which was quite unique for Indian films then. In 1975 he acted alongside his son Randhir again in Dharam Karam, which Randhir also directed. In the latter half of the 1970s and early 1980s he produced and directed films that focused on the female protagonists: Satyam Shivam Sundaram (1978) with Zeenat Aman, Prem Rog (1982) with Padmini Kolhapure and Ram Teri Ganga Maili (1985) which introduced Mandakini. He acted in fewer films by the late 1970s and early 1980s but played a notable supporting role alongside Rajesh Khanna in Naukri (1978) and as the titular character alongside Sanjay Khan in Abdullah (1980). He played a detective in two comedy films directed by Naresh Kumar Do Jasoos (1975) and Gopichand Jasoos (1982). In 1979 he was a member of the jury at the 11th Moscow International Film Festival. Raj Kapoor's last major film appearance was in Vakil Babu (1982) where he appeared with his younger brother Shashi. His last acting role was a cameo appearance in a 1984 released British made-for-television film titled Kim. He was set to direct Henna starring his son Rishi and Pakistani actress Zeba Bakhtiar before his death in 1988. His son Randhir directed the film and it released in 1991. Raj Kapoor suffered from asthma in his later years; he died of complications related to asthma in 1988 at the age of 63. He collapsed at the event where he was to receive the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, and was taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) for treatment. He was hospitalised for about a month before he succumbed to complications arising from his asthma. At the time of his death, he was working on the movie Henna (an Indo-Pakistan based love story). The film was later completed by his sons Randhir and Rishi Kapoor and was released in 1991. Raj Kapoor is appreciated both by film critics and movie fans. Film historians and movie buffs speak of him as the \"Charlie Chaplin of Indian cinema,\" since he often portrayed a tramp-like figure, who, despite adversity, was still cheerful and honest. His fame spread worldwide. He was adored by audiences in large parts of Africa, the Middle East, the former Soviet Union, China, and Southeast Asia; his movies were global commercial successes. Raj had the knack of getting the best out of any one, since he had mastered all departments of film making and even marketing them.[peacock\u00a0term] His films reflected the Era in which it was made. Many of Raj Kapoor's movies had a patriotic theme. His films Aag, Shree 420 and Jis Desh Men Ganga Behti Hai (In the country where the Ganges flows) celebrated the newly independent India, and encouraged film-goers to be patriots. Raj Kapoor commissioned these famous lyrics for Mera Joota Hai Japani, a song from the movie Shree 420: The song is still extremely popular and has been featured in a number of movies since Shree 420 was released. Indian author Mahasweta Devi stopped the show with her inaugural speech at the 2006 Frankfurt Book Fair when she used these lyrics to express her own heartfelt patriotism and debt to her country. Raj Kapoor was a canny judge of filmi music and lyrics. Many of the songs he commissioned are evergreen hits. He introduced the music directors Shankar-Jaikishan and the lyricists Hasrat Jaipuri and Shailendra. He is also remembered for his strong sense of visual style. He used striking visual compositions, elaborate sets, and dramatic lighting to complete the mood set by the music. He introduced the actresses Nimmi, Dimple Kapadia, and Mandakini, as well as launching and reviving the careers of his sons Rishi, Randhir and Rajiv. Famous for making his actresses reveal the body, not very common then in Indian cinema, it was said his 'show-womanship' matched his showmanship. The 1967 \"Song about yogis\" (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0439\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432) by Vladimir Vysotsky mentions Raj Kapoor as one of the three best-known symbols of Indian culture in the Soviet Union, along with Shiva and yoga. A postage stamp, bearing his face, was released by India Post to honour him on 14 December 2001. To honour him, a brass statue of his was unveiled at Walk of the Stars at Bandra Bandstand in Mumbai in March 2012. In 2014, Google commemorated his 90th birthday. In 1946, Raj Kapoor married Krishna Malhotra (b. 1930), who was his first cousin once removed. The news of his marriage was reported in the cine-magazine Filmindia June 1946 issue as, \"Raj Kapoor, the talented and versatile son of Prithviraj Kapoor ended his career of wild oats by marrying Miss Krishna Malhotra in the second week of May at Rewa\". Krishna's father was Prithviraj Kapoor's maternal uncle. It was a match arranged by the family, and Krishna proved to be a wife and mother in the traditional mould, which is what the family wanted. Krishna's brothers, Rajendra Nath, Prem Nath and Narendra Nath, later became actors, and her sister Uma is married to Prem Chopra. The couple had five children: three sons, actors Randhir, Rishi and Rajiv, and two daughters: insurance agent Ritu and Rima. Randhir is married to actress Babita, while Rishi is married to actress Neetu Singh. Kapoor was rumoured to have had a longtime romantic relationship with the renowned actress Nargis during the 1940s and 1950s, despite being a married man, although neither ever publicly admitted to this. The couple starred in several films together, including Awaara and Shree 420. As Raj would not leave his wife and children, Nargis ended their relationship after Chori Chori and married Sunil Dutt with whom she fell in love on the set of Mother India (1957). Kapoor is also said to have had an affair with renowned actress Vyjayantimala during the shooting of Sangam. Vyjayanthimala has denied that she was ever involved with Kapoor. She deemed the whole thing a publicity stunt by Kapoor to promote his film. Kapoor has also been linked with the southern actress Padmini. Both of Kapoor's brothers, all three of Kapoor's sons, two of Kapoor's daughters-in-law and three of Kapoor's grandchildren have been active at various times in the film industry. His granddaughters Karisma and Kareena (daughters of Kapoor's eldest son Randhir), and grandson Ranbir (son of Kapoor's second son Rishi) are the latest Bollywood superstars from the Kapoor family, while another of his grandson, Nikhil Nanda (Kapoor's daughter Ritu's son), is a noted industrialist. Raj Kapoor: The Great Showman \u201cJeena Yahan, Marna Yahan, Iske Siwa, Jaana Kahan\u201c, very few people in this world understand the real meaning of these lines and I am glad, I understood them during the early phases of my life, thanks to my parents who made me watch this movie. I am not a Bollywood freak. But, yes there are some things that Bollywood offers that you just cannot ignore. The great showman, Raj Kapoor Sahab, was one of them. Kapoor had received many awards throughout his career, including 3 National Film Awards, 11 Filmfare Awards and 21 nominations. His films Awaara (1951) and Boot Polish (1954) were nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. His acting in the former was rated as one of the \"Top-Ten Performances of all time\", by the Time Magazine. His film Jagte Raho (1956) also won the Crystal Globe award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1971 and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1987\u00a0\u2013 the highest award for cinematic excellence in India. In 2001, he was honoured with \"Best Director of the Millennium\" by Stardust Awards. He was named \"Showman of the Millennium\" by Star Screen Awards in 2002. In June 2011, Noah Cowan, Artistic Director of TIFF Bell Lightbox, and Sabbas Joseph, Director, Wizcraft along with members of the Kapoor family came together to pay tribute to the life and work of Indian actor, director, mogul and legend Raj Kapoor, as presented in partnership by TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival), the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA), and the Government of Ontario.Indian Mirror Reports suggest Kapoor will be inducted onto the Brampton Walk of Fame in Ontario, Canada. Shankar-Jaikishan were Raj Kapoor's music director of choice. He worked with them in 20 films in all including 10 of his own films from Barsaat until Kal Aaj Aur Kal. (Jagte Raho with Salil Chowdhury and Ab Dilli Dur Nahin being two exceptions in this period). Only after Jaikishan died, did he turn to a different music director\u00a0\u2013 Laxmikant-Pyarelal for Bobby, Satyam Shivam Sundaram and Prem Rog (later on, his children used Laxmikant-Pyarelal for Prem Granth as well), Rahul Dev Burman for Dharam Karam, and Ravindra Jain for (Ram Teri Ganga Maili and Henna). It is interesting to note that Raj Kapoor acted in a movie with music by Madan Mohan only once(twice) i.e. Dhoon (1953) & Aashiana (1952) which featured duet Hum Pyaar Karenge by Hemant Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar, only instance Hemant Kumar giving playback to Raj Kapoor, and did only one movie with O. P. Nayyar (Do Ustad). List of films with Shankar-Jaikishan: (18 Films) Mukesh was Raj Kapoor's almost exclusive singing voice in almost all of his films. Also, when Mukesh died, Raj had said, Main ne apni aawaaz ko kho diya... (I have lost my voice...). However Manna Dey has also sung many notable and super-hit songs for Raj Kapoor, for instance in Shree 420 and Chori Chori. Examples of such Manna songs are best illustrated by the following list:"

He appeared in 84 films throughout the 1970s, 1980s till 1989. As an actor, he was mostly known for his supporting roles in big-budget films starring Sanjeev Kumar and Rajesh Khanna in the lead role. Later, he achieved fame for directing films with titles beginning with the letter \"K\" since 1987. As a filmmaker, his most notable work includes the drama Khudgarz (1987), the revenge drama Khoon Bhari Maang (1988), the comedy-drama Kishen Kanhaiya (1990), the crime thriller Karan Arjun (1995), the romance Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000), the science fiction Koi... Mil Gaya (2003) and the superhero Krrish film series (2006\u20142013). Roshan won the Filmfare Award for Best Director for directing the films, Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai and Koi... Mil Gaya.   Born in a Punjabi family, Roshan's father was the Bollywood music director Roshan, and his younger brother Rajesh Roshan is also a music director. Rakesh is married to Pinky, daughter of director J. Om Prakash. His son, Hrithik Roshan, is an actor. He also has a daughter, Sunaina. He studied in Sainik School, Satara, Maharashtra. Roshan started his career as an actor making his debut in the 1970 film Ghar Ghar Ki Kahani in which he got a supporting role. He got very few solo hero films in his career. He got solo hero roles as a hero in more women-oriented films where the focus would be more on the heroine like Paraya Dhan with Hema Malini, Aankh Micholi with Bharati, Khubsoorat with Rekha, Kaamchor with Jaya Prada. His few successful solo hero films, with focus equal on both hero and heroine were Aankhon Aankhon Mein with Rakhee, Nafrat with Yogita Bali, Ek Kunwari Ek Kunwara with Leena Chandaravarkar, Hamari Bahu Alka with Bindiya Goswami, Shubh Kaamna with Rati Agnihotri. J.Omprakash produced Ankhon Ankhon Mein with Rakesh in the lead. Later J.Omprakash directed Aakraman with Sanjeev Kumar in the lead and had Rakesh Roshan in supporting role and then produced Aakhir Kyun, with Rajesh Khanna in the lead and Rakesh in supporting role. Rakesh played supporting roles in few successful films like Man Mandir with Sanjeev Kumar in the lead, Khel Khel Mein with Rishi Kapoor in the lead, Bullet (1976 film) with Devanand as the hero, Hatyara with Vinod Khanna in lead role, Dhongee with Randhir Kapoor, Khandaan with Jeetendra, Neeyat with Shashi Kapoor as the lead hero. He played supporting roles regularly in films with Rajesh Khanna in the lead role and of them Chalta Purza was a failure and other three were blockbusters- Dhanwan (1981 film), Awaaz and Aakhir Kyon?. The few multi-star cast films he was part of as the lead hero to be successful between 1977\u20131986 were Devata, Shriman Shrimati and Hathkadi, all of which had Sanjeev Kumar as the main lead hero and Jaag Utha Insan and Ek Aur Sikander, which had Mithun Chakrborthy in main lead and other hits like Dil Aur Deewaar, Khatta Meetha (1978 film), Unees-Bees (1980), Maqaar (1986). Most of his other films as second lead hero or solo hero films between 1973 and 1990 were box office flops. Roshan set up his own production company Filmkraft in 1980 and their first production was Aap Ke Deewane (1980), which was a box office flop. His next venture was Kaamchor, which was produced by him, which became a hit but success of this film was attributed to its music and the heroine. His next solo hero film Shubkaamna directed by K. Vishwanath was a hit. He tried to re-launch himself as lead hero with Bhagwan Dada (1986), directed by J. Om Prakash and starring Rajnikanth as the main lead and himself in second lead. But Bhagwan Dada was a flop. Between 1984\u20131990 he only got supporting roles with exception of Bahurani. The multi star films where he was the second lead like Maqaar and Ek Aur Sikander were successful. His last film as a leading hero was Bahurani, which was a woman oriented film starring Rekha in the lead directed by Manik Chatterjee and released in 1989. He made his directorial debut with Khudgarz (1987) and went on to direct box office hits such as Khoon Bhari Maang (1988), Kishen Kanhaiya (1990), Karan Arjun (1995), and Madhuri Dixit starrer Koyla (1997). However his other directorial ventures flopped. During this time from 1990\u20131999 he only acted occasionally in films making guest appearances and focused mostly on direction. He launched his son Hrithik's career as an actor with Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000). Rakesh Roshan later revealed that this film was inspired from storyline of Aradhana starring Rajesh Khanna.  This film, the highest grosser of 2000, entered the Limca Book of Records for the most number of awards won by a Bollywood film. He directed his son again in the 2003 science fiction film Koi... Mil Gaya, which fetched him the Filmfare award 2004 for best director, and its sequel, the science fiction superhero film Krrish (2006) both of which were also very successful at the box office. In 2008 he produced the film Krazzy 4. In 2010 he released a Bollywood meets Hollywood crossover film titled Kites. Another version of this film was released internationally, and known as Brett Ratner presents Kites: The Remix. This version was shorter, and mainly toned down the amount of musical numbers. His latest film as producer was Kaabil, which released on 25th Jan 2017. The film stars \"Hrithik Roshan\" and \"Yami Gautam\" and it grossed over Rs. 100 Crores at box office. On 21 January 2000, Roshan was shot at by two Budesh gang members near his office on Tilak Road at Santacruz West. The assailants fired two bullets at him, one of which hit him on the left arm while the other grazed his chest. As the director fell to the ground, the assailants fled the scene. The assailants were later identified as Sunil Vithal Gaikwad and Sachin Kamble. The attack on Roshan was not undertaken with the intent to kill, but to signal that the Shiv Sena could no longer protect its clients. Roshan had stonewalled demands from Budesh for a percentage of the profits from the overseas sale of the Hindi blockbuster, Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai. Roshan has produced films under the banner Filmkraft Productions Pvt. Ltd."

She has since retired from the film industry. In one of her interviews she said in 2012 that her favourite co-star among her heroes were Rajesh Khanna and Shashi Kapoor.She was quoted saying \" Rajesh was like one of the seven wonders for the industry. There was magic in his face and mannerisms. He was shy and conservative but misunderstood. Why wouldn't he come three hours late for a shot when his co-actors including me took three hours to dress up? He did not use any make up ever. Would anybody from the current crop of actors do a film like Bawarchi?\".When she was questioned on her opinion on the films made, she quoted \"I am nobody to judge today's cinema but if you insist, here's my personal opinion. Today's hit films have a shelf life of seven days, the lyrics are incomprehensible, and the music is so noisy. Rajesh Khanna brought good films. Amitabh Bachchan brought bad films. I haven't liked a single SRK film after DDLJ.\" In her second marriage, Raakhee married film director, poet and lyricist Gulzar. The couple have a daughter, Meghna Gulzar. When their daughter was only one year old, they separated.

        "biography": " Ranbir Kapoor (pronounced\u00a0[r\u0259\u02c8\u0273bi\u02d0r k\u0259\u02c8pu\u02d0r]; born 28 September 1982) is an Indian actor and producer. The son of actors Rishi and Neetu, and the grandson of actor-director Raj, Kapoor pursued film-making and method acting at the School of Visual Arts and the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, respectively. He subsequently assisted Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the film Black (2005), and made his acting debut with Bhansali's tragic romance Saawariya (2007), a box office flop. Kapoor rose to prominence with his performances in three films of 2009\u2014the coming-of-age film Wake Up Sid, the comedy Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani, and the drama Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year. The 2011 drama Rockstar and the 2012 comedy-drama Barfi! earned Kapoor two consecutive Best Actor awards at Filmfare, and a starring role in the 2013 romantic comedy Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\u2014one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films\u2014established him as a leading Bollywood actor. However, he followed it by starring in a series of films that under-performed at the box office, although his performance in the romantic drama Tamasha (2015) was praised. This changed in 2016 when he starred as a musician in the commercially successful romance Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. Through his career in Bollywood films, Kapoor has become one of the most popular celebrities and one of the highest-paid actors in India. He is the recipient of several awards, including five Filmfare Awards. In addition to acting in films, Kapoor supports charities and causes. He is the co-founder of the production company Picture Shuru Productions, and is a co-owner of the Indian Super League football team Mumbai City FC.   Ranbir Kapoor was born on 28 September 1982 in Mumbai to Rishi and Neetu, both actors of the Hindi film industry. He is the great-grandson of Prithviraj and the grandson of actor-director Raj. His elder sister, Riddhima (born 1980), is an interior and fashion designer. The actresses Karisma and Kareena are his first cousins. Kapoor was educated at the Bombay Scottish School in Mahim. As a student, he found little interest in academics and would rank low among his peers. Kapoor has been vocal about how his parent's troubled marriage affected him as a child: \"Sometimes the fights would get really bad. I would be sitting on the steps, my head between my knees, till five or six in the morning, waiting for them to stop\". These experiences led to a \"reservoir of emotions building up inside [him]\", which he said compelled him to develop an interest in film. In his early years, Kapoor was close to his mother, but had a dysfunctional relationship with his father. After completing his tenth standard examinations, he worked as an assistant director to his father on the film Aa Ab Laut Chalen (1999), during which he developed a closer bond with him. After completing his pre-university education from the H.R. College of Commerce and Economics, Kapoor relocated to New York City to learn film-making at the School of Visual Arts, and subsequently pursued method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. In film school, Kapoor directed and starred in two short films, entitled Passion to Love and India 1964. The loneliness of living alone in New York City coupled with his experience in film school, which he described as \"useless\", inspired him to pursue a career in Bollywood. Upon returning to Mumbai, Kapoor was hired as an assistant director to Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the 2005 film Black. He described the experience: \"I was getting beaten up, abused, doing everything from cleaning the floor to fixing the lights from 7 am to 4 am, but I was learning every day.\" He later remarked that his motive for working on Black was to get Bhansali to offer him an acting job. Following the release of Black, Bhansali cast Kapoor as the protagonist of his 2007 tragic romance Saawariya, alongside Sonam Kapoor and Rani Mukerji. The film tells the story of a tramp, played by him, who falls obsessively in love with a woman awaiting the return of her lover. In an interview with the news and entertainment portal Rediff.com, Kapoor stated that his character was written as a tribute to his grandfather's iconic roles as a tramp. Saawariya was the first Indian film to be produced by a Hollywood studio (Sony Pictures Entertainment), and was a highly anticipated release. However, film critics were disappointed with the picture with BBC's Jaspreet Pandohar calling it a \"misfire on a massive scale\". CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand considered it \"contrived and fake\", but was impressed by Kapoor's \"affable charm\" and wrote that \"he\u2019s got that star quality to him which is so rare to find.\" At the box office, Saawariya failed to earn profits. However, at the annual Filmfare Awards ceremony, Kapoor was awarded a Best Male Debut trophy. Despite the commercial failure of Saawariya, Kapoor was contracted by Yash Raj Films for a primary role in the Siddharth Anand-directed romantic comedy Bachna Ae Haseeno (2008). The film was his first commercial success, in which his role was that of a womaniser who is romantically involved with three women, played by Bipasha Basu, Minissha Lamba, and Deepika Padukone, at different stages of his life. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times expressed mixed views on his performance, but predicted that his \"puppy-dog sweetness\" would \"serve him well as a Bollywood leading man\". In 2009, Kapoor had three film releases. In Dharma Productions's Wake Up Sid, a coming of age film from director Ayan Mukerji, Kapoor portrayed Siddharth \"Sid\" Mehra, a rich, lazy teenager whose life undergoes a series of changes after interacting with an ambitious journalist (played by Konkana Sen Sharma). When Mukerji narrated the then-untitled script of the film to him, Kapoor came up with the title himself. The media expressed doubt on the film's financial prospect as it depicted a romantic relationship between a younger man and an older woman. It eventually emerged as a sleeper hit and garnered acclaim from the critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama reviewed that Kapoor's performance in the film proved that he was \"amongst the best in the business today\". Kapoor next starred opposite Katrina Kaif in Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani, a slapstick comedy from director Rajkumar Santoshi, that emerged as the fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2009. Film critic Gaurav Malani praised Kapoor's flair for comedy, but criticised his \"over-excited husky baritone\". Kapoor's final release that year was the Shimit Amin-directed Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year, a drama about a sardar who aspires to be a salesman. Film critic Mayank Shekhar praised the film and found Kapoor's performance to be \"astonishingly sincere\", but the film earned little at the box office. Kapoor later professed to being highly disappointed by the film's commercial failure. At the 55th Filmfare Awards, Kapoor was awarded the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for his performances in all three of his 2009 releases, and he also received two Best Actor nominations at the ceremony for Wake Up Sid and Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani. Prakash Jha's big-budget ensemble political thriller Raajneeti was Kapoor's first release of 2010. The film, which starred Nana Patekar, Ajay Devgn, Arjun Rampal, Manoj Bajpayee, Katrina Kaif and Sarah Thompson in prominent roles, was inspired by the Indian epic The Mahabharata and Mario Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather. Kapoor's role was of Samar Pratap (based on the characters of Arjuna and Michael Corleone), the youngest heir of an Indian political dynasty, who is reluctantly drawn to politics after the assassination of his father. Kapoor described it as his first complex role and considered it a departure from the \"lover boy roles\" that he had previously played. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India reviewed: \"The film finally belongs to Ranbir Kapoor who perfects the art of minimalism\u2014and literally grows before your eyes\u2014as the simmering volcano that cannot be held back, once it erupts.\" Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times, however, was more critical of his performance which he considered \"stony rather than calculating\u2014especially jarring compared to the histrionic turns around him\". Indian trade journalists were apprehensive of Raajneeti recovering its \u20b9600 million (US$9.3\u00a0million) investment. The film, however, proved to be a major commercial success with worldwide earnings of over \u20b91.43 billion (US$22\u00a0million). Kapoor received a third Best Actor nomination at Filmfare for the film. Later that same year, Kapoor collaborated with Priyanka Chopra on Anand's Anjaana Anjaani, a comedy-drama involving two strangers who vow to commit suicide on New Year's Eve. The film was a moderate financial success, but garnered little praise from the critics. Rajeev Masand noted that Kapoor \"struggles with a badly-defined role\" and NDTV's Anupama Chopra concluded: \"Ranbir tries hard to salvage the film, dropping his shirt several times but even his lovingly shot chest can\u2019t save the film.\" Following an item number in the children's film Chillar Party (2011), Kapoor took on the role of Janardhan \"Jordan\" Jakhar in Imtiaz Ali's Rockstar, a drama that follows the journey of an aspiring musician from a humble background to international stardom. In preparation for the role, Kapoor lived with a Jat family in Pitam Pura and studied their mannerisms. He additionally learned to play the guitar and practiced extensively at A.R. Rahman's (the film's music composer) music studio. As part of the film's promotional activity, Kapoor performed at a live concert in Mumbai. Film critics were polarised on their view of the film, but were unanimous in their praise for Kapoor; Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis was particularly impressed with the film and thought that Kapoor's portrayal was one of \"Hindi cinema\u2019s most accomplished performances by a lead actor\". For the role, Kapoor won both the Best Actor and Best Actor (Critics) trophies at the 57th Filmfare Awards ceremony, along with Best Actor awards at Screen and IIFA. With a gross revenue of \u20b91.07 billion (US$17\u00a0million), Rockstar was one of the top-grossing Hindi films of the year. The 2012 romantic comedy Barfi! was Kapoor's first release to earn over \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million) at the domestic box office. Directed by Anurag Basu, the film (set in the 1970s) tells the story of its titular protagonist (a deaf and mute man, played by Kapoor) who falls in love with a woman who is already engaged (played by Ileana D'Cruz) and later, an autistic girl (played by Priyanka Chopra). In preparation, Kapoor observed the work of actors Roberto Benigni, Charlie Chaplin, and his grandfather. Barfi! received praise from the critics, and the performances of the three lead actors were acclaimed. Ronnie Scheib of Variety praised Kapoor for successfully channeling Chaplin in \"tone and affect\", and Raja Sen of Rediff.com wrote that \"he does very strongly indeed with this Chaplin-tribute role, bestowing his character with heart every step of the way\". The film was submitted as India\u2019s official entry for the 85th Academy Awards, and was screened at the Marrakech and Busan International Film Festivals. Kapoor won second consecutive Best Actor awards at the Filmfare, Screen, and IIFA Award ceremonies. Kapoor achieved further success in 2013 when he reunited with director Ayan Mukerji for the romantic comedy Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani co-starring Deepika Padukone, Kalki Koechlin, and Aditya Roy Kapoor. He was cast as Kabir \"Bunny\" Thapar, a commitment-phobic photographer, a character Kapoor found to be an extension of himself. His pairing with Padukone, after their highly publicised break-up, led to hype surrounding the film's release. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani emerged as one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time with earnings of \u20b93.02 billion (US$47\u00a0million), proving to be Kapoor's third consecutive commercial success in three years and earned him another Best Actor nomination at Filmfare. Film critics found the film to be \"riddled with clich\u00e9s\", but praised both Kapoor and Padukone, with Daily News and Analysis' Tushar Joshi labelling their on-screen chemistry as \"unsurpassable\". Kapoor's second release of 2013 was the action-comedy film Besharam in which he played a petty thief, alongside Pallavi Sharda and his parents. The film met with an overwhelming negative reception and emerged as a failure; Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu described it as \"Kapoor's hall of shame\". After a year-long absence from the screen, Kapoor featured as a mysterious thief in Roy (2015), a romantic thriller which critic Sarita A. Tanwar described as a \"boring, exhausting and pretentious\" film. The series of financial failures continued with his next release, the Anurag Kashyap-directed crime drama Bombay Velvet, based on the historian Gyan Prakash's book Mumbai Fables, which also starred Anushka Sharma and Karan Johar. Kapoor portrayed an ambitious boxer in the 1960s who is drawn towards a life of crime; he based his tapori diction on Johnny Walker's character in Mr. & Mrs. '55 (1955). Made on a budget of \u20b91.2 billion (US$19\u00a0million), the film opened to meager box-office collections and mixed reviews from critics. Ritika Bhatia of Business Standard found Kapoor's part to be a departure from his previous roles, writing that he \"does test the waters with methodical sincerity but his portrayal lacks depth on occasion\". Bombay Velvet was eventually screened at the Locarno and Bucheon film festivals. Kapoor next reunited with Deepika Padukone to film Tamasha (2015), a romantic drama from Imtiaz Ali. He played the role of Ved Sahni, a man who desires a career in the arts but settles for a life of monotony as an engineer. As with his previous three releases, the film failed commercially and received mixed reviews from critics. Kapoor's performance, however, was praised; Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"Kapoor is beautifully cast, his trademark mix of assertive theatricality and subtle emotion well suited to the role of a man who seemingly has it all under control, until he doesn\u2019t.\" Kapoor's career prospect improved in 2016 when he took on the leading role of an aspiring musician in Karan Johar's Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016). The romantic drama, co-starring Anushka Sharma and Aishwarya Rai, tells the story of unrequited love, and proved to be one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of the year. Critical reception for the film, however, was mixed; Joe Leydon of Variety thought that \"Kapoor [is] often erring on the side of annoying while trying to balance vulnerability and self-centeredness\". Both Tamasha and Ae Dil Hai Mushkil earned Kapoor Best Actor nominations at Filmfare. As of October 2016, Kapoor is working on the comedy-mystery film Jagga Jasoos. The feature will be produced by his production company (Picture Shuru Productions) in collaboration with director Anurag Basu. In addition, he is filming opposite Alia Bhatt for Ayan Mukerji's Dragon, a fantasy film about a man with superpowers, and portrays the actor Sanjay Dutt in a biopic directed by Rajkumar Hirani. Kapoor has been vocal about his personal life, and has stated that the his parents' marriage taught him how complex a relationship can be. He had his first serious relationship while in the seventh grade, and suffered from depression when it ended. While filming Bachna Ae Haseeno in 2008, Kapoor began dating his co-star Deepika Padukone. The relationship attracted substantial media coverage in India and they speculated on an impending engagement. However, the couple broke up a year later. Kapoor maintained that the split was amicable, though the media widely reported that the split was due to infidelity on Kapoor's part. Kapoor later confessed: \"Yes, I have, out of immaturity, out of inexperience, out of taking advantage of certain temptations, out of callousness.\" Later in 2015, Kapoor stated that they both had resolved the conflict and had moved on with their lives. Since the split, he has been reticent to publicly discuss his personal life. Rumours of an affair with Katrina Kaif first emerged during the production of Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani in 2009. In August 2013, a set of paparazzi photographs of Kapoor and Kaif at a beach in Spain were published by Stardust. Although Kapoor initially declined to speak of the relationship, he admitted to it in 2015: \"Both of us are sure about our relationship and if we don't open about it now, it would be showing disrespect to the relationship.\" As of February 2016, the media reported that they had broken up. In addition to acting, Kapoor is a football enthusiast and supports charities and organisations. He is the vice-captain of the All Stars Football Club, a celebrity football club that raises money for charity. In March 2013, he played the game to raise funds for the Magic Funds Organisation, an NGO for underprivileged children. Along with the chartered accountant Bimal Parekh, Kapoor acquired ownership rights in 2014 for the Mumbai-based football team of the Indian Super League, named Mumbai City FC. Also that year, Kapoor announced his participation with the digital music company Saavn as a content and programming adviser. In 2016, he featured in the documentary series Girls with Goals, to create awareness about and raise funds for YUWA, an all-girls football team in the state of Jharkhand. Kapoor supports the empowerment of the girl child and is the goodwill ambassador of Shabana Azmi's Mijwan Welfare Society, an NGO which helps empower women. He supports environmental charities, and in 2011 donated money to the Community Water Initiative, a charitable organisation owned by PepsiCo. In 2012, he appeared alongside other celebrities in a short film by Zoya Akhtar to generate awareness on breast cancer. He is the campaign ambassador for NDTV's Marks for Sports, a nationwide initiative to promote fitness and health in India. In 2013, Kapoor participated in an auction on eBay, where the highest bidder gets an opportunity to interact with him; the proceeds were donated to Save the Children, a non-profit organisation that raised funds for flood affected households in Uttarakhand. That same year, he appeared alongside other celebrities in a commercial, produced by the National Film Development Corporation of India, to create awareness about children's education. In December 2014, Kapoor again took part in an eBay auction; the phiran he wore in Rockstar was sold, with proceeds going to the redevelopment of the flood-ravaged states of Kashmir and Assam. Kapoor had also fronted a campaign to collect donations for the victims of the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. In 2015, he presented 2,000 raincoats to the Mumbai traffic police as an appreciation for their service during the year's heavy monsoon. Born into a family of popular actors, Kapoor faced the media spotlight from a young age; Hindustan Times published that \"he was always a star kid from whom everyone had great expectations\". Despite the failure of his first film (Saawariya), IANS reported that he \"rose like [a] meteor on film firmament by giving compelling performances in films like Raajneeti, Rockstar and [..] Barfi!\" Discussing the commercial viability of Kapoor, Apoorva Mehta (the COO of Dharma Productions) noted in 2013, \"In a short career span of 10 films, Ranbir Kapoor has achieved a tremendous jump in the business done by his films.\" Also that year, The Economic Times credited him as \"the most bankable actor of his generation\". However, following the success of Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, each of Kapoor's releases under-performed at the box-office. This led trade journalists to criticise his choice of films, noting that his inclination towards experimental projects negatively impacted his commercial appeal. Nationally, Kapoor is one of the most popular and high-profile celebrities. In 2012 and 2013 Forbes featured him among the top twenty in India's Celebrity 100, a list based on the income and popularity of the country's celebrities. For the next two years, he was ranked 11th with an estimated annual earning of \u20b993.25 crore (US$14\u00a0million) and \u20b985 crore (US$13\u00a0million) respectively, making him one of the highest-paid actors in the country. Kapoor has frequently featured in Rediff.com's annual listing of \"Bollywood's Best Actors\"; he was ranked second in 2009, first in 2011, third in 2012, and held the sixth position in 2015. Kapoor has been cited as one of the most attractive Indian celebrities by the media. He has featured on The Times of India's listing of the 'Most Desirable Man' from 2010 to 2015, ranking among the top ten each year. In 2009 People magazine listed him as the \"Sexiest Man Alive\" in India, and in 2013 he topped Filmfare's poll of the \"Most Stylish Young Actor\". Also in 2013, he was one of the recipients of the \"People of the Year\" award by the Limca Book of Records. In 2010, he was voted the \"Sexiest Asian Man\" in a poll conducted by the magazine Eastern Eye. Kapoor continued to feature among the top ten of the list from 2011\u20132014. Kapoor is also the celebrity endorser for various brands and services, including Pepsi, Panasonic, Renault India, Lenovo and the Spanish football club FC Barcelona. Nitesh Tiwari Kapoor has been the recipient of five Filmfare Awards: Best Male Debut for Saawariya (2007), Critics Award for Best Actor for Wake Up Sid (2009), Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009), and Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year (2009) (jointly for the three films), and Rockstar (2011), and Best Actor awards for Rockstar (2011) and Barfi! (2012)."

        "biography": " Randhir Kapoor (born 15 February 1947) is an Indian film actor, producer and director, who works in the Hindi film industry. An established actor of the 1970s and a two-time Filmfare Award nominee, Kapoor's career declined in the early 80s and failed to revive, though he continued to appear in films with supporting roles. Part of the Kapoor family, he is the son of actor and filmmaker Raj, grandson of actor Prithviraj and the brother of actor Rishi. After working as a child artist in several films, Kapoor made his acting and direction debut with a leading role in the romantic drama Kal Aaj Aur Kal (1971), a moderate box-office success. Subsequently, Kapoor's starring roles in the dramas Jeet (1972) and Raampur Ka Lakshman (1972), and the erotic thriller Jawani Diwani (1972), and the romantic comedies Hamrahi (1974), Haath Ki Safai (1974), Lafange (1975) and Ponga Pandit (1975), established him as a leading actor of Hindi cinema. After starring in the drama Kasme Vaade (1978), which earned him critical acclaim and a Best Supporting Actor nomination at Filmfare, Kapoor's career declined in the 80s, and failed to propel forward after which he quit acting for over a decade. However Kapoor's directed-blockbuster romantic drama Henna (1991), proved to be the most commercially successful film of the decade\u2013earning him a Filmfare Award for Best Director nomination and was chosen as the Indian submission to the Oscar. In recent years, Kapoor has occasionally returned to films with his biggest commercial success, the ensemble comedy Housefull (2010), and followed it with it's sequel (2012), both of which earned over \u20b91 billion (US$15 million) worldwide and featured him in supporting roles. Kapoor is married to actress Babita Shivdasani since 1971, with whom he has two daughters, actresses Karisma and Kareena Kapoor. The couple separated in 1998, but reconciled in 2007, after living separately for several years.   Kapoor was born on 15 February 1947 in Chembur, Bombay, Bombay Presidency, India (now known as Mumbai, Maharashtra) to Punjabi parents. His family moved from Peshawar and Samundri (now in Pakistan) to Bombay, before the partition of India, for acting career. He is an alumnus of Colonel Brown Cambridge School, Dehradun. He belongs to the famous Kapoor family who have been part of the Hindi film industry since the late 1920s. He is the eldest son of actor and filmmaker Raj Kapoor and his wife Krishna Kapoor.

Randhir Kapoor made his acting and directorial debut with Kal Aaj Aur Kal (1971) which also starred his wife, father and grandfather. The film, produced under the R.K banner, was an average success. After his debut, he acted in three consecutive hit films, all released in 1972: Jeet, Raampur Ka Lakshman and Jawani Diwani. Jawani Deewani was one of the biggest hits of that year. 'Raampur Ka Lakshman', costarred Shatrughan Sinha and Rekha, and was directed by Manmohan Desai, with music by R.D. Burman. After which remake of MGR\u2019s hit 1971 film Rickshawkaran was made in Hindi in 1973 with Randhir as the lead hero opposite new heroine Neetu Singh but the film flopped though its music was popular. In 1974 he had 2 big hits \u2013 Hamrahi and the two hero film Haath Ki Safai as hits but Dil Diwana failed to be a hit at the box-office, in spite of its music being better than its predecessor Jawani Deewani. In 1975, two of his films, Lafange and Ponga Pandit, were hits, but his other two movies, Dafa 302 and Dharam Karam (which he also directed), were box-office failures. From 1976 till 1981, Randhir had solo hero hit films like \u2013 Khalifa, Aaj Ka Mahaatma, Bhanwar, Bhala Manus, Ram Bharose, Dhongee and his multi-star films like Chacha Bhatija (1977), Kasme Vaade (1978), the later of which earned him a Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination, Mama Bhanja, Heeralal Pannalal, Dhyanu Bhagat also known as Bhakti Mein Shakti, Chor Ke Ghar Chor, Biwi-O-Biwi: The Fun-Film were hits too. After the failure of the 1981 Harjaee, he got few offers to star or co-star in films. His film Nikkamma, begun in 1976, was finally released in 1983 as Jaan-e-Jaan, was also a dud. The song composed by R.D. Burman, and sung by Kishore Kumar and Asha Bhosle \u2013 \"Tere Bina Mein Kuch Bhi Nahin Hoon\" from the delayed film Janejaan was popular in 1983. He starred in Sawaal and Pukar in 1983, and received critical praise for his performance, but they flopped nonetheless. In the same year, Humse Na Jeeta Koi received average collections. His last film as an actor was Khazana in 1987 after which he did appear in a film for a decade. In 1991, he directed and produced the blockbuster Henna (1991), that starred his younger brother, Rishi Kapoor and Pakistani actress Zeba Bakhtiar. The film had started production in 1988 with his father Raj Kapoor directing but after his death, Randhir took over as director of the film.

        "biography": " Rani Mukerji (/r\u0251\u02d0ni\u02d0 m\u1d7fkh\u0259rd\u0292i\u02d0/; born 21 March 1978) is an Indian actress. Through her Bollywood career, she has become one of the most high-profile celebrities in India, winning several awards, including seven Filmfare Awards. Her film roles have been cited as a significant departure from the traditional portrayal of women in Bollywood. Although Mukerji was born into the Mukherjee-Samarth family, in which her parents and relatives were members of the Indian film industry, she did not aspire to pursue a career in film. However, while still a teenager she dabbled with acting by playing a supporting role in her father's Bengali language film Biyer Phool (1996) and later accepted a leading role in the 1997 social drama Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat on the insistence of her mother. She then began a full-time career in film and gained recognition for a supporting role in the romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998). After this initial success in her career, Mukerji's films fared poorly at the box office for the next three years. Her career prospects improved when Yash Raj Films cast her as the star of the drama Saathiya (2002). By 2004, Mukerji had established herself as a leading actress of Bollywood with roles in the romantic comedy Hum Tum and the dramas Yuva and Veer-Zaara. She achieved further success for portraying a deaf, blind and mute woman in the acclaimed drama Black (2005) and an unhappily married woman in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to criticise her for choosing poor roles and pairing with the same set of actors. The semi-biographical thriller No One Killed Jessica (2011) proved to be her first box office hit in four years, and she followed it by starring in the successful thrillers Talaash: The Answer Lies Within (2012) and Mardaani (2014). In addition to acting in films, Mukerji is involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show Dance Premier League. Though she is reticent to discuss her personal life in public, her off-screen life is the subject of substantial media coverage in India. She is married to filmmaker Aditya Chopra, with whom she has a daughter.   Rani Mukerji was born in Mumbai on 21 March 1978. Her father, Ram Mukherjee (born to the Mukherjee-Samarth family), is a former film director and one of the founders of Filmalaya Studios. Her mother, Krishna Mukherjee, is a former playback singer. Her elder brother, Raja Mukherjee, is a film producer and director. Her maternal aunt, Debashree Roy, is a Bengali film actress and her paternal cousin, Kajol, is a Hindi film actress and her contemporary. Another paternal cousin, Ayan Mukerji, is a scriptwriter and film director. Despite her parents and most of her relatives being members of the Indian film industry, Mukerji was uninterested in pursuing a career in film. She said, \"There were already too many actresses at home and I wanted to be someone different\". Mukerji received her education at Maneckji Cooper High School in Juhu and graduated with a degree in Home Science from SNDT Women's University. She is a trained Odissi dancer and began learning the dance form while in the tenth grade. As part of an annual tradition, the Mukherjee family celebrates the festival of Durga Puja in the suburban neighbourhood of Santacruz every year. Mukerji, a practising Hindu, takes part in the festivities with her entire family. In 1994, director Salim Khan approached her to play the lead female role in his directorial, Aa Gale Lag Jaa. Her father disapproved of a full-time career in film at such a young age, so she rejected the offer. At the age of eighteen, Mukerji experimented with acting by portraying a supporting role in her father's Bengali language film Biyer Phool (1996). The film starred Prosenjit and Indrani Haldar in lead roles and narrates the story of two sisters; Mukerji played the younger sibling of Haldar's character. Soon after, Khan approached her with another film offer to play the protagonist of the social drama Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat, Mukerji accepted the role due to her mother's insistence that she continue to pursue acting on an experimental basis. Before she began work on the film, Mukerji trained at Roshan Taneja's acting institute. Mukerji portrayed a rape victim who is forced to marry her rapist in Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat, which released in 1997. Although the film was a commercial failure, Mukerji's performance was praised, and she won a special recognition trophy at the annual Screen Awards ceremony. Following the film's poor showing at the box office, Mukerji returned to college to complete her education. However, inspired by her cousin Kajol's success in Bollywood, she decided to pursue a full-time career in films. In 1998, Mukerji starred opposite Aamir Khan in Vikram Bhatt's Ghulam (1998), her first commercial success. Though her role in the film was small, the song \"Aati Kya Khandala\" earned her widespread recognition. Due to Mukerji's broken voice texture, Bhatt hired a dubbing artist with a much higher pitched voice to dub for her lines. When asked if the director's decision to not use her voice in the film affected her, she said that her voice was dubbed as it \"did not suit the character\". Later that year, Karan Johar cast Mukerji opposite Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol in his directorial debut Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. The role was originally written for Twinkle Khanna, but when she rejected it, Johar signed Mukerji on the insistence of Khan and Aditya Chopra. Johar had originally intended that a dubbing artist dub Mukerji's lines in the film, but she improved her diction and eventually dubbed for her own lines. She portrayed Tina Malhotra, a college student who is in a relationship with Khan's character. Writing for India Today, film critic Nandita Chowdhury considered Mukerji to be the scene-stealer and added, \"Oozing oomph from every pore, she [..] proves herself an actress whose time has come.\" Kuch Kuch Hota Hai proved a breakthrough for Mukerji; it emerged as a blockbuster in India and abroad with earnings of over \u20b91.03 billion (US$16\u00a0million), and won eight Filmfare Awards, including a Best Supporting Actress trophy for Mukerji. Following the success of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Mukerji played leading roles in the social drama Mehndi (1998) and the comedy Hello Brother (1999). Both these films were critical and commercial disappointments which failed to propel her career forward. By 2000, Mukerji wanted to avoid being type-cast as a \"standard Hindi film heroine\" and thus decided to portray more challenging roles in addition to the archetypical glamorous female lead. However, none of her film releases in 2000 were particularly notable. In Badal and Bichhoo, two male-centric action dramas (both featuring Bobby Deol in the lead), she played roles that were met with little acclaim from the critics. A supporting role in Kamal Hassan's bilingual film Hey Ram proved more rewarding. The film was a partly fictionalised account of Mahatma Gandhi's assassination and Mukerji portrayed the character of Aparna Ram, a Bengali school teacher who is raped and murdered during communal riots in Calcutta. The controversial subject matter of Hey Ram led to poor box office earnings, but the film was critically acclaimed and selected as India's official entry to the Oscars that year. Mukerji found no success in her next two releases, the comedy Hadh Kar Di Aapne and the romance Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye. The romantic comedy Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega, however, earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at Filmfare and was better received by the critics. Padmaraj Nair of Screen found Mukerji's role to be \"too meagre for her to prove herself\" but added that \"she is quite adequate in whatever scenes she has been given\". The year 2001 was a disappointing one for Mukerji. In a review for her first release of the year, Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, a drama based on surrogate childbirth, film critic Sukanya Verma found Mukerji to be \"handicapped with a role that doesn't give her much scope besides weeping and sobbing\" and preferred the \"meatier\" role of her co-star Preity Zinta. In Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai and Nayak: The Real Hero, films that failed to garner praise, Mukerji played the love interests of Abhishek Bachchan and Anil Kapoor respectively. In a review for the latter, Sarita Tanwar wrote that \"[Mukerji] has very little to do except being part of some magnificently picturised songs\". After three consecutive years of poorly received films, Mukerji's career prospects began to improve in 2002 when Yash Raj Films, a leading production company in India, cast her for two high-profile productions: Mujhse Dosti Karoge!, a romantic comedy co-starring Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor, and Saathiya, a remake of the Tamil box office hit Alaipayuthey. Mujhse Dosti Karoge! was heavily promoted before release and proved a success internationally, but failed to earn profits in India. The romantic drama Saathiya proved a major turning point in her career, winning her a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress in addition to a Best Actress nomination at the same ceremony. Mukerji was director Shaad Ali's only choice to play the lead role; he said, \"She was born to play this role. She looked the character. She looked vulnerable. She looked the right age. She was perfect\". The film co-starred Vivek Oberoi, and her paternal aunt Tanuja, and proved an economic success. Mukerji's portrayal of Suhani Sharma, a medical student who deals with the tensions and discontent of being married at a young age, met with critical acclaim. The BBC stated that \"Mukerji plays the character of a middle class girl with great conviction\", and Udita Jhunjhunwala of Mid Day added, \"Her expressions and acting are understated in a role that fits her like a glove.\" In 2003, Mukerji replaced Aishwarya Rai to play the lead female role opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Aziz Mirza's romance Chalte Chalte. Media reports suggested that Rai was replaced after feuding with her then boyfriend Salman Khan on the film's sets, but Shah Rukh Khan insisted that Mukerji had been the original choice for the role. The film's concept was similar to Saathiya and dealt with misunderstandings between a married couple. Mukerji said, \"[Unlike Saathiya], Chalte Chalte deals with a more mature and deeper form of love. It is about how a man and woman react to situations. [..] You cannot really get very different with the characters, but you can put them against a different background\". The film was well received by both critics and audiences, and the following year Mukerji received a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. Also that year, she starred in Milan Luthria's romantic comedy Chori Chori opposite Ajay Devgan, Sudhir Mishra's suspense drama Calcutta Mail, alongside Anil Kapoor and Manisha Koirala, and J.P. Dutta's ensemble war film LOC Kargil. None of these films fared well critically or commercially. The year 2004 marked the beginning of the most successful period in Mukerji's career. At the 50th Filmfare Awards in 2005, Mukerji won both the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress awards, becoming the only actress to win both awards in the same year. The Best Supporting Actress win was for Mani Ratnam's Yuva (2004), a composite film that featured an ensemble cast including Ajay Devgan, Abhishek Bachchan, Vivek Oberoi, Kareena Kapoor and Esha Deol. The film narrates the story of three youngsters from different strata of society whose lives intersect by a car accident; Mukerji was cast as Shashi Biswas, a financially deprived Bengali housewife who is abused by her husband, a local goon (played by Bachchan). Taran Adarsh wrote, \"Amongst the leading ladies, it is Rani Mukerji who is the best of the lot. The role demanded an actress of substance and Rani more than lives up to the expectations.\" She won the Best Actress award for her starring role in Kunal Kohli's Hum Tum (2004), a romantic comedy about two headstrong individuals who meet at different stages of their lives. The film pitted her opposite Saif Ali Khan and proved one of the biggest commercial successes of the year. The Hindu found Mukerji's portrayal of Rhea Prakash to be \"self assuredly competent\" and Tanmaya Kumar Nanda of Rediff.com wrote, \"Rani is her usual collected self, changing into the many hues of her character with the ease of a chameleon\". Later that year, Mukerji achieved further success when Yash Chopra cast her alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta in his romantic drama Veer-Zaara. The film narrates the story of star-crossed lovers, Veer Pratap Singh (played by Khan) and a Pakistani woman, Zaara Hayaat Khan (played by Zinta); Mukerji played the role of Saamiya Siddiqui, a Pakistani lawyer embroiled in a court case involving Singh. With a worldwide gross of over \u20b9940 million (US$15\u00a0million), Veer-Zaara emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year; it was screened at the Berlin Film Festival and met with critical acclaim. Mukerji's role was praised by the critics; BBC noted, \"[I]ts Rani Mukerjee who deserves praise for her acting. To act through your eyes and not using dialogue is an art. Rani for one, has perfected this.\" She won the Best Supporting Actress trophy at the IIFA Awards ceremony, and received a nomination in the same category at Filmfare. In 2005, Outlook magazine published that Mukerji had established herself as the most successful actress of contemporary Hindi cinema. Her first film role that year was opposite Amitabh Bachchan in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's highly acclaimed Black, a drama about an alcoholic man who dedicates his life to teach a blind and deaf girl how to communicate. Bhansali wrote the part of the blind-deaf girl specifically for Mukerji, who was initially hesitant to take on the role due to its \"challenging\" subject matter. Once Bhansali enforced his faith in her, she agreed and began intensely studying sign language with professionals at the Helen Keller Institute in Mumbai. Black won several awards including two National Film Awards and eleven Filmfare Awards, and Richard Corliss of TIME featured it as the fifth best film of the year. Mukerji's performance met with unanimous acclaim; Empire called the performance \"astonishing\", Filmfare included her work in their listing of Indian cinema's \"80 Most Iconic performances\" and wrote, \"Rani has left an indelible mark with this role that usually comes once in a lifetime for most\". She became the only actress to win both the Best Actress and Best Actress\u00a0\u2013 Critics trophies at the Filmfare Awards ceremony. That year, Mukerji received a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her work opposite Abhishek Bachchan in Bunty Aur Babli, a comedy film which marked her fifth collaboration with Yash Raj Films. She played the title character of Vimmi \"Babli\" Saluja, a con woman. The film was the second highest-grossing film of 2005 and Mukerji's third major success in two consecutive years. Film critic Namrata Joshi wrote that \"Rani plays to the gallery with ease\" and Taran Adarsh wrote that she \"sinks her teeth into the role and comes out with flying colours\". She followed it with Amol Palekar's fantasy film Paheli, reuniting her with Shah Rukh Khan. The film was a box office flop in India but was given a strong international release; it was screened at the Sundance Film Festival and was India's submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards. Raja Sen of Rediff.com was impressed by the film as well as Mukerji's performance which he called \"another perfectly played part\". Mukerji's fourth and final release of the year was the highly anticipated period film Mangal Pandey: The Rising. Director Ketan Mehta initially approached her for a cameo appearance, which was developed into an \"important part\" after she gave her consent to star in the film. Her role was that of Heera, a prostitute who forms the love interest of the title character (played by Aamir Khan). Derek Elley of Variety mentioned that Mukerji made \"the most of her feisty nautch-girl,\" despite having \"a small role for a star of her caliber.\" Mukerji turned down an offer from Mira Nair to star in the Hollywood film The Namesake, choosing instead to collaborate once again with her friend Karan Johar in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), an urban drama dealing with infidelity and dysfunctional relationships. The high-profile production featured an ensemble cast of Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Preity Zinta and Kirron Kher, and told the story of two unhappily married couples in New York which results in an extra-marital affair. Mukerji played Maya Talwar, a woman layered with self-doubt and question about the relationship between her husband (played by Abhishek Bachchan) and herself. Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna was a popular release, emerging as a major economic success with gross earnings of over \u20b91.13 billion (US$17\u00a0million). Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN wrote, \"Rani looks a million bucks and she dives under the skin of her character to make that part one that we will remember for a long time\". The role won Mukerji a third consecutive IIFA Best Actress Award and among other nods, earned her a sixth Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. The poorly received melodrama Baabul was her final appearance that year. Following the failure of Baabul, Yash Raj Films cast Mukerji in Siddharth Anand's family drama Ta Ra Rum Pum in the role of a popular racing driver's (played by Saif Ali Khan) wife and the mother of two. Mukerji was excited to play the part of a mother for the first time, and modelled her character after her own mother. Released in 2007, the film was an economic success, but received mixed reactions from the critics. Khalid Mohamed hailed Mukerji's performance as \"near flawless\" but Rajeev Masand thought that neither she nor Khan \"are able to make much of an impression because their characters are so unidimensional and boring.\" The woman's film Laaga Chunari Mein Daag from director Pradeep Sarkar was Mukerji's second release that year. She described the film as a \"journey of a girl into womanhood and her sacrifices for her family\". Her portrayal earned her a seventh Best Actress nomination at Filmfare, she played the role of Vibhavari Sahay, a young girl of limited means who is forced to moonlight as a prostitute to fend for her family. Jaya Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Konkana Sen Sharma and Kunal Kapoor co-starred in the film which released to poor box office returns and little praise from the critics. The Indian Express noted that Mukerji was responsible for \"hold[ing] the film together, even if her part, both as the ing\u00e9nue and the hooker, doesn't have freshness\". Mukerji played a prostitute for the third time in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Saawariya, an adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky's White Nights, co-starring Ranbir Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor. Mukerji said, \"I play very different kinds of prostitutes in Saawariya and Laaga Chunari Mein Daag. The woman in Saawariya has no problem with her profession, whereas in the other film it's completely different\". Saawariya was her only release in three years that was not produced by Yash Raj Films. The film was a box office flop and met with polarising reactions from the critics. Mukerji's performance was received favourably and she earned her second Filmfare nomination that year, this time for Best Supporting Actress. By the end of 2007, Mukerji's popularity had begun to wane. Rediff.com attributed this to her \"monotonous pairing\" with the same set of actors; Hindustan Times published that she had become an \"exclusive Yash Raj heroine\" which hindered other directors to approach her for roles. After a series of serious roles, Mukerji sought to play a part that would be a \"clutter-breaker\" for her. She found the role in Kunal Kohli's Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic (2008), a children's film about an angel who comes to Earth to help four troubled kids. In a particularly scathing review, Khalid Mohamed criticised Mukerji's choice of roles and wrote, \"As a Geeta Poppins, she's one-dimensional, either darting full blast smiles or tetchy scowls. Her costumes, too, are uneasy-on-the-eyes\". The film had low box office returns and further contributed to a decline in Mukerji's career prospects. An India Today article spoke of her \"running out of luck at the box office\" and mentioned her decline in endorsements. In an attempt to overcome this decline in her career, Mukerji lost weight and underwent a complete makeover. In 2009, she collaborated for the ninth time with Yash Raj Films on Dil Bole Hadippa!, a romantic comedy opposite Shahid Kapoor. Mukerji had high expectations from the film in which she played a cricket-obsessed Punjabi village girl masquerading as a man; it was hugely hyped before release and had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. The Economic Times critic Gaurav Malani was disappointed with the picture and wrote, \"Rani Mukherjee comes up with a spirited performance but her mock sob-whine-whimper do[es] not amuse anymore. Also after a point you dislike visualizing the charming actress as the moustached male player.\" The film was Mukerji's fourth economic failure in a row. When questioned about her recent spate of flops with the Yash Raj Films banner, she stated, \"An actor is here to act and pick great roles and scripts. I was getting great roles from Yash Raj at that point, roles that any actor would give an arm to do. I stand by those films regardless of their fate\". Later that year, she featured as a talent judge for the Sony Entertainment Television reality show Dance Premier League. She said that appearing on television would make her \"more accessible\" to the audiences and help her \"gain visibility\" when she was \"not doing too many films\". Mukerji did not make any screen appearances in 2010. Film critic Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis described Mukerji's performance in the 2011 film No One Killed Jessica as \"one of her best performances till date\". The film (co-starring Vidya Balan) was Mukerji's first commercial success since Ta Ra Rum Pum, and was especially noted for being a success despite the absence of a prominent male actor. The film was a semi-biographical thriller based on the Jessica Lal murder case in which Mukerji played the fictional character of Meera Gaity, a foul-mouthed television journalist who is deeply involved with the case. To promote the film, she reprised the role of Gaity on the C.I.D. television series. In an interview with The Telegraph she said, \"It was such a different role to portray. It wasn't a role that was typical of a Hindi film heroine. Meera was more like a hero. It was a character that actually took the story forward. [..] Meera made a lot of things happen. It wasn't something that I had ever done before. I actually had to play a man!\" Certain critics, however, were critical of her performance, including Anupama Chopra of NDTV, who called her role, \"the fatal, false note in No One Killed Jessica,\" arguing that \"the character is written superficially and Rani's portrayal of her is equally banal. It's all about externals. She argues a lot and proudly labels herself a bitch but her hair stays perfectly in place and in the end, she even gets to do a super-hero-like slow motion walk.\" Nonetheless, the role earned her several awards and nominations, including a third Best Supporting Actress trophy at Filmfare. After the success of No One Killed Jessica, Mukerji accepted a leading role in Sachin Kundalkar's Aiyyaa (2012), a comedy of manners co-starring Prithviraj. She played Meenakshi Deshpande, a woman with a heightened sense of smell who develops a one-sided attraction towards Prithiviraj's character. Critically and commercially unsuccessful. Rediff.com criticised her decision to star in the film, writing that she \"gets no support from the way her character is written\". Greater success came for her portrayal of Roshni Shekhawat, a mother who has lost her only child in a boating accident, in Reema Kagti's psychological thriller Talaash: The Answer Lies Within. Co-starring Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor, the film had worldwide earnings of over \u20b91.74 billion (US$27\u00a0million). Ronnie Schieb of Variety described Mukerji as \"vivid in a quietly sympathetic role\", and she received Best Supporting Actress nominations at several award ceremonies, including Filmfare. The following year, Mukerji starred in the anthology film Bombay Talkies consisting of four short films. Mukerji was part of the segment entitled Ajeeb Dastaan Hai Yeh in which she played Gayatri, a journalist who discovers that her husband (played by Randeep Hooda) is gay; it was her fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar. The film was screened at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival as part of the centenary year celebrations of Indian cinema. Despite poor box office returns, Bombay Talkies met with widespread critical acclaim, with praise directed to Johar's segment. Tushar Joshi of Daily News and Analysis said that Mukerji was successful in \"proving [that] she's the queen of subtlety when it comes to stripping off the make-up and letting herself fly\". In 2014, Mukerji appeared in Pradeep Sarkar's crime thriller Mardaani, in which she played the lead role of Shivani Shivaji Roy, a Maharashtrian policewoman involved in a kidnapping case that leads her to uncover secrets of human trafficking in India. She took on the role \"to show all girls what the reality is, what the world has come to, and how they need to protect themselves\". In preparation, she interacted with senior officials of Mumbai's crime branch, and learned the Israeli self-defense technique of Krav Maga. Rajeev Masand found Mukerji to be the prime asset of the film, adding that by \"investing Shivani with both physical strength and emotional courage, she gives us a hero that's hard not to root for\". Writing for Hindustan Times, Anupama Chopra also praised her performance, writing that she not only \"imbues Shivani with steely resolve but also gives her emotional depth\". The film was a commercial success and garnered Mukerji another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. After a three-year long sabbatical following the birth of her child, Mukerji will make her screen comeback with a leading role in the comedy-drama Hichki. Despite constant media attention, Mukerji remains guarded about her personal life. Unlike many other celebrities, Mukerji limits her interactions with the media and is sometimes labelled a recluse; she said in a 2011 interview, \"Today actors have become more open with the media. But this has posed a problem for actors like me because if I don't do that, then I end up being called reclusive. So now I have changed myself and am easily approachable.\" Mukerji has collaborated frequently and maintained a close friendship with actors Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, and filmmaker Karan Johar. The nature of Mukerji's relationship with filmmaker Aditya Chopra was the topic of fervent tabloid reporting in India, though she refused to publicly talk about it. On 21 April 2014, she married Chopra at a private ceremony in Italy. On 9 December 2015, she gave birth to their daughter, named Adira. Alongside her acting career, Mukerji has been actively involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. Mukerji was appointed as an ambassador by Procter & Gamble and the NGO Child Rights and You for their joint venture, Shiksha, to endorse the cause of children's education. In 2011 she set up a Stroke Treatment Fund, in association with the Indian Stroke Association, to pay for the treatment of financially deprived stroke-affected patients. Mukerji has made public appearances to support other charities and causes. In March 2004, she visited the Indian army unit in Pokhran, Rajasthan to interact with the jawan troops, for the NDTV reality show Jai Jawan. A decade later, in August 2014 she visited the jawans again at Baramulla. In February 2005, Mukerji and several other Bollywood actors participated in the 2005 HELP! Telethon Concert to raise money for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. In March 2006, Mukerji celebrated her birthday with the physically challenged children of the Helen Keller Institute; she had previously worked with them while preparing for her role in Black. In November 2010, she was part of a fund raising auction for the \"Because I am a Girl\" charity campaign. In 2014, Mukerji attended a charity dinner on child abuse in London, where she was felicitated by Prince Charles for raising awareness on the issue through her work in Mardaani. Mukerji has participated in several concert tours and televised award ceremonies. Her first concert tour, \"Magnificent Five\", was in 1999 in which she performed with actors Aamir Khan, Aishwarya Rai, Akshaye Khanna and Twinkle Khanna. The \"Temptations 2004\" concert had Mukerji perform alongside Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Preity Zinta, Arjun Rampal and Priyanka Chopra in nineteen stage shows worldwide. The following year, she participated in the \"Temptations 2005\" concert in New Delhi with Shah Rukh Khan, Fardeen Khan, Ameesha Patel and Malaika Arora Khan; the show was organised to help raise funds for the National Centre For Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP). In 2010, Mukerji performed at a concert in the Army Stadium of Dhaka, Bangladesh with several Bollywood actors including Shah Rukh Khan, Rampal and Ishaa Koppikar. For the \"Temptations Reloaded\" concert of 2012 in Jakarta, Mukerji performed alongside Shah Rukh Khan, Zinta and Bipasha Basu, for the 2013 concert of the same name in Auckland, she performed with Shah Rukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit and Jacqueline Fernandez, and in 2014 she performed in Malaysia with Shah Rukh Khan, Dixit, Yo Yo Honey Singh and Arijit Singh. Mukerji has been described by the critics as one of the most accomplished actresses of Bollywood. As part of a career analysis, Sukanya Verma noted that Mukerji made a \"rather unconventional debut in films\" (she played a rape victim in Raja Ki Aayegi Baarat), and after a few years of oscillating between success and failure, she \"achieved the status of a star, performer and showgirl\". Indo-Asian News Service reported that during her initial years in the industry, Mukerji was referred to as the successful Kajol's poor cousin and was written off by the critics for being \"plump\" and \"short\". Raja Sen added that despite the odds being against her, Mukerji \"slogged her way with grit\" and emerged as \"the most powerful leading lady in Bollywood\". Film critic Baradwaj Rangan of the New Sunday Express writes that Mukerji's unusual \"sandpaper-scratchy, I'm-recovering-from-a-bad-cold\" voice sets her apart from her contemporaries and The Times of India has credited her for breaking the \"fairness myth\" of Bollywood. Reema Kagti (the director of Talaash: The Answer Lies Within) said of Mukerji's craft, \"Rani likes to prepare a lot. She gets obsessive about the role and wants to know everything about her character. What's her character's back-story, what is going on in her head at a specific point\". In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Mukerji described her approach to acting: \"A month before I start shooting, I sit with my director, try to understand how he has visualised the character on the screen and take notes. Then I start working on the most basic thing\u00a0\u2014 the look. It's very important that the physical appearance of the character gets decided because if I look the character, it makes it all the more believable. Once that is achieved, I go into the finer nuances of what the girl is like, her background. And then from there [..] I have to get the accent right\". To avoid getting \"saturated\", Mukerji prefers portraying \"drastically different roles\", and is credited in the media as \"one of the most versatile actresses\" of Bollywood. She has played roles in both high-profile mainstream productions and lesser-publicised films of independent filmmakers; Hindustan Times published that Mukerji has made this progression so \"natural[ly] [..] that it's gone virtually unnoticed\". Namrata Joshi of Outlook adds that she is unafraid to take risks and portray roles that \"none of her contemporaries have been able to do\". Mukerji has garnered a reputation for playing roles that are a significant departure from the traditional portrayal of women in mainstream Indian cinema; in Hum Tum she played a widow who engages in pre-marital sex, in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna she is involved in an extra-marital affair with a married man, and in Bichhoo and No One Killed Jessica she smokes, drinks, and utters expletives. Mukerji is one of the best-known and most high-profile celebrities in India; at the peak of her career she was frequently listed as one of the most popular and attractive Indian celebrities, was one of the highest paid actresses in Bollywood, and the brand ambassador for a number of products. Filmfare featured her in their listing of the \"Ten Most Powerful Names of Bollywood\" for two consecutive years (2005\u20132006). In 2006, Eastern Eye ranked her as one of \"Asia's Sexiest Women\". Mukerji ranked first on Box Office India's '\"Top Actresses\" listing for two consecutive years (2005\u20132006). She topped Rediff.com's annual listing of the \"Top Bollywood Actresses\" for three consecutive years (2004\u20132006); in 2007, she held the fifth position. She was also featured by Rediff.com in their listing of \"Bollywood's Best Actresses Ever\", \"Bollywood's Most Beautiful Actresses\", and \"Bollywood's Best Dressed Women\". Since 2007, Mukerji's popularity was on a decline and she lost out on her brand endorsements to a number of younger actresses. In 2013, the American Embassy in India honoured her with a special trophy for her contributions to Indian cinema.

        "artist_name": "Ranveer_Singh", 
        "biography": " Ranveer Singh Bhavnani (born 6 July 1985) is an Indian film actor who appears in Hindi films. After completing a bachelor's degree from Indiana University Bloomington, Singh returned to India to pursue a career in film. He made his acting debut in 2010 with a leading role in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Band Baaja Baaraat. The film emerged as a critical and commercial success, earning Singh a Filmfare Award in the Best Male Debut category. Singh went on to star in the romantic drama Lootera (2013), Sanjay Leela Bhansali's tragic romance Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela (2013), his biggest commercial successes to that point, and in the action-drama Gunday (2014). In 2015, he starred in the ensemble comedy-drama Dil Dhadakne Do (2015), and portrayed Bajirao in Bajirao Mastani, one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films, for which he garnered critical acclaim and won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.   Singh was born on 6 July 1985 into a Sindhi Sikh family in Mumbai, to Anju and Jagjit Singh Bhavnani. His grandparents, Sunder Singh Bhavnani and Chand Burke, moved to Mumbai from Karachi, Sindh, during the Partition of India. He has an elder sister named Ritika Bhavnani. Singh is the maternal cousin of actress Sonam Kapoor and producer Rhea Kapoor, daughters of actor Anil Kapoor and wife Sunita Kapoor (n\u00e9e Bhavnani). Singh explains that he dropped his surname Bhavnani, since he felt that the name would have been \"too long, too many syllables\", thus downplaying his brand as a \"saleable commodity\". Singh always aspired to be an actor, participating in several school plays and debates. Once when he had gone for a birthday party, his grandmother asked him to dance and entertain her. Singh remembers that he suddenly jumped in the lawn and started dancing to the song \"Chumma Chumma\" from the 1991 action film, Hum. He felt the thrill of performing and was interested in acting and dancing. However, after he joined H.R. College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai, Singh realised that getting a break in the film industry was not at all easy, as it was mostly people with a film background who got these opportunities. Feeling that the idea of acting was \"too far-fetched\", Singh focused on creative writing. He went to the United States where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Indiana University. At university, he decided to take acting classes and took up theatre as his minor. After completing his studies and returning to Mumbai in 2007, Singh worked for a few years in advertising as a copywriter, with agencies like O&M and J. Walter Thompson. He then worked as an assistant director, but left it to pursue acting. He decided to send his portfolio to directors. He would go for all kinds of auditions, but did not get any good opportunities, while only getting calls for minor roles: \"Everything was so bleak. It was very frustrating. There were times I would think whether I was doing the right thing or not.\" In January 2010, Singh was called for an audition by Shanoo Sharma, the head of the casting division for Yash Raj Films. They informed him that it was for a lead role in their film titled Band Baaja Baaraat, a romantic comedy set in the world of wedding planning. Aditya Chopra, the vice president of the company, later saw the audition tapes on video and was impressed by Singh's acting, and decided that he fit the part of Bittoo Sharma, the hero of the film. However, the director Maneesh Sharma needed some more convincing and he was called for a few more auditions over the next two weeks until they were completely convinced of his caliber. After the two weeks of testing, Singh was confirmed for the role of Bittoo, with Anushka Sharma playing the female lead. Singh described the role of Bittoo Sharma as a typical Delhi boy. To prepare for the role, he spent time with students at the Delhi University campus. Prior to the release of the film, trade analysts were skeptical of the film's commercial potential, citing the middling response to Yash Raj Films' last few productions, the lack of a male star and the fact that the female lead, Anushka Sharma, was by then an \"almost-forgotten\" actress. However, Band Baaja Baaraat went on to become a sleeper hit. Singh's portrayal of Bittoo was praised, with Anupama Chopra of NDTV writing that Singh was \"pitch perfect in the role of the uncouth but good-hearted small town slacker who is a bit of a duffer when it comes to matters of the heart. The film earned approximately \u20b9214 million (US$3.3\u00a0million) at the domestic box office. At the 56th Filmfare Awards, Singh won the award for Best Male Debut. Following Band Baaja Baarat, Singh signed on for Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, a romantic comedy produced by Chopra and directed by Maneesh Sharma. He played a conman Ricky Bahl who cons girls for a living but finally meets his match. The film co-starred Anushka Sharma, Parineeti Chopra, Dipannita Sharma and Aditi Sharma. According to Singh, the title character had various avatars in the film, including a chirpy, entertaining side and a sinister side. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India wrote, \"Ranveer is, well Ranveer: your average Joe kind of hero who looks convincing enough as Sunny, Deven, Iqbal, Ricky, his sundry avatars.\" Commercially, Ladies vs Ricky Bahl earned \u20b9370 million (US$5.7\u00a0million) domestically. Singh's next release was Lootera (2013), a period romance, written and directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, and co-starring Sonakshi Sinha. An adaptation of O. Henry's short story The Last Leaf, Lootera was critically acclaimed. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN wrote that Singh \"brings a quiet sensitivity to Varun, and occasionally a smoldering intensity. Offering a finely internalized performance, he leaves a lasting impression.\" However, Lootera performed poorly at the box office. Singh next starred opposite Deepika Padukone in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, entitled Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, in which he played Ram, a Gujarati boy based on the character of Romeo. Bhansali was impressed by Singh's performance in Band Baaja Baaraat and decided to cast him for the film. Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela generated positive reviews from critics, as did Singh's performance. Writing for India Today, Rohit Khilnani commented that \"Singh has everything going for him here. His Bollywood hero entry scene lying down on a bike in the song 'Tattad Tattad' is outstanding. He learnt a new language to better his performance for the character Ram and it paid off. In his fourth film he has the presence of a star.\" The film emerged as Singh's biggest commercial success, with worldwide revenues of \u20b92.02 billion (US$31\u00a0million). For his portrayal, he received several recognitions, including a Best Actor nomination at Filmfare. In 2014, Singh starred as a Bengali criminal in Ali Abbas Zafar's Gunday, alongside Arjun Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra and Irrfan Khan. David Chute of Variety praised Singh's screen presence and wrote that he \"tucks the movie's center of interest under his arm and takes it with him \u2014 even though he has the could-be-thankless \"good brother\" role\". Also, Singh's chemistry with Kapoor was considered by critic Rohit Khilnani to the prime asset of the film. Gunday proved to be Singh's biggest box office opener, and eventually emerged a box-office success with a revenue of \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide. After a cameo appearance in Finding Fanny, Singh starred as a gangster in Shaad Ali's unsuccessful crime drama Kill Dil opposite Parineeti Chopra and Ali Zafar and received negative reviews. In Zoya Akhtar's ensemble comedy-drama Dil Dhadakne Do (2015), Singh starred with Anil Kapoor, Shefali Shah and Priyanka Chopra as the younger sibling of a dysfunctional Punjabi family. Writing for Mumbai Mirror, critic Kunal Guha found Singh to be the \"surprise element\" of the film; he praised his \"immaculate comic timing\" and particularly noted on the subtelty of his performance. The film further was an economic success, grossing \u20b91.47 billion (US$23\u00a0million) worldwide within seventeen days of release. Singh next reunited with Sanjay Leela Bhansali for the epic romance Bajirao Mastani (2015) opposite Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra. He portrayed Bajirao I, for which he shaved his head and locked himself up in a hotel room for 21 days. Raja Sen in his review mentioned: \"Ranveer Singh brings his character to life and does so with both machismo and grace, his Peshwa Bajirao slicing down soldiers like a lehnga-clad golfer wielding a too-sharp niblick. The film was a box-office success and Singh won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 2016, Singh appeared in Aditya Chopra's comedy-romance Befikre opposite Vaani Kapoor. In the film, he played Dharam Gulati, a flirtatious Delhi boy. Set in Paris, Befikre marked the fourth project to be directed by Chopra. As of November 2016, Singh is filming for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's historical drama Padmavati, co-starring Shahid Kapoor and Deepika Padukone, in which he will play the tyrannical ruler Alauddin Khilji. In addition, Singh has committed to star opposite Alia Bhatt in Zoya Akhtar's Gully Boy, a musical based on the life of rappers living in Mumbai's ghettos. In addition to his acting career, Ranveer Singh has endorsed 17 brands, including Adidas, Head & Shoulders, Ching's, Jack & Jones, Thums Up and Kellogg Oats. Singh is the recipient of two Filmfare Awards: Best Male Debut for Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) and Best Actor for Bajirao Mastani (2016). He has received an additional Best Actor nomination at the ceremony for Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela (2013)."

        "artist_name": "Rati_Agnihotri", 
        "biography": " Rati Agnihotri (born 10 December 1960 in Bareilly) is a veteran Indian actress. Her portfolio mainly includes films in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada.   Agnihotri was born in Bareilly Uttar Pradesh in a Punjabi family. She had her first modelling stint at age 10. When she was a teenager, her father relocated the family to Madras, Tamil Nadu because of his job. There, she attended Good Shepherd's Convent School and acted in a school play. Bharathiraja, one of Tamil cinema's prominent directors, was in the audience and was searching for a heroine to star in his new film. He met with Rati's father and promised the film would wrap in a month. Her father reluctantly agreed, and a sixteen-year-old Rati was very excited to star in her first film, Puthiya Vaarpugal (1979). It was also her hero Bhagyaraj's first film, and he coached her with her lines by teaching her Tamil. The film became a blockbuster, with Rati an overnight sensation. Bharathiraj soon directed her in her second film, Niram Maaratha Pookkal (1979). Even though she was Punjabi, South Indian audiences embraced her as one of their own. She reciprocated by calling herself \"Tamilian at heart\" and calling Madras her home. She also starred in Telugu and Kannada films and made 32 films in just three years. She is popular in Karnataka due to her hot rain songs with Vishnuvardhan that are frequently shown in the Midnight Masala TV program. She worked with big banners and top stars in South Indian cinema. She had worked with director K. Balachander once before and had been Kamal Hassan's leading lady in many South Indian films, so she wasn't surprised when they approached her for the Hindi remake of their Telugu blockbuster Maro Charithra (1979). Now re-titled Ek Duuje Ke Liye (1981), the film was about passionate lovers who are torn apart by their parents in the storytelling tradition of Romeo and Juliet. It became one of the top grossing hits of 1981 and marked the debut into Hindi films of five stars of the South Indian film industry: director K. Balachander, hero Kamal Hassan, heroine Rati Agnihotri, singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam and supporting actress Madhavi. She then starred in over 43 Hindi films. Her biggest hits were Farz Aur Kanoon (1982), Coolie (1983) opposite megastar Amitabh Bachchan, Tawaif (1985) for which she received her second Filmfare nomination as Best Actress, and Hukumat (1987) opposite the Bollywood icon Dharmendra. Rati's marriage to businessman and architect Anil Virwani on 9 February 1985, coupled with her father's death, convinced Rati to leave Hindi films when she was at the top. On 28 November 1986, she gave birth to her only son, Tanuj Virwani, and she concentrated on raising him and focusing on other creative interests like architectural creations for her husband. In 2015, she separated from Virwani after thirty years of marriage. After 16 years of saying no to films, Rati finally said yes realizing that her son is growing up and she had more time for herself. Her family supported her decision. Her comeback started with playing Kajol's glamorous mother in Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi (2001). More film offers came in, and she took them, such as Yaadein (2001) and Dev (2004). After a 20-year absence from South Indian films, she returned in the Tamil film Majunu (2001). She made her Malayalam debut in Anyar (2003), English debut in An Ode to Lost Love (2003), and Bengali debut in Aaina-te (2008). She has acted on stage in plays such as Please Divorce Me Darling (2005) and television serials, such as Sixer (2005). Besides acting, she devotes time to social causes like cancer and AIDS. Her son Tanuj Virwani followed in her footsteps by becoming an actor. She has acted in ten languages, including, but not limited to Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Punjabi and English. Her cousin is actor-writer-director Atul Agnihotri, and she played a part of a cardiac surgeon in his film Dil Ne Jise Apna Kahaa (2004). In 2006, Rati and her husband opened a shopping mall called Virwani Plaza in Pune, where one of the stores, Om to Home\u00a0\u2013 Candles and More in the Mall, houses artefacts, exclusive fashion accessories, and candles all personally designed by the actress. Rati played Nayantara Pratap Singh in a serial named Kaajjal on SET Asia. She recently quit the show because of problems with the production company. She was a contestant on dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa in the 1st season in 2006. Her sister Anita Agnihotri (Miss India) lives in Szczecin, Poland and owns an Indian restaurant, \"Bombay\". Her son Tanuj Virvani made his debut with Luv U Soniyo which released July 2013."

During the 1990s, she was part of several commercial successes such as Dilwale (1994), Mohra (1994), Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi (1996) and Ziddi (1997), among others. Despite attaining popularity, her main successful period evolved in the early 2000s (decade), when she ventured into more serious roles and turned towards arthouse and parallel cinema. She got high critical acclaim for her performances in films like Aks (2001), Satta (2003), Shool (1999), and Sandhya (2002). She was at the peak of her career in 2002, when she won the National Film Award for Best Actress for her performance in Kalpana Lajmi's Daman: A Victim of Marital Violence (2001). She had established herself as a leading actress of Bollywood. She was a commercial successful actress of her time . She Rose to prominence in early 2000s.

She will be next seen in the thriller movie \"Maatr\" .   Tandon attended Jamnabai Narsee School in Juhu and studied at Mithibai College. She completed her first and second years at the college. During her time as an intern, she got her first film offer from Shantanu Sheorey which she accepted. She dropped out of college and decided to pursue her film career. Her father was a producer and directed some films in the 1970s and 1980s. She has a brother named Rajeev Tandon, who had a brief career in Bollywood films. Her cousin, Kiran Rathod, is also an Indian actress. Her first cousin, Manjari Makijany is a writer and director of Hindi films and American films. Her other cousin Reshma Singh, acted in television serials. A third cousin, Vishal Singh, is an actor for television serials. Raveena Tandon debuted with the film Patthar Ke Phool (1991) which was a hit; she received the Filmfare Award for Lux New Face of the Year for her performance. Her next films Mohra (1994) and Dilwale (1994) were big hits at the box. Laadla (1994) earned her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Mohra was the second biggest hit of 1994. Her other releases of that year included the thriller Imtihaan and the 1994 cult-classic comedy Andaz Apna Apna with Aamir Khan, Salman Khan and Karisma Kapoor. The former was also a hit. She had to wait for one year to get her film Patthar Ke Phool released though her first movie Anjaane (1991 and 1994) was shelved twice due to contract conflicts between Ultra videos and Moser baer. In 1995, she starred with Shahrukh Khan for the first time in Zamaana Deewana; the film failed to do well. Her next few films also failed to do well at the box office and her career saw a drop in her success as she apparently did not show any interest in doing more movies following her engagement with actor Akshay Kumar. She stopped working during this period due to personal problems and rejected many lucrative big budgeted movie offers that later went on to be blockbusters. Her career was back on track with hit films like Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi (1996) and Ziddi (1997), both being big hits each of its respective year. In 1997, she was to play her first villainous role in Dus but the film was shelved after the director's death when 40% of the film's shooting had been completed. She was also offered the 2nd lead in blockbuster movies Dil to Pagal Hai(1997) and Gupt (1997), but declined both movies as she had taken a sabbatical at the time. She also left another superhit, the Anil Kapoor-starrer Virasat (1997). Had she done all these movies she would have been the most successful actress of that time. In 1998, Tandon had eight releases. Her last release of that year, Bade Miyan Chote Miyan, co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda turned out to the second biggest hit of the year. Tandon was offered the second lead in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai which went on to be the biggest hit of 1998, but she turned it down. Her other releases of that year were Gharwali Baharwali which gained a below average status, Vinashak, Pardesi Babu and Aunty No. 1, all of which were unsuccessful. In 1999, Tandon starred opposite Upendra in his self-titled Kannada psychological thriller film, Upendra. In the 2000s (decade), Tandon turned her career professionally. She went on to work more with art film directors and realistic cinema. It proved to be a good turning as films like Shool (1999), Bulandi (2000) and Aks (2001) won her huge acclaim. She won many awards as well as the Filmfare Special Performance Award for her performance in Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's Aks. Her years in the industry paid off when she won the coveted National Film Award for Best Actress for her performance in Kalpana Lajmi's Daman: A Victim of Marital Violence (2001), where she played a battered wife to an abusive husband. She surprised critics and audiences with her performance in the film and received much appreciation for her work. Critic, Taran Adarsh said, \"Raveena Tandon lends credibility to the role of a battered wife and walks away with the honours. The pathos she conveys through her expressions makes you realise that she's a performer of substance\". Since then, she has starred in a number of critically acclaimed films, such as Satta (2003) and Dobara (2004), but has not had much box office success. Her role as a middle class woman thrust into the world of politics in the former was praised. Critic, Taran Adarsh wrote, \"Raveena Tandon delivers a bravura performance. The actress takes giant strides as a performer, giving the right touches to her character. Here's a performance that's bound to be noticed\". Her role as a schizophrenic in Dobara was also praised with one critic saying, \"Raveena is in sync with her character, playing her part with elaan\". Her only release in 2006 was Sandwich which opened to poor reviews and reception. Tandon has also produced the films Stumped (2003) and Pehchaan: The Face of Truth (2005), neither of which had much success at the box office. Comeback (2015-present ) In 2015, she made a comeback to Bollywood in longtime friend Anurag Kashayp's magnum opus Bombay Velvet. Playing a sultry jazz singer, her brief performance was lauded by critics. She is currently filming Onir's Shab, where she plays a socialite. In addition, she has also reportedly committed to Anurag Kashyap's Return Gift. She will be next seen in the thriller movie \"Maatr\". She adopted two girls, Pooja and Chhaya, as a single mother in 1995 when they were 11 and 8 years old, respectively. Tandon began dating film distributor Anil Thadani during the making of her film Stumped (2003). Their engagement was announced in November 2003. She married Thadani on 22 February 2004 in Jag Mandir Palace in Udaipur, Rajasthan according to Punjabi traditions. She gave birth to a baby girl named Rasha on 16 March 2005 and had her second child, a baby boy named Ranbir, on 12 July 2007. Tandon was chairperson of the Children's Film Society of India from 2003, but from 2004 the actress began to get complaints that she did not attend the organisation's meetings and that she was not involved with the activities set up by the society. In September 2005, Tandon resigned from her post citing personal reasons. In November 2005, Tandon sued the websites, Shaadi.com and Shaaditimes.com, claiming that they were using unauthorized images of her to promote the site. She also sued the owner Satyanet Solutions, as they claimed that Tandon and her husband had met through the website. In November 2002, Tandon sang on to support the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. She has posed in many advertisement campaigns joining the likes of Shilpa Shetty, Amisha Patel and John Abraham. On the issue of cows being slaughtered for their skin, she said \"their abuse at the hands of corrupt skin and meat traders must be stopped\"."

        "artist_name": "Rekha", 
        "biography": " Bhanurekha Ganesan (born 10 October 1954), better known by her stage name Rekha, is an Indian film actress. Noted for her versatility and acknowledged as one of the finest actresses in Hindi cinema, Rekha started her career in 1966 as a child actress in the Telugu film Rangula Ratnam, though her film debut as a lead happened four years later with Sawan Bhadon. Despite the success of several of her early films, she was often panned for her looks and it was not until the mid-to-late 1970s that she got recognition as an actress. Rekha has acted in over 180 films in a career spanning over 40 years. Throughout her career, she has often played strong female characters and, apart from mainstream cinema, appeared in arthouse films, known in India as parallel cinema. She has won three Filmfare Awards, two for Best Actress and one for Best Supporting Actress, for her roles in Khubsoorat (1980), Khoon Bhari Maang (1988) and Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi (1996), respectively. Her portrayal of a classical courtesan in Umrao Jaan (1981) won her the National Film Award for Best Actress. Though her career has gone through certain periods of decline, she has reinvented herself numerous times and has been credited for her ability to sustain her status. In 2010, she was honoured with the Padma Shri by the Government of India.   Rekha was born in Chennai (then Madras) to Tamil actor Gemini Ganesan and Telugu actress Pushpavalli. Her father enjoyed considerable success as an actor and Rekha was to follow in his footsteps. She is an alumnus of the popular Church Park Convent in Chennai. She considers Telugu to be her mother tongue. She also speaks Hindi, Tamil and English fluently. Her parents were not married at the time of her birth, and her father did not acknowledge his paternity during her childhood. Rekha has one full sister, one half brother and five half sisters. It was in early 1970s, when she was looking for a footing in Bollywood, that she revealed her origins. Later, at the peak of her career, Rekha told a magazine interviewer that father's neglect still rankled and that she had ignored his efforts at reconciliation. Rekha quit school to start a career in acting. She did not have any personal aspirations in this direction, but the troubled financial state of her family compelled her to do so. Rekha appeared as a child (credited as Baby Bhanurekha) in the Telugu film Rangula Ratnam (1966). Rekha made her debut as heroine in the successful Kannada film Operation Jackpot Nalli C.I.D 999 with Rajkumar in 1969. In that same year, she starred in her first Hindi film, Anjana Safar. She later claimed that she was tricked into a kissing scene with the leading actor Biswajit for the overseas market, and the kiss made it to the Asian edition of Life magazine. The film ran into censorship problems, and would not be released until almost a decade later in 1979 (retitled as Do Shikaari). She had no interest in acting and was basically forced to work to sustain her family financially, this was a difficult period in her life. Still a teenager, acclimatising herself to her new surroundings was an uneasy process. Coming from the South, she did not speak Hindi and struggled to communicate with co-workers, and was constantly missing her mother, who was critically ill. Moreover, she was required to follow a strict diet. Recalling this phase, Rekha was later quoted as saying (Reacting to it, many years later, she said, \"I'm healed, I am not bitter anymore, I don't think I ever was.\"), She had two films released in 1970: the Telugu film Amma Kosam and the Hindi film Sawan Bhadon, which was considered her acting debut in Bollywood. She had to learn Hindi, as that was not her naturally spoken language. Sawan Bhadon became a hit, and Rekha \u2013 a star overnight. Despite the success of the film, she was often scorned for her looks. She subsequently got several offers but nothing of substance, as her roles were mostly just of a glamour girl. She appeared in several commercially successful films at the time, including Raampur Ka Lakshman (1972), Kahani Kismat Ki (1973), and Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye (1974), yet she was not regarded for her acting abilities and\u2014according to Tejaswini Ganti\u2014\"the industry was surprised by her success as her dark complexion, plump figure, and garish clothing contradicted the norms of beauty prevalent in the film industry and in society.\" Rekha recalls that the way she was perceived at that time motivated her to change her appearance and improve her choice of roles: \"I was called the \u2018Ugly Duckling\u2019 of Hindi films because of my dark complexion and South Indian features. I used to feel deeply hurt when people compared me with the leading heroines of the time and said I was no match for them. I was determined to make it big on sheer merit.\" This period marked the beginning of Rekha's physical transformation. She started paying attention to her make-up, dress sense, and worked to improve her acting technique and perfect her Hindi-language skills. To lose weight, she followed a nutritious diet, led a regular, disciplined life, and practised yoga, later recording albums to promote physical fitness. According to Khalid Mohamed, \"The audience was floored when there was a swift change in her screen personality, as well as her style of acting.\" She began choosing her film roles with more care; her first performance-oriented role came in 1976 when she played Amitabh Bachchan's ambitious and greedy wife in Do Anjaane. An adaptation of Nihar Ranjan Gupta's Bengali novel Ratrir Yatri, the film was directed by Dulal Guha and became a reasonable success with audiences and critics. Her most significant turning point, however, came in 1978, with her portrayal of a rape victim in the movie Ghar. She played the role of Aarti, a newly married woman who gets gravely traumatised after being gang-raped. The film follows her character's struggle and recuperation with the help of her loving husband, played by Vinod Mehra. The film was considered her first notable milestone, and her performance was applauded by both critics and audiences. Dinesh Raheja from Rediff, in an article discussing her career, remarked, \"Ghar heralded the arrival of a mature Rekha. Her archetypal jubilance was replaced by her very realistic portrayal...\" She received her first nomination for Best Actress at the Filmfare Awards. In that same year, she attained fame with Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, in which she co-starred once again with Amitabh Bachchan. The movie was the biggest hit of that year, as well as one of the biggest hits of the decade, and Rekha was set as one of the most successful actresses of these times. The film opened to a positive critical reception, and Rekha's performance as a courtesan named Zohra, noted for a \"smouldering intensity\", earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Filmfare. In 1980, Rekha appeared in the comedy Khubsoorat, directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, with whom she had developed a strong father-daughter bond during their previous collaborations. In a role written specially for her, she played Manju Dayal, a young vivacious woman who visits her recently married sister at her in-law's house and tries to bring joy to the wide family, much to the displeasure of the matriarch of the household. Rekha said she easily identified with the bubbly nature of her character, calling it \"quite a bit me\". Khubsoorat was a success and Rekha was appreciated for her comic timing. It won the Filmfare Award for Best Film and Rekha won her first Best Actress award. The Tribune described the film as \"a lively comedy,\" noting that \"Rekha's spunky performance gives the film its natural zing.\" Film World magazine reported in that same year, \"Rekha's done it. Smoothly, successfully. From a plump, pelvis-jerking, cleavage-flashing temptress, she has metamorphosed into a sleek, accomplished actress. Gone are most of the inane mannerisms, pouts, wiggles and giggles.\" It further noted that her career prospects had begun to improve significantly, as leading filmmakers had started taking more notice of her and become more keen to cast her in their films. Rekha went on to star opposite Bachchan in a number of films, most of which were hits. She also had an alleged off-screen relationship with him, which was widely reported on in the media, as well as sharply criticised, as he was a married man. This relationship ended in 1981, when they starred in Yash Chopra's drama Silsila. The film was the most scandalous of their films together; Rekha played Bachchan's love interest, while Bachchan's real-life wife, Jaya Bhaduri, played his wife. This was their last film together. Critics noted Rekha for having worked hard to perfect her Hindi and acting, and media reporters often discussed how she had transformed herself from a \"plump\" duckling to a \"swan\" in the early 1970s. Rekha's credits to this transformation were yoga, a nutritious diet, and a regular, disciplined life. In 1983, her diet and yoga practice were published in a book called \"Rekha's Mind and Body Temple\". In 1981, she starred in Umrao Jaan, a film adaptation of the Urdu novel Umrao Jaan Ada (1905), written by Mirza Hadi Ruswa. Rekha played the title role of a courtesan and poet from 19th century Lucknow. The film follows Umrao's life story right from her days as a young girl named Amiran when she is kidnapped and sold in a brothel. Rekha once confessed, \"After reading the script, I had a strange feeling that I had Umrao in me.\" In preparation for the role, Rekha, who at the beginning of her career did not speak Hindi, took the task of learning the finer nuances of the Urdu language. Director Muzaffar Ali later noted that \"Rekha has given more than my conception of the role.\" The response to her work was universally positive. Her portrayal is considered to be one of her career-best performances, and she was awarded the National Film Award for Best Actress for it. She played a courtesan with a heart of gold in several of her films; Muqaddar Ka Sikandar and Umrao Jaan were followed by a number of films which had her playing similar roles. In that same year, Rekha starred in Ramesh Talwar's family drama Baseraa, which saw her playing a woman who marries her sister's husband, after the latter loses her mental balance. She appeared as Sadhna in the commercially successful Ek Hi Bhool (1981), opposite Jeetendra, playing the role of a betrayed wife who leaves her husband. In 1982, she received another Filmfare nomination for Jeevan Dhaara, in which she played a young unmarried woman who is the sole breadwinner of her extended family. In 1983, she took the supporting role of a lawyer in Mujhe Insaaf Chahiye, garnering another Filmfare nomination in the Supporting Actress category. During this period, Rekha was willing to expand her range beyond what she was given in mainstream films. She started working in arthouse pictures with independent directors, mostly under Shashi Kapoor's production, in what was used to be referred to as parallel cinema, an Indian New Wave movement known for its serious content and neo-realism. Her venture into this particular genre started off with Umrao Jaan, and was followed by other such films as Shyam Benegal's award-winning drama, Kalyug (1981), Govind Nihalani's Vijeta (1982), Girish Karnad's Utsav (1984) and Gulzar's Ijaazat (1987), among others. Benegal's Kalyug is a modern-day adaptation of the Indian mythological epic Mahabharat, depicted as an archetypal-conflict between rival business houses. Rekha's role was that of Supriya, a character based on Draupadi. Benegal said he decided to cast her in the role after seeing her work in Khubsoorat, besides noticing that she was \"very keen, very serious about her profession\". Critic and author Vijay Nair described her performance as \"a masterful interpretation of the modern Draupadi\". In Vijeta she played a woman who struggles through her marital problems and tries to support her adolescent son, who, undecided about his future plans, eventually decides to join the Indian Air Force. She described her performance in the film as one of her favourite from her own repertoire. For her portrayal of Vasantsena in Utsav, an erotic comedy based on the fourth-century Sanskrit play Mrichhakatika (The Little Clay Cart), she was acknowledged as the Best Actress (Hindi) of the year by the Bengal Film Journalists' Association. Maithili Rao wrote for \"Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema\", \"Rekha \u2013 forever the first choice for the courtesan's role, be it ancient Hindu India or 19th-century Muslim Lucknow \u2013 is all statuesque sensuality...\" In Gulzar's drama Ijaazat, Rekha and Naseeruddin Shah star as a divorced couple who meet unexpectedly for the first time after years of separation at a railway station, and recall together their life as a married couple and the conflicts which brought to their ultimate split. Apart from parallel cinema, Rekha took on other increasingly serious, even adventurous roles; she was among the early actresses to play lead roles in heroine-oriented films, one such film being Khoon Bhari Maang in 1988. She won her second Filmfare Award for her performance in the film. Rekha went on to describe Khoon Bhari Maang as \"the first and only film I concentrated and understood all throughout.\" One critic wrote about her performance in the film, \"Rekha as Aarti is just flawless and this is one of her best performances ever! In the first half as the shy and not so sexy Aarti she is excellent and after the plastic surgery as the model and femme fatale she is excellent too. Some scenes show that we are watching an actress of a very high calibre here.\" M.L. Dhawan from The Tribune, while documenting the famous Hindi films of 1988, remarked that Khoon Bhari Maang was \"a crowning glory for Rekha, who rose like a phoenix ... and bedazzled the audience with her daredevilry.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's Encyclop\u00e6dia of Hindi Cinema listed her role in the film as one of Hindi cinema's memorable female characters, noting it for changing \"the perception of the ever-forgiving wife, turning her into an avenging angel.\" In a similar list by Screen magazine, the role was included as one of \"ten memorable roles that made the Hindi film heroine proud.\" In later interviews, Rekha often described the moment she received the Filmfare Award for this role as a turning point, explaining that only then did she start genuinely enjoying her work and seeing it as more than \"just a job\": \"...when I went up on the stage, and received my award for Khoon Bhari Maang... Boom, it hit me! That's the first time I realised the value of being an actor and how much this profession meant to me.\" In 2011 she further stated, \"I felt even more charged to give my best and knew right then, that this was my calling, what I was born to do, to make a difference in people's lives, through my performances.\" The 1990s saw a drop in Rekha's success. Few of her films were successful and many of her roles were condemned by reviewers. Critics did note, however, that unlike most of the actresses of her generation, like Hema Malini and Raakhee, who succumbed to playing character parts, typically of mothers and aunts, Rekha was still playing leading roles at a time when younger female stars rose to fame. The first year of the decade saw four releases featuring Rekha, including Mera Pati Sirf Mera Hai and Amiri Garibi, all of which went unnoticed. Still recovering from the recent suicide of her husband and struggling with the ensuing press antagonism towards her, Rekha retained considerable success with her starring role as Namrata Singh, a young woman who joins the police force to avenge her husband's death in K. C. Bokadia's Phool Bane Angaray (1991). The film was a box-office hit and Rekha received a Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her work, in reference to which Subhash K. Jha remarked, \"Khaki never seemed sexier\". The public's acceptance of this film and Khoon Bhari Maang prompted several filmmakers to come with similar offers to Rekha, and she played such roles\u2014labeled \"avenging angels\"\u2014in several of her proceeding projects to a much less consequential effect. These included her next film Insaaf Ki Devi (1992), and later films such as Ab Insaf Hoga (1995) and Udaan (1997), all of which were major duds. She followed with a dual role of twin sisters in Shakti Samanta's Geetanjali opposite Jeetendra and the title role in the box-office disaster Madam X, in which she starred as a young woman hired by the police to impersonate a female underworld don. Halfway through the decade, Rekha managed to halt her decline when she accepted several highly-controversial films, including Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love and Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi (1996). Kama Sutra, a foreign production directed by Mira Nair, was an erotic drama and many felt it would damage Rekha's career, as Rekha played a Kama Sutra teacher in the film. Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi, an action film directed by Umesh Mehra, was a major financial success, becoming one of the highest-grossing Indian films of the year. It featured Rekha in her first negative role as Madam Maya, a vicious gangster woman running a secret business of illegal wrestling matches in the US, who, during the course of the film, romances the much younger Akshay Kumar. Her portrayal earned her several awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Star Screen Award for Best Villain. In spite of the positive response to her performance from both fans and critics, she maintained on more than one occasion that she did not like herself in the film, noting that her work was not up to her own, personal standards. Another controversial film at that time was Aastha: In the Prison of Spring (1997), where Basu Bhattacharya, making the last film of his career, cast her as a housewife who moonlights as a prostitute. While her performance earned her positive notices and a Star Screen Award nomination, she was criticised by the audience for the nature of the part, to which she later replied, \"...people had a lot to say about my role... I don't have problems playing anything. I've reached a stage where I could do justice to any role that came my way. It could be role of a mother, a sister-in-law; negative, positive, sensational or anything.\" In the 2000s, Rekha appeared in relatively few movies. She started the decade with Bulandi, directed by Rama Rao Tatineni. The other was Khalid Muhammad's Zubaidaa, co starring Karisma Kapoor and Manoj Vajapayee playing the first wife Maharani Mandira Devi of the King. In 2001, Rekha appeared in Rajkumar Santoshi's feminist drama Lajja, an ensemble piece inspired by a true incident of a woman being raped in Bawanipur two years before. The film follows the journey of a runaway wife (Manisha Koirala) and unfolds her story in three main chapters, each one presenting the story of a woman at whose place she stops. Rekha was the protagonist of the final chapter, around which the film's inspiration revolves, playing Ramdulari, an oppressed Dalit village woman and social activist who becomes a victim of gangrape. Speaking of the film, Rekha commented, \"I am Lajja and Lajja is me\". Highly praised for her portrayal, she received several nominations for her work, including a Best Supporting Actress nomination at Filmfare. Taran Adarsh wrote that \"it is Rekha who walks away with the glory, delivering one of the finest performances the Indian screen has seen in the recent times.\" In Rakesh Roshan's science-fiction film Koi... Mil Gaya, Rekha played Sonia Mehra, a single mother to a developmentally disabled young man, played by Hrithik Roshan. The movie was a financial and critical success and became the most popular film of the year; it won the Filmfare Award for Best Film, among others. Rekha received another Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Filmfare for her performance, which Khalid Mohamed described as \"astutely restrained\". In 2005, Rekha guest starred in an item number in connection with the song \"Kaisi Paheli Zindagani\", in Pradeep Sarkar's \"Parineeta\". In Bachke Rehna Re Baba (2005), Rekha played a con woman who, along with her niece, uses one scheme to rob men of their property. The film was a major critical failure. Mid Day remarked, \"why Rekha chose to sign this film is a wonder,\" noting that she is \"riddled with bad dialogue, terrible cakey makeup and tawdry styling\". This was followed in 2006 by Kudiyon Ka Hai Zamana, a poorly received sex comedy about four female friends and their personal troubles. In a scathing review, Indu Mirani noted that \"Rekha hams like she was never going to do another film.\" In a 2007 article by Daily News and Analysis, critic Deepa Gahlot directed an advice to Rekha: \"Please pick movies with care, one more like Bach Ke Rehna Re Baba and Kudiyon Ka Hai Zamana and the diva status is under serious threat.\" In 2006, she reprised the role of Sonia Mehra in Krrish, Rakesh Roshan's sequel to Koi... Mil Gaya. In this superhero feature, the story moves 20 years forward and focuses on the character of Sonia's grandson Krishna (played again by Hrithik Roshan), whom she has brought up single-handedly after the death of her son Rohit, and who turns out to have supernatural powers. Krrish became the second-highest grossing picture of the year and, like its prequel, was declared a blockbuster. It received mostly positive notices from critics, and Rekha's work earned her another Filmfare nomination in the supporting category. Ronnie Scheib from Variety noted her for bringing \"depth to her role as the nurturing grandmother\". In 2007, she once again portrayed a courtesan in Goutam Ghose's Yatra. Unlike the initial success she experienced in playing such roles in the early stages of her career, this time the film failed to do well. In 2010, Rekha was awarded the Padma Shri, the 4th highest civilian award given by the Government of India. Rekha has also been nominated as a Rajya Sabha member. She currently is the member of the Rajya Sabha (May 2012). Rekha starred in the 2010 film Sadiyaan alongside Hema Malini and Rishi Kapoor. The film marked the debut of Shatrughan Sinha's son Luv Sinha. The film failed to do well at the box office. In 2014, Rekha was working on Abhishek Kapoor's Fitoor, but left the film due to unknown reasons and later Tabu was signed as her replacement. In 2014 she also worked in Super Nani released on Diwali (24 October). Super Nani was a family drama, in which the grandmother (Rekha) is unappreciated by her children and husband, Randhir Kapoor. Her grandson, Sharman Joshi convinces her to change. The grandmother 'transforms' herself into a glamorous model. In 2015, she appeared in R. Balki's Shamitabh, where she played herself. In 1990, Rekha married Delhi-based industrialist Mukesh Aggarwal. A year later\u2014while she was in London\u2014he committed suicide, after several previous attempts, leaving a note, \"Don't blame anyone\". She was pilloried by the press at that time, a period which one journalist termed as \"the deepest trough in her life.\" Bhawana Somaaya observed the period speaking of \"a strong anti-wave against the actress \u2014 some called her a witch, some a murderess,\" but added that soon \"Rekha came out of the eclipse once again unblemished!\" She was rumoured to have been married to actor Vinod Mehra in 1973, but in a 2004 television interview with Simi Garewal she denied being married to Mehra referring to him as a \"well-wisher\". Rekha currently lives in her Bandra home in Mumbai. In 2011, Rediff listed her as the ninth-greatest Indian actress of all time, noting, \"It's hard not to be bowled over by Rekha's longevity, or her ability to reinvent herself... the actress took on a man's job and did it stunningly well, holding her own against all the top actors and being remembered despite them.\" Filmfare described her acting style, writing, \"...when it comes to style, sexiness or sheer onscreen presence, she's unparalleled... [she is] a fierce, raw, flinty performer with unbridled honesty. Her acting isn't gimmicky.\" Critic Khalid Mohamed commends her technical control: \"She knows how to give and to what degree. She has all that it takes to be a director. There is a kind of vulnerability in her control. She explores when she is acting.\" Shyam Benegal, who directed her in two movies, believes she is \"a director's actress\". M.L. Dhawan from The Tribune wrote, \"Rekha's flowering as an actress post Ghar and Khubsoorat climaxed in [...] Umrao Jaan. As a tragic courtesan she gave a performance of consummate artistry, adopting a much-admired huskiness and despondency of tone. Rekha communicated much with a delicately raised eyebrow. In 2010, Filmfare included two of her performances\u2014from Khubsoorat (1980) and Umrao Jaan (1981)\u2014in their list of \"80 Iconic Performances\". Her work in the latter was included on Forbes India's list of \"25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema\". Rekha has often been compared to Greta Garbo, and has been cited by media as her Indian equivalent. Hindustan Times described her physical change and loss of weight as \"one of cinema's and perhaps real life's most dramatic transformations,\" arguing that \"Rekha morphed from an overweight, dark ordinary girl into a glamorous and beautiful enigma, shrouding her life in an intriguing Garbo-like mystery.\" According to Rediff, \"Rekha's reclusive nature has gone a long way towards building an aura of mystery around her.\" Rekha rarely gives interviews, and she mostly avoids parties and events. Asked once about her mysterious image, she denied several times trying to live up to this image, asserting it is press-created: \"What mystery? The media is the one that creates this image. It's just that I am basically shy by nature, an introvert and fiercely private.\" Film journalist Anupama Chopra, who visited Rekha in 2003, wrote that while tabloids had portrayed her as \"a reclusive woman twisted bitter by lecherous men and loneliness\", in reality Rekha was \"none of these\", describing her as \"chatty and curious, excited and energetic, cheerful and almost illegally optimistic\". Writing for The Tribune, Mukesh Khosla spoke of her transformation, writing, \"From the giggling village belle in Saawan Bhadon to one of country's reigning actresses, Rekha has come a long way.\" According to critic Omar Qureshi, \"the term diva (in India) was coined for Rekha.\" Mira Nair, who directed Rekha in Kama Sutra (1997), likens her to a \"Jamini Roy painting\" and says, \"Like Marilyn Monroe is shorthand for sex, Rekha is shorthand for charisma\". Filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali labels her the \"last of the great stars\". She was referred to as the reigning Queen of Indian Cinema at the 2012 IIFA Awards held in Singapore, where she was given the \"Outstanding Contribution to Indian Cinema (Female)\" award, also referred to as the Lifetime Achievement Award."

He subsequently appeared Bardaasht and Naach, both of them being box-office duds. His first relatively successful lead role occurred in the widely panned sex-comedy Kyaa Kool Hai Hum with Tusshar Kapoor.

Madhavan began his acting career with television guest appearances, including a role on the Zee TV prime-time soap opera Banegi Apni Baat in 1996. After appearing in commercials and in small roles, he later gained recognition in the Tamil film industry through Mani Ratnam's successful romance film Alaipayuthey (2000). Madhavan soon developed an image as a romantic hero with notable roles in two of 2001's highest grossing Tamil films, Gautham Menon's directorial debut Minnale and Madras Talkies' Dumm Dumm Dumm. He worked with Mani Ratnam again in the critically acclaimed 2002 film Kannathil Muthamittal playing the father of an adopted girl, whilst he achieved commercial success with his role in N. Linguswamy's action film, Run (2002). Madhavan was cast alongside Kamal Haasan in the 2003 drama Anbe Sivam, which earned him two notable awards for Best Supporting Actor. In 2004, he gave a critically acclaimed performance as the antagonist in the multi-starrer Aayutha Ezhuthu and the film secured him his first Filmfare Award for the intense portrayal of a rogue. In the mid-2000s, Madhavan also actively pursued a career in Hindi films, by appearing in supporting roles in three highly successful productions, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's Rang De Basanti (2006), Mani Ratnam's biopic Guru (2007) and Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots (2009), which went on to become the highest grossing Indian film of all time upon release. He simultaneously worked on Tamil films, gaining critical acclaim for his portrayal of a vigilante in his home production Evano Oruvan (2007) and for the successful bilingual horror film, Yavarum Nalam (2009). After appearing in further box office hits, Tanu Weds Manu (2011) and Vettai (2012), Madhavan took a break from acting. Returning after a three-year sabbatical in 2015, his comeback films, the romantic-comedy Tanu Weds Manu Returns (2015) and the sports drama Irudhi Suttru (2016), both won critical and commercial acclaim. In addition to his acting career, Madhavan has worked as a writer on his films, hosted television programmes and has been a prominent celebrity endorser for brands and products. He has also worked as a film producer, first making Evano Oruvan with Leukos Films, before setting up Tricolour Films to produce Saala Khadoos (2016). Madhavan is noted for his philanthropic activities and promotes various causes such as environment, health and education. He is particularly vocal about the protection of animals and was awarded PETA's Person of the Year recognition in 2012.   Madhavan was born on 1 June 1970 in Jamshedpur, Bihar (now in Jharkhand), India, to a Tamil family. His father Ranganathan was a management executive in Tata Steel and his mother, Saroja was a manager in the Bank of India. His younger sister, Devika, is a software engineer settled in the United Kingdom. He had a Tamil-speaking upbringing in Bihar. In 1988, Madhavan gained a scholarship to represent India as a cultural ambassador from Rajaram College, Kolhapur and spent a year in Stettler, Alberta, Canada as part of an exchange programme. He returned to Kolhapur and completed his education, graduating with a degree in electronics. During his college years, Madhavan became actively involved in extra-curricular military training and at 22, he was recognised as amongst the leading NCC cadets in Maharashtra, which allowed him to make a trip with seven others as NCC cadets to England. As a result of this opportunity, he received training with the British Army, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, which he had, at a point, considered joining. However he missed the age cut-off by six months and was subsequently unable to join the programme. After he lost out on the place, he began teaching courses on public speaking and personality development skills in Kolhapur and the satisfaction he gained through teaching, prompted him to pursue a post-graduation in public speaking at Kishinchand Chellaram College in Mumbai. During the period, he also won the Indian Championship for Public Speaking and subsequently represented India at the Young Businessmen Conference in Tokyo, Japan in 1992. During his stint in Mumbai, he opted to create a portfolio and submit it to a modelling agency. In early 1996, Madhavan worked on a sandalwood talc advertisement directed by Santosh Sivan, who later recommended him to Mani Ratnam to take part in a screen test for a role in Iruvar (1997). Madhavan was auditioned for the leading role of Tamizhselvan amongst several other more established actors, but Mani Ratnam eventually left him out of the project citing that he thought his \"eyes looked too young\" for a senior role. As his film career failed to take off, Madhavan went on to feature in Hindi television serials, appearing as a crook in his first venture Yule Love Stories. He appeared in leading roles in Zee TV's Banegi Apni Baat and Ghar Jamai, while he gained further popularity portraying the character of Shekhar in Saaya. He also went on to act as a ship's captain in Sea Hawks, as a convict in Yeh Kahan Aa Gaye Hum and as worked as a television anchor in Tol Mol Ke Bol amongst other television appearances. His first appearance in a feature film role came through a small role in Is Raat Ki Subah Nahin (1996), where he portrayed a singer in a bar. In 1997, Madhavan appeared in a supporting role as an Indian police officer in Fred Olen Ray's English film, Inferno, which was shot in India. His first chance in Indian cinema came in the form of Shanti Shanti Shanti (1998), a Kannada film, in which he appeared as a carefree youngster alongside actor Abbas. However, the film failed to make an impact and went unnoticed at the box office. During the period, Hindi film director Vinod Pandey launched Madhavan as a Bollywood hero, with a project titled Akeli, however the film was shelved before the production process had been completed. In 1999, leading Indian director Mani Ratnam selected Madhavan to feature in the leading role of his Tamil romantic film, Alaipayuthey (2000) and the film's subsequent critical and commercial success gave Madhavan his breakthrough as an actor. Portraying the character of Karthik Varadharajan, a young husband experiencing difficulties with his marriage, Madhavan revealed that he studied the technical aspects of film-making from the director and learned the entire script of the film, irrespective of whether he was in the scene or not. He became the first d\u00e9butante actor to be cast by Mani Ratnam in the lead role of a film, and revealed that when he found out that he was set to work with the director he was overcome with a \"mixture of excitement, awe, fear and expectations\". Featuring alongside actress Shalini, Madhavan's performance was well received by critics and the film's success led to it developing \"classic\" status. A critic from The Hindu, described that Madhavan \"sails through the litmus test with ease\", whilst another review cited that Madhavan was a \"promising debutant\" into the film industry. After the success of his first Tamil film, the producers of his previous Kannada film, Shanti Shanti Shanti, dubbed the film into Tamil and released it as Relax, to capitalise on Madhavan's new-found success. Madhavan's next film, Ennavale (2000), garnered mixed reviews although Madhavan's portrayal was praised as the \"mainstay\" of the film, with claims that the film for him was a \"merely a prosaic exercise\". Madhavan's first release of 2001, Gautham Menon's directorial debut Minnale, opened to critical and commercial acclaim. Featuring a popular soundtrack by Harris Jayaraj and marketed as a Valentine's Day release, Minnale further built on the actor's image as a romantic hero and was later listed as a \"classic romantic film\" from the Tamil film industry. He then collaborated with Mani Ratnam for the second time by appearing in the director's production venture, the romantic comedy Dumm Dumm Dumm (2001), alongside Jyothika. Appearing as an unhappy groom trying to halt his wedding, the film won positive acclaim and became a commercial success, with Madhavan establishing himself as a bankable actor in South India. Madhavan then again appeared as a husband in a tumultuous marriage in Parthale Paravasam (2001), the hundredth venture of veteran director K. Balachander. Despite featuring amongst an ensemble cast and being highly anticipated prior to release, the film failed at the box-office, with critics citing that Madhavan looked \"rather bored\" with the proceedings. Similarly his first lead role in a Hindi film, Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein (2001), a remake of his Minnale, was also unsuccessful at the box office, with the film and Madhavan's performance receiving mixed reviews. However, the film belatedly gained popularity through screenings on television and subsequently developed a cult following amongst young audiences. In 2002, Madhavan played the role of a novelist in Mani Ratnam's Kannathil Muthamittal alongside actresses Keerthana, Simran and Nandita Das. In the film, he was shown as the role of the father of an adopted child, who wishes to return to her native homeland amidst the Sri Lankan civil war. The film received widespread critical acclaim and went on to win six National Awards as well as over ten awards at various International Film Festivals. Madhavan gained acclaim for his portrayal with a critic citing \"he lived the role of the character he portrays\", with the film seeing him move away from the romantic hero image for the first time into a more serious, performance-orientated role. The good performance of the film internationally also helped him develop an overseas market for his films. Madhavan's next large success came with Run, a film recognised for its screenplay, with Madhavan appearing in an action film for the first time in his career. In regard to his performance, The Hindu's critic noted \"he manages to portray action with \u00e9lan in Run and actually looks fit and comfortable in the role\", with the film helping him make a breakthrough as an action hero. Despite another unsuccessful Hindi venture with the musical, Dil Vil Pyar Vyar (2002), the success of his previous films helped him secure the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor for 2002, being jointly recognised for both films. Madhavan was cast alongside Kamal Haasan in Anbe Sivam (2003), which told the story of an unexpected journey from Bhubaneswar to Chennai of two men who are polar opposites. Madhavan revealed his elation at working with an experienced actor like Kamal Haasan, while noting that a human drama film like Anbe Sivam was important for his career as an actor as it came after a successful masala film in Run. Portraying a young frustrated filmmaker with capitalist beliefs who travels with a handicapped communist played by Kamal Haasan, Madhavan's performance was described as a \"milestone in his career\" and that \"his portrayal will remain with the viewer for long\" by a critic from The Hindu. The film opened in January 2003 to positive reviews, but became a surprise box-office failure. Post-release, the film has garnered belated critical acclaim from critics and television audiences and is considered as one of the \"cult classics\" of Tamil cinema. Film critic Baradwaj Rangan wrote that the film \"was leagues ahead of the average Tamil and Indian film\", though felt that \"the masses were unwilling to accept the experimental nature of the film\", while talking about the film's box office failure. Post-filming, Kamal Haasan revealed that he was impressed with Madhavan's enthusiasm and concentration during the making of the film and thus subsequently signed him on to appear in his production venture, Nala Damayanthi (2003), where he played a Brahmin cook lost in Australia. In 2003, the actor also appeared in Vikraman's family drama Priyamana Thozhi as a budding cricketer, Saran's romantic comedy Jay Jay and made a guest appearance in Priyadarshan's Lesa Lesa as a jailed teacher. The three films made average returns at the box office, though Madhavan's performances were appreciated by critics. Madhavan played an imposter gangster in K. S. Ravikumar's comedy Aethiree (2004) before being selected to feature in his fourth Mani Ratnam production, Aaytha Ezhuthu (2004), which featured him in an ensemble cast including Suriya, Siddharth, Meera Jasmine, Esha Deol and Trisha. Madhavan portrayed the character of Inba Sekhar, a hitman living in the slums of Chennai, whose path crosses with the characters portrayed by Suriya and Siddharth. His role also featured him in a struggling marriage, where his wife desperately tries to claw him away from his profession. Madhavan bulked up and sported a shaven look for the first time in his career to resemble the character of a ruffian and shot for the film through the sync sound technique. He received widespread praise for his depiction, with Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu claiming that Madhavan outplayed Abhishek Bachchan's interpretation of the character in the Hindi version of the bilingual, Yuva. Madhavan went on to win the Filmfare Award for the Best Tamil Supporting Actor, whilst another critic from The Hindu cited that he \"sparkles as an anti-hero\" and that the \"character ought to find a very special place in his repertoire\". Similarly, a critic from Indiaglitz.com stated \"Madhavan's daring decision to play a negative character, who gets beaten up black and blue at the end, putting his 'hero' image in peril, has paid off, as he walks away with top honours\", while a reviewer from Sify.com labelled him as \"terrific\". In late 2004, Madhavan worked on Rajiv Anchal's English-Malayalam crossover film Nothing But Life (2005) and completed his work in a single schedule across Las Vegas and Albuquerque. Portraying an orphaned youth with suicidal tendencies being treated by a Malayali psychiatrist in the USA, the film and his portrayal opened to mixed reviews. He then appeared in another marriage drama film, Priyasakhi (2005) co-starring Sadha \u2013 with the pair playing an estranged husband and wife. The film received praise for the lead pair's performances with Madhavan being praised as \"top class\", while it also became the first Tamil film to be dubbed into Zulu. From 2005 onwards, Madhavan increased his work in Hindi films and starred and wrote the Hindi dialogues for the comedy Ramji Londonwaley (2005), a remake of his earlier film Nala Damayanthi. Critics described his performance as \"a master stroke\", though the film fared averagely at the box office due to the release of other big budget films during the period. He experienced box office success in Hindi films for the first time through his role in Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's Rang De Basanti (2006). Featuring in an ensemble cast led by Aamir Khan, Madhavan essayed the guest role of flight lieutenant, whose death triggers a revolutionary movement against corruption. The film was subsequently nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 2006 BAFTA Awards, while it was also chosen as India's official entry for the Golden Globe Awards and the Academy Awards for the Best Foreign Language Film category. Madhavan then collaborated with Mani Ratnam for the fifth time with in the biopic Guru (2007), co-starring Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai and Vidya Balan. His role of Shyam Saxena was inspired from the life of real-life journalist S. Gurumurthy, who was a challenger to the business tycoon, Dhirubhai Ambani, whose life drew allusions with Bachchan's role. The film became a blockbuster and also received critical acclaim, with a reviewer citing that Madhavan acts with \"extreme, believable sincerity\" dubbing him as \"truly a poster boy for India\", whilst another claimed he performed \"a weak role with \u00e9lan\". His Tamil film, Thambi (2006) directed by Seeman, had a delayed release but became a profitable venture in town and village centres. Madhavan's portrayal of a rustic do-gooder, received positive reviews from critics though a reviewer from The Hindu claimed the actor was \"unable to shed off his classy looks\". He then appeared in Sundar C's comedy film Rendu (2006), where he played dual roles for the first time and in the long-delayed romantic comedy Aarya (2007), appearing as a medical student. Madhavan wrote the dialogues, produced and featured in the lead role in Nishikanth Kamat's Evano Oruvan (2007), playing a middle class bank employee who becomes so disgusted with the corruption he faces in his day-to-day life that he becomes a vigilante. After setting up a production studio, Leukos Films, he helped promote the film in international film festivals before the theatrical release in December 2007. Critics called the film a \"must watch\" and a reviewer from The Hindu stated that the film was \"Madhavan's best performance to date\", while he also went on to win the ITFA Best Actor Award for his depiction. However Evano Oruvan and his subsequent release, Seeman's Vaazhthukal (2008) did not perform well at the box office, while another completed film titled Naan Aval Adhu failed to have a theatrical release. Madhavan's final release of the year was the docudrama Mumbai Meri Jaan, based upon the 2006 Mumbai Bombings. The film, which featured him alongside Soha Ali Khan, Irrfan Khan and Kay Kay Menon became critically acclaimed with Madhavan's portrayal of a man with a post-traumatic stress disorder being appreciated by reviewers. Madhavan won positive acclaim for playing the lead role of an engineer experiencing eerie events in Vikram Kumar's bilingual horror film, Yavarum Nalam (2009). The film, which became a commercial and critical success, prompted a reviewer from the Times of India to suggest \"he carried the film on his shoulders\" while he was also nominated in the Best Actor category at the Vijay Awards. His following two films, the romantic comedy Guru En Aalu (2009) and the action film Sikandar (2009) in which he played a supporting role of an army officer, both fetched mixed reviews. Madhavan then portrayed one of three leading roles in Rajkumar Hirani's coming of age comedy-drama film, 3 Idiots (2009), alongside Aamir Khan and Sharman Joshi. Upon release, the film received positive reviews and went on to become the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, before being overtaken in 2013. Madhavan's portrayal as a young engineer with a passion for photography earned him nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor and for the IIFA Best Supporting Actor Award during 2010. Film critic Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama described the actor's performance as \"incredible\", while Madhavan claimed that the film changed how he was viewed as an actor in Hindi films for the better. He later turned down an offer of reprising the same role in the Tamil remake of the film helmed by Shankar. In 2010, Madhavan appeared alongside actors Amitabh Bachchan and Ben Kingsley in Teen Patti (2010) as a young professor, with Adarsh again rating his performance as \"excellent\", but the film failed at the box office. His two guest appearances in the year also received mixed feedback with his performance in the Telugu anthology film Om Shanti (2010) being praised, whilst a role in the John Abraham-starrer Jhootha Hi Sahi (2010) drew him criticism. Madhavan then collaborated again with Kamal Haasan and K. S. Ravikumar in the romantic comedy, Manmadan Ambu (2010), playing a wealthy businessman who hires a spy to follow his actress girlfriend on a European cruise tour. The film opened to positive reviews with Madhavan's performance being described by Rediff.com as \"excellent\", while Sify.com labelled him the \"scene stealer\". His only release in 2011 was the romantic drama film, Tanu Weds Manu alongside Kangana Ranaut, which saw him play the role of a sensible doctor hoping to get an arranged marriage with a girl, who has a dramatically diverse personality to him. Prior to release, the film's promotional campaign created anticipation and upon release, the film became a large success at the box office. Madhavan's portrayal of Manoj \"Manu\" Sharma won positive acclaim, with a reviewer citing that his performance was \"real, restrained, yet forceful\" and another claiming he was \"perfectly cast\". Madhavan next appeared as a police officer in Linguswamy's Tamil film Vettai (2012), an action entertainer featuring an ensemble cast of Arya, Amala Paul and Sameera Reddy. The film opened to positive reviews in January 2012 and went on to become a commercial success, with critics praising Madhavan's decision to accept the role of a timid cop, while a critic noted that he had \"an uncanny talent for comedy\". He then featured in Jodi Breakers (2012), a Hindi romantic comedy film shot in Greece alongside Bipasha Basu, though the film did not perform well commercially. In 2012, Madhavan took a sabbatical and was based in Chicago resting his knee, which he injured during the making of Vettai, causing him to suffer from chondromalacia patellae. During the period, he felt he had to \"reinvent himself\" and had to work on films which would appeal to the \"new generation of audiences\", so took a decision to work on a single film at a time. During a period of three years without any theatrical releases, his long-delayed Hindi film Taak Jhaank directed by Rituparno Ghosh in 2006, premi\u00e8red at the 19th Kolkata International Film Festival in 2013, while his first Hindi film Akeli, shot in 1997, was released online during the following year. During his recovery period and sabbatical in 2013, Madhavan signed on to appear in Simon West's Night of the Living Dead: Darkest Dawn, in which he appeared as a former marine personnel and shot for the project in California. The computer animated film, where Madhavan provided voice work, premi\u00e8red in San Diego during July 2015. Madhavan's first theatrical release after his sabbatical was Anand L. Rai's Tanu Weds Manu Returns, a sequel to the 2011 film, which released in May 2015. Prior to the film's release, Madhavan stated that the \"content of the film was more important than the stars\" and acknowledged that the popularity of Kangana Ranaut would help the film gain a good opening at the box office. Reprising his role as Manu, Madhavan won acclaim for his restrained performance and the film went on to become a critical and commercial success. The critic from Bollywood Hungama wrote \"Madhavan excels in his role despite it being a restrained one, which was anyways the call of his character\" and added \"he is very endearing who never tries to overshadow anyone and emerges a winner\", while Sify.com stated he gives a \"subtle and restrained performance\". Tanu Weds Manu Returns earned \u20b9243 crore (US$38\u00a0million) worldwide at the end of its theatrical run, to become one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films in 2015. During his sabbatical, Madhavan also worked extensively on the pre-production of the bilingual sports film, Irudhi Suttru (2016) directed by Sudha Kongara. After being impressed with Sudha's script, he helped find the project producers in Tamil and chose to produce the film in Hindi alongside Sashikanth and Rajkumar Hirani. Madhavan also met and convinced mixed martial artist Ritika Singh to act in the film after contacting her through Raj Kundra, while he was also credited for contributing as an additional screenplay writer. He also went through a body conditioning regime in Los Angeles prior to joining the film's set and learnt boxing to essay the role of a former boxer. For dubbing purposes, Madhavan wore metal braces inside his teeth, in order to create the effect of having a lisp that most boxers have from sporting injuries. Madhavan won praise for his work during the marketing campaign, having travelled throughout Tamil Nadu to promote the film, with The Hindu stating it was \"unlike other film promotions in the South\". For Irudhi Suttru, Madhavan received widespread critical acclaim for his portrayal with Sify.com stating \"he is outstanding and carries the proverbial burden of the project on his shoulder\". A critic from The Hindu stated that he was \"quietly effective\", while a reviewer from Behindwoods.com wrote that Madhavan gives his \"best performance\" and is \"excellent\" at depicting his \"characterization from being subtle to being outright effervescent\". His portrayal in the Hindi version, Saala Khadoos, received similar praise with critic Subhash K. Jha stating \"this is Madhavan\u2019s career-defining performance, he sinks so deep into his role both physically and emotionally, that the actor becomes one with the act\". Madhavan has signed on to appear in the Tamil remake of the successful Malayalam film, Charlie (2015), after being impressed by the original. Directed by Vijay and produced by Shruti Nallappa, the film will commence production in 2017. Madhavan is also working on Vikram Vedha directed by duo Pushkar\u2013Gayathri, where he portrays an encounter specialist in an ensemble cast also featuring Vijay Sethupathi. He has confirmed that he would also work on two more bilingual films directed by Sarkunam and Sangeeth Sivan, as well as on the Tamil film, Gramophone, directed by Karu Pazhaniappan and the Hindi science fiction film Chanda Mama Door Ke alongside Sushant Singh Rajput and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Madhavan was first credited as a part of the technical crew for his work in Ramji Londonwaley, an adaptation of his Tamil film Nala Damayanthi. Apart from portraying the lead role, Madhavan worked on the film as a dialogue writer and played an active role in determining the crew of the movie. In October 2007, Madhavan founded the production company, Leukos Films, and consequently bought the rights of his film, Evano Oruvan, from producers Abbas-Mustan and K. Sera Sera. Securing sponsorship deals with HSBC and Santoor, Madhavan premi\u00e8red the film across North America and the Middle East before its Indian theatrical release, with the promotion method being used for the first time in Tamil cinema. However, since the relative box office failure of the project, Madhavan downplayed future involvement in production ventures. The film, which Madhavan referred to as a \"part of his life\" during 2007, also saw him write the dialogues for the film along with Seeman by translating lines from the project's original version in the Marathi language. Madhavan then chose to become actively involved in the production of his 2016 bilingual films, Irudhi Suttru in Tamil and Saala Khadoos in Hindi, in order to ensure the film completed filming and had a theatrical release. Impressed by the strength of Sudha Kongara's script for the Tamil film, Madhavan felt that the story had pan-Indian appeal and took the film's script to Rajkumar Hirani, who agreed to produce and supervise work on the film's Hindi version. Madhavan co-produced the Hindi version of the film through his new production house, Tricolor Films, while leading the film's pan-Indian marketing campaign. The actor also helped finalise the film's lead actress, Ritika Singh, and was also credited as an additional screenplay writer in the films. Madhavan has appeared as host for television programmes on Hindi channels, while he has also been a host at film award functions. During his television career in the 1990s, Madhavan first worked as a host on Tol Mol Ke Bol. He was announced as the host of Sony Entertainment Television's Deal Ya No Deal, the Indian version of the American game show Deal Or No Deal, in October 2005. However, Madhavan quit as the lead anchor of the show in January 2006 claiming he was unhappy with the way the shoot schedules were handled by the production house. According to the actor, when he took on the show, he had made it clear that he would continue with his South Indian film assignments, and as the show was being filmed in Mumbai, he had found it hard to keep travelling throughout India from Chennai to film the ten days a month he had signed up for. Madhavan added that he was restricted by the producers to spend one day rehearsing technically, which left him with fatigue. Mandira Bedi subsequently replaced Madhavan as the anchor in February for Series 2 of the game show. In June 2010, Madhavan made a comeback to the game show format by accepting a contract with Imagine TV's Big Money show, signing on to host a single season, and then hosted an episode of the crime show Savdhaan India in January 2016. Furthermore, he has been a guest judge in the Indian television show, Fame Gurukul. In 2016, Madhavan stated that he would only take part in television commitments for money, while he does not consider his payment when signing on to appear in films. Madhavan has also hosted live events, notably the National Film Awards in 2013 with Huma Qureshi. He was also the host of the 55th Filmfare Awards South in Chennai in 2008 and then also the Vijay Awards in 2013. Madhavan is amongst the leading brand ambassadors for products in India. His early work involved advertisements for brands including Bajaj, Ponds, Fair and Lovely and TVS, before signing a major endorsing deal with Pepsi and marketing company, IMG. In 2007, Madhavan endorsed UniverCell, a multi-brand mobile phone retail chain owned by UniverCell Telecommunications India Pvt Ltd. Madhavan signed a contract with the mobile phone network, Airtel for promotions in South India before being promoted as the pan-Indian ambassador for the brand a year later. His advertisements with Vidya Balan for Airtel won critical acclaim, and brought in film offers for the pair to feature together. In June 2010, marketers from Arun Excello promoted a housing project in Oragadam, Chennai in a similar fashion to the release of a new film featuring Madhavan. With film-inspired posters and billboards put up around Chennai, the advertisement campaign attracted huge curiosity and the project became a success. His long-term work with jewellery brand, Joy Alukkas, led to the company creating life size wax models of him to place in their showrooms from January 2011. Maruti Suzuki, for whom Madhavan is the brand ambassador, launched a special edition of the Suzuki Wagon R car calling it the Madhavan Signature Edition in September 2013. In 2015, online market place Snapdeal signed on Aamir Khan and Madhavan to be the company's ambassadors, with Snapdeal attempting to use Madhavan's popularity in South India to marker their services. Madhavan, who is a vegetarian, endorses the brand, PETA. Since joining them after starring in his first film, he has appeared voluntarily in several advertisements and released an E-Card for the brand. In July 2006, Madhavan was voted the \"cutest male vegetarian\" by an online poll conducted by the NGO, People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), while Kareena Kapoor won the female award respectively. In turn he cited that his success in the competition was due to his \"healthy vegetarian diet\". In October 2010, he wrote a letter to the CEO of Kentucky Fried Chicken, on behalf of PETA, urging them to stop mistreatment of birds by the fast-food industry outlets and the killing of animals. He requested the boycott of KFC in India over animal welfare and conditions and was joined by Raveena Tandon and Rakhi Sawant in supporting the work of PETA in India. In addition, Madhavan was named PETA India\u2019s 2012 \"Person Of The Year\", while his son won PETA India's \"Compassionate Kid award\" in December 2014. Madhavan has lent his support for the Chennai-based charity, The Banyan, and appeared in the charity musical Netru, Indru, Naalai directed by Mani Ratnam for the cause. He appeared as a guest cook and newly launched restaurant in Chennai and cooked dosas for auction for the charity, helping raise forty five thousand rupees. He has been a part of an AIDS awareness programme initiated by Richard Gere in India and helped advertise the A Time for Heroes campaign appearing in a short film. Similarly Madhavan featured in a four-minute film produced by Agaram Foundation, Herova? Zerova?, campaigning for educational awareness alongside Suriya, Vijay and Jyothika. In 2010, along with his cast and crew from 3 Idiots, he helped raise Rs. 2.5\u00a0million for the renovation of the school in Leh, which was damaged by flash floods. Madhavan laid bricks and tiles at the London Business School in July 2011, building a symbolic house to represent the 100,000 houses that will be built in India by 2015 as a part of Habitat for Humanity's campaign to improve substandard houses in India. During the 2015 South Indian floods, Madhavan worked alongside other Indian actors in coordinating the relief efforts. In 2016, Lepra India signed him to work as a goodwill ambassador in helping promote action against leprosy. Madhavan is one of the few actors in India who garners pan-Indian appeal, with his success in establishing himself in the North and the South Indian film industries, seeing him receive multiple offers as a brand ambassador. Furthermore, it has led to producers offering him lead roles in bilingual films such as the English-Malayalam crossover film Nothing But Life and the Hindi-Tamil projects, Yavarum Nalam and Irudhi Suttru. Moreover, most of his Tamil films are dubbed into Telugu, where he has created a box office market without appearing in a single straight Telugu film as a lead actor. Madhavan holds a significant female fan following, which developed after his romantic roles in Alaipayuthey and Minnale. Madhavan has also been active in keeping in contact with fans, maintaining a fan email account, a Facebook fan page and a Twitter account as well as being one of the first actors of Tamil films to turn blogger with entries in the year 2000. He has appeared at functions as a special guest, and has enjoyed particularly close links with technology company, Sify, whom he signed on as his media partner for all his future releases after expressing satisfaction at the website they created for Rendu. Madhavan sat amongst a six-man jury for the selection of CNN-IBN Indian of the Year 2006. He inaugurated the Chennai International Film Festival in 2007, taking the opportunity to deliver a message on preserving the environment. A gaming company, Paradox Studios Limited, launched a new game compatible with mobile phones in July 2006, with Madhavan as the lead character. The company released two mobile game titles featuring Madhavan as their lead character. The first of the two games, Madhavan's MIG, featured the actor making a reprise of his Rang De Basanti pilot's role. In the other game titled Madhavan, the player had to help the actor get to the premi\u00e8re of his latest movie evading the paparazzi. In 2007, prominent entrepreneur N. R. Narayana Murthy requested Madhavan to be his interviewer at the India-Singapore Exposition and Madhavan went on to claim that the experience was \"unforgettable\" as Murthy was an idol to him. Madhavan has attended conferences as a motivational speaker, talking about issues including situational awareness and confidence, with a speech delivered at Damodaran Academy of Management, Coimbatore going viral online. Madhavan also took part and delivered speeches as a part of the annual India Conference at Harvard University during 2017. Madhavan's parents are Ranganathan Seshadri and Saroja. Despite Madhavan's ambition of wanting to join the army, his parents insisted he go to management school and pursue a degree in electronics. After completing the degree, he went on to teach communication and public speaking at workshops around India. At the Maharashtra workshop, he encountered his wife Sarita Birje for the first time during 1991, when she attended his class on the recommendation of her cousins. Sarita was able to use the skills she had learned from Madhavan's classes to pass an interview to become an air hostess and after completing the course, the pair began dating. They later married in 1999, before Madhavan entered mainstream films. The pair's successful marriage has been covered by the media, with Madhavan citing that advise from his mentor Mani Ratnam was useful. Sarita has worked as a costume designer in a few of Madhavan's films, most notably for Guru En Aalu (2009) when she worked along with Erum Ali, the wife of Madhavan's co-star, Abbas, for their respective husbands. Their son, Vedant was born in August 2005, which eventually led to relocating to the boat-club area in Chennai from Kilpauk, where Madhavan's parents lived with him as well as his parents-in-law. In 2009, he relocated to Kandivali, Mumbai with his wife and son, as he pursued a career in Hindi films ahead of films in the South Indian industries. Madhavan has maintained close links with fellow actors and has described actor Suriya as his best friend in the film industry. The actor also is close friends with actresses Shilpa Shetty and Bipasha Basu, as well as actors Aamir Khan and Abhishek Bachchan. He is closely associated with actor Kamal Haasan, after their appearance together in Anbe Sivam, and has revealed that he considers the actor as his inspiration. He has also collaborated multiple times with directors Mani Ratnam, Rajkumar Hirani and Aanand Rai, citing that the film makers \"understand him well\" and share a good \"comfort level\". He has also helped out actresses Reemma Sen, Sadha and Nisha Kothari by signing them on for roles in his films, when they were going through a barren spell. Madhavan announced a sabbatical from films in late 2010 citing he would take the time off to visit London, lose weight, play golf, take treatment for his knee injury and spend time with family. Though he kept away from starting new projects, during the period he was involved in the promotional activity of two of his releases, Manmadan Ambu and Tanu Weds Manu. He later made a comeback, earlier than anticipated, after director Linguswamy convinced him to work on Vettai. The actor later took an extended sabbatical from 2012 onwards to work on his fitness and get into shape for his role as a retired boxer in Irudhi Suttru. Madhavan is a keen golf player, having played for pleasure alongside actor Amitabh Bachchan and director Mani Ratnam, while also appearing in a celebrity charity event in 2007. He also made an appearance for Chennai Rhinos in the 2011 Celebrity Cricket League, playing against Karnataka Bulldozers. His experiences flying Cessna planes when he was with National Cadet Corps, also led to a passion for aero-modelling, with the actor stating it \"justified his decision\" to pursue a degree in electronics.

        "artist_name": "Sadhana_Shivdasani", 
        "biography": " Sadhana Shivdasani (2 September 1941 \u2013 25 December 2015), better known mononymously as Sadhana, was an Indian actress who was one of the top actresses in the 1960s and the late1970s, a period regarded as Bollywood's \"golden era\". Shivdasani appeared in a Sindhi language film Abaana and entered Hindi film industry through 1960's romantic film Love in Simla. Her fringe haircut became popular during the 1960s and came to be known as \"Sadhana cut\". She became famous with her three suspense thriller films: Woh Kaun Thi? (1964), Mera Saaya (1966) and Anita (1967), all directed by Raj Khosla. She was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for films Woh Kaun Thi? and Waqt in 1965 and 1966 respectively. She took retirement from the film industry in mid 1970s before which she also directed and co-produced few films.[citation needed]   Born in a Sindhi family in Karachi, British India on 2 September 1941, Sadhana was named after her father's favorite actress-dancer Sadhana Bose. Her father was elder brother of actor Hari Shivdasani, father of actress Babita. The family migrated from Karachi during the post-Partition riots and settled in Mumbai. Her mother home-schooled her until she was 8 years old after which she studied at Auxilium Convent, Wadala and Jai Hind College. Sadhana aspired to be an actress since childhood. Her father helped her enter films. In 1955 she played a chorus girl in the song \"Mur Mur Ke Na Dekh Mur Mur Ke\" in Raj Kapoor's Shree 420. When she was 15 years old, she was approached by some producers who had seen her act in a college play. They cast her in India's first Sindhi film titled Abaana (1958), where she played the role of Sheila Ramani's younger sister. A photograph of her publicizing the film appeared in a movie magazine Screen. It was then that Sashadhar Mukherjee, one of Hindi cinema's leading producers at that time, noticed her. She joined Mukherjee's acting school along with her debutant co-star Joy Mukherjee, Sashadhar\u2019s son. R. K. Nayyar, who had previously worked as assistant director on few films, directed this film. He also created her trademark look, called Sadhana cut, inspired from British actress Audrey Hepburn. The Filmalaya Production banner thus introduced Joy, Sadhana and her iconic hairstyle in their 1960 romantic film Love in Simla. The film was declared a hit at the box office and was listed in the top 10 films of 1960. During this period she would again work under the same banner opposite Joy in Ek Musafir Ek Haseena. Alongside Love in Simla, Sadhana was signed by acclaimed director Bimal Roy for his satirical film on Indian democracy, Parakh. She portrayed a simple village girl in this multi-award-winning film. In 1961's other hit Hum Dono, she played the love interest of Dev Anand. This black-and-white film was colourized and re-released in 2011. Rediff.com in the film's review writes about Sadhana; \"Her eyes, expressive and captivating, do most of the work, while she balances out her submissiveness with a firm tongue.\" The duet \"Abhi Na Jaao Chhodkar\" from the film Hum Dono is regarded as \"the most romantic song\" by actor Shah Rukh Khan and director Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Author Amit Chaudhuri in an essay comparing cultures says that Sadhana's curious expressions in the song denote listener's peculiar ecstasy while in other cinemas it would mean sex or love. In 1962, she was again paired with Dev Anand in Asli-Naqli by director Hrishikesh Mukherjee. The same year saw director-screenwriter Raj Khosla cast her opposite Joy in Ek Musafir Ek Hasina. Khosla would again work with Sadhana to make a suspense thriller trilogy. In 1963, Sadhana played her first role in a technicolour film Mere Mehboob directed by H. S. Rawail. The film was the \"blockbuster\" of 1963 and ranked in the top 5 films of the 1960s. In 1964, she played a double role in the first of the suspense-thriller trilogy, Woh Kaun Thi? This white-sari-clad performance opposite Manoj Kumar earned her first Filmfare nomination as Best Actress. Through this role she got to be part of Lata Mangeshkar \u2013 Madan Mohan\u2019s songs \"Naina Barse\" and \"Lag Ja Gale\". Rediff.com called her a show-stopper \"with an intriguing Mona Lisa-like smile\". The film was a box office \"Hit\". Raj Khosla cast her in two more successful mystery films, Mera Saaya (1966) and Anita (1967) thus making her famous as the \"Mystery girl\". Mera Saaya, a box office \"Super Hit\" courtroom drama film again saw her playing a double role, now opposite Sunil Dutt. The song \"Jhumka Gira Re\" sung by Asha Bhosle and composed by Madan Mohan saw Sadhana perform dance steps choreographed by Saroj Khan. Khan was then an assistant to dance director B. Sohanlal. The song became so popular that excited audience in cinema halls used to throw coins at the screen, and is one of the most requested songs on radio. Sadhana got her second Filmfare nomination as Best Actress for the role of Meena in Yash Chopra's directorial saga Waqt (1965). She stood out in Bollywood\u2019s first ever ensemble cast by bringing along the fashion of tight churidar-kurtas. The film proved to be 1965's \"blockbuster hit\". Her other notable works in the 1960s include performances in Rajkumar (1964), Dulha Dulhan (1964), Gaban (1966) and Budtameez (1966).[citation needed] Sadhana had health issues due to her thyroid, which she got treated in Boston. After returning from the USA, she starred in the successful movies Intaquam (1969), Ek Phool Do Mali (1969), Aap Aye Bahaar Ayee (1971), Dil Daulat Duniya (1972), Geeta Mera Naam (1974). In Intaquam she played the role of a woman who revengefully allures the son of her own boss who cheated her to be put behind the bars for a crime she did not commit. In 1974 her directorial venture Geeta Mera Naam released. Produced by her husband, the film had herself playing the lead actress along with Sunil Dutt and Feroz Khan. It was also Saroj Khan's first film as an independent dance director. A non-lexical vocable from the song \"Mujhe Maar Daalo\" of this film appears in the song \"People\" which features in American rapper J Dilla's album Donuts (2006). After that, she retired from acting as she did not want to be cast as a side-actress or do character roles. Later, she and her husband formed a production company. She also produced a movie, Pati Parmeshwar, starring Dimple Kapadia in 1989. Sadhana married her Love in Simla director Ram Krishna Nayyar on 7 March 1966. Their love blossomed on the film set. But as she was very young then, her parents opposed it. They were married for nearly thirty years, until his death in 1995 from asthma. The couple had no children. She suffered from eye problems due to hyperthyroidism. After her retirement from acting, she refused to be photographed. Living in Santacruz, Mumbai, she rented an apartment building owned by singer Asha Bhosle. Sadhana introduced the fringe hairstlye in Indian film industry in her first film Love in Simla. R.K. Nayyar, director of the film and her future husband, suggested the fringe style in order to make her forehead look narrower. Sadhana says, \"They tried to stick a strip near the hair-line, but it didn\u2019t work out.\" Nayyar then suggested she go for the fringe style as was then sported by the Hollywood actress Audrey Hepburn. The fringe soon became popular and a fashion fad in the 1960s. The style was copied by girls in India and is still known by the same name. The look suited the role of naughty, pretty, glamourous Sonia that she played. But when Sadhana went on the shoot for Bimal Roy's Parakh, Roy was disappointed to see her modern look. She had to stick her fringe back in order to match the simple village girl she played here. In 1963, when she signed to play a role of simple Muslim girl from Aligarh in Mere Mehboob, Sadhana undid her famous \"Sadhana cut\" to fit the bill. She had centre-parted her hair and wore it in a plait; which was immediately discarded by the director H.S. Rawail. He said that the audience wanted to see her signature \"Sadhana cut\" and demanded it. Recently, the Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone sported the same fringe in her films Om Shanti Om (2007) and Chandni Chowk To China (2009). Sadhana is also credited for bringing into fashion tight chudidar-kurta. She went with this concept of gracefully changing the traditional loose salwar kameez to her director Yash Chopra for 1965's film Waqt. Chopra felt insecure and thought that it would not be accepted. But Sadhana with the help of her fashion designer Bhanu Athaiya showed him a sample, which he liked. The trend lasted well in the 1970s and can be seen to be adopted by many actresses. In a song sequence of \"Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte\" for Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), actress Bipasha Basu dressed herself in a white chudidar-kurta and also frolicked with the famous fringe as a tribute to Sadhana. In 2014, Sadhana made a rare public appearance walking the ramp in a pink sari at a fashion show to support the cause for cancer and AIDS patients. She was escorted by her relative actor Ranbir Kapoor. Despite the fact that many of Shivdasani's films fared very well at the box office, she did not receive any of the leading awards of the film industry. She was nominated for the Filmfare Award in Best Actress category for her roles in Woh Kaun Thi? and Waqt.[citation needed] For her contribution to film, she was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the IIFA in 2002. During her later years, Sadhana was involved in court cases and suffering from illness. She had undergone an emergency surgery due to a bleeding oral lesion in December 2014 at the K J Somaiya Medical College. Sadhana died on 25 December 2015 in Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai after being hospitalised with high fever. Although the illness she briefly suffered from was officially undisclosed, a family friend confirmed Sadhana had cancer."

        "artist_name": "Saif_Ali_Khan", 
        "biography": " Saif Ali Khan (pronounced\u00a0[\u02c8s\u025b\u02d0f \u0259\u02c8li \u02c8xa\u02d0n]; born Sajid Ali Khan on 16 August 1970) is an Indian film actor and producer. The son of actress Sharmila Tagore and the late cricketer Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, Khan made his acting debut in Yash Chopra's unsuccessful drama Parampara (1993), but achieved success with his roles in the romantic drama Yeh Dillagi and the action film Main Khiladi Tu Anari (both 1994). Khan's career prospect declined through much of the 1990s, and his biggest commercial success of the decade came with the ensemble drama Hum Saath-Saath Hain (1999). He rose to prominence with roles in two ensemble comedy-dramas\u2014Dil Chahta Hai (2001) and Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003). The 2004 romantic comedy Hum Tum proved to be Khan's first success in which he played the sole male lead, earning him the National Film Award for Best Actor, and starring roles in the drama Parineeta and the romantic comedy Salaam Namaste (both 2005) established him as a leading actor in Bollywood. He went on to earn wide critical praise for his portrayal of an apprentice in the 2006 English film Being Cyrus, a character based on William Shakespeare's antagonist Iago in the 2006 crime film Omkara and a terrorist in the 2009 thriller Kurbaan. Khan's greatest commercial success came with the 2008 thriller Race and its 2013 sequel, the 2009 romance Love Aaj Kal, and the 2012 romantic comedy Cocktail. Khan is the recipient of several accolades, including a National Film Award and six Filmfare Awards, and received the Padma Shri, the fourth highest Indian civilian award, in 2010. He has been noted for his performances in a range of film genres\u2014from crime dramas to thrillers and occasional romances\u2014and his film roles have been credited with contributing to a change in the concept of a Hindi film hero. Khan was married to his first wife, Amrita Singh, for thirteen years, after which he married the actress Kareena Kapoor. He has three children\u2014two with Singh and one with Kapoor. In addition to film acting, Khan is a frequent television presenter, stage show performer and the owner of the production company Illuminati Films.   Khan was born on 16 August 1970 in New Delhi, India to Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, a former captain of the Indian national cricket team, and his wife Sharmila Tagore, a film actress. From 1952\u201371, Pataudi held the title of Nawab of Pataudi, but following his death a pagri ceremony was held in the village of Pataudi, Haryana to crown Khan as the tenth Nawab of Pataudi.[a] Khan has two younger sisters, Saba and actress Soha Ali Khan, and is the paternal grandson of Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi who played for the Indian cricket team in England in 1946. Khan is of Bengali descent on his mother's side, and on his father's side he is of Pathan descent. Speaking about his childhood, Khan said that he was exposed to a \"life beyond movies\", and his mother described him as someone who was \"not an easy child [...] He was impulsive [and] spontaneous.\" As a child, he recalls fond memories of watching his father playing cricket in the garden, and has emphasised his father's education and background as having a lasting impression on how family life was conducted. Khan studied at The Lawrence School, Sanawar in Himachal Pradesh and was later sent to Lockers Park School in Hertfordshire at the age of nine. He next enrolled at Winchester College and explained that \"I did not take advantage of my tenure [there]. My classmates went on to Oxford and Cambridge, but I was not academically inclined. When I applied myself, which was not often, I stood first. I should have studied harder.\" Upon graduating from the boarding school, Khan returned to India and worked for an advertising firm in Delhi for two months. He later appeared in the television commercial for Gwalior Suiting on the insistence of a family friend, and was subsequently cast by director Anand Mahindroo. The project eventually got cancelled but Khan relocated to Mumbai to pursue a career in film; he recalls, \"Finally I had some direction and focus. I remember [...] feeling so excited that I could go to Mumbai, stay in my own place and enjoy the adventure of starting my own career.\" In 1991, Khan was cast as the male lead in Rahul Rawail's romantic drama Bekhudi (1992) alongside debutante Kajol, but after completing the first shooting schedule of the film, he was considered to be unprofessional by Rawail and was replaced by Kamal Sadanah. While filming Bekhudi, Khan met actress Amrita Singh who he married in October 1991. Singh gave birth to their daughter (Sara) and son (Ibrahim) in 1993 and 2001 respectively, and the couple later separated in 2004. In 1993, Khan made his acting debut with Parampara, a drama directed by Yash Chopra. The film, which tells the story of two estranged brothers (played by Aamir Khan and Khan), failed to find a wide audience. He next appeared opposite Mamta Kulkarni and Shilpa Shirodkar in the box office flops Aashiq Awara and Pehchaan (both 1993) respectively, but Khan earned the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut for his performance in Aashiq Awara at the 39th Filmfare Awards. Following an appearance in the moderately successful drama Imtihaan (1994), Khan starred in and earned public recognition with his next two releases opposite Akshay Kumar: Yash Raj Films' hit romantic drama Yeh Dillagi and the action film Main Khiladi Tu Anari. Yeh Dillagi was an unofficial remake of the 1954 Hollywood film Sabrina, and narrated the story of a chauffeur's daughter (played by Kajol) who becomes a model and engages in a love triangle between two brothers (played by Kumar and Khan). Main Khiladi Tu Anari (the second film in the Khiladi series) featured Khan as an aspiring actor and emerged as the fifth highest-grossing film of the year. Bollywood Hungama reported that the success of both films proved a breakthrough for Khan, and his performance in Main Khiladi Tu Anari fetched him his first Best Supporting Actor nomination at the annual Filmfare Awards. Khan found no success in his next two releases of the year: the dramas Yaar Gaddar and Aao Pyaar Karen, and his career prospect declined through much of the 1990s. All nine films in which he starred\u2014Surakshaa (1995), Ek Tha Raja (1996), Bambai Ka Babu (1996), Tu Chor Main Sipahi (1996), Dil Tera Diwana (1996), Hamesha (1997), Udaan (1997), Keemat: They Are Back (1998) and Humse Badhkar Kaun (1998)\u2014were critically and commercially unsuccessful. Critics generally perceived at this time that his career was over. After four consecutive years of poorly received films, Khan's career prospects began to improve in 1999; he appeared in four films: Yeh Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan, Kachche Dhaage, Aarzoo and Hum Saath-Saath Hain. The romantic comedy Yeh Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan (alongside Twinkle Khanna) and the romance Aarzoo (alongside Madhuri Dixit and Akshay Kumar) earned little at the box office, but the action-thriller Kachche Dhaage (a story about two estranged brothers becoming the target of a terrorist conspiracy) was Khan's first commercial success since Main Khiladi Tu Anari. Directed by Milan Luthria, the film was generally well received but critics noted that Khan was overshadowed by co-actor Ajay Devgan. The feature, however, earned Khan a Best Supporting Actor nomination at Filmfare. Khan described his final release of the year, the Sooraj Barjatya-directed family drama Hum Saath-Saath Hain, as a \"morale-booster\". The film featured an ensemble cast (Mohnish Behl, Salman Khan, Tabu, Karisma Kapoor and Sonali Bendre) and emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year, earning over \u20b9800 million (US$12\u00a0million) worldwide. During the filming of Hum Saath-Saath Hain, Khan was charged with poaching two blackbucks in Kankani along with co-stars Salman, Tabu, Bendre and Neelam Kothari. That year, he also appeared briefly in the David Dhawan-directed comedy Biwi No.1, a box office hit. The drama Kya Kehna from director Kundan Shah was Khan's only release of 2000, in which he played the casanova Rahul Modi. Co-starring alongside Preity Zinta and Chandrachur Singh, Khan compared the portrayal of his character with his own evolving maturity as a father. The film addressed themes of single parenthood and teenage pregnancy and emerged a sleeper hit. The Indian Express believed that Khan \"looks debauched enough to be the rogue he plays. He is the only dark aspect in a film that is sunny and bright even at its most tragic.\" In 2001, Khan appeared in Eeshwar Nivas' box office flop Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega, (a film loosely inspired by the 1996 black comedy Fargo) following which he featured alongside Aamir Khan and Akshaye Khanna in Farhan Akhtar's coming-of-age dramedy Dil Chahta Hai. Depicting the contemporary routine life of Indian affluent youth, it is set in modern-day urban Mumbai and focuses on a major period of transition in the lives of three young friends. Khan played Sameer Mulchandani, a \"hopeless romantic\", and was particularly drawn to the qualities of his character. Dil Chahta Hai was popular with critics and earned the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi; it performed well in the big cities but failed in the rural areas, which was attributed by critics to the urban-oriented lifestyle it presented. The feature marked a significant turning point in Khan's career, earning him the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Comic Role and awards for Best Supporting Actor at the Screen, Zee Cine and International Indian Academy (IIFA) ceremonies. Rediff.com wrote that Khan was able to rise above his \"under sketched character\", and the critic Taran Adarsh described him as \"excellent\" arguing that it was his \"career-best performance\". Following an appearance in two poorly received films: Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein (2001) and Na Tum Jaano Na Hum (2002), Khan played a photographer in the second chapter (\"No Smoking\") of Prawaal Raman's anthology ensemble thriller Darna Mana Hai (2003). The film failed to find a wide audience and earned little at the box office. Bollywood Hungama described his next film, the Nikhil Advani-directed romantic drama Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), as a \"landmark\" in his career. Set in New York City, it was written by Karan Johar and co-starred Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta. With a worldwide revenue of over \u20b9860 million (US$13\u00a0million), the film was received favourably by critics, and became India's second-biggest hit of the year. It also did well internationally and became the highest-grossing film of the year overseas. Khan was cast in the role of Rohit Patel\u2014a carefree young man who falls in love with Zinta's character\u2014after Advani had seen his performance in Dil Chahta Hai. Writing for Outlook, Komal Nahta described Khan as a \"natural\" and \"extremely endearing\", and Ram Kamal Mukherjee from Stardust opined that he was successful in displaying \"a gamut of emotions.\" Khan garnered several awards for his performance, including the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor, and expressed gratitude to Shah Rukh for teaching \"me so much\u2014mainly the responsibility of the main lead\". He explained that the film's success led to Yash Raj Films casting him in the 2004 romantic comedy Hum Tum. At the end of the year, he appeared briefly as Cpt. Anuj Nayyar in J. P. Dutta's box office flop LOC Kargil. In an attempt to avoid typecasting and broaden his range as an actor, Khan starred as Karan Singh Rathod in the thriller Ek Hasina Thi (2004), a character he described as \"a Charles Sobhraj-meets-James Bond kind of a guy\". The film (which marked the debut of Sriram Raghavan) tells the story of a young woman (played by Urmila Matondkar) who meets with Khan's character, and is subsequently arrested for having links with the underworld. When Khan was initially offered the project, he was unable to do it due to his busy schedule. However, he agreed when Raghavan approached him for the second time, and in preparation for the role, exercised extensively for six months to achieve the physical requirements of his character. Upon release, the film was positively received by critics, with Khan's performing earning praise. Film critic Anupama Chopra wrote that Khan gave \"an accomplished performance\", whilst The Deccan Herald opined that he was successful in \"break[ing] out of the cool dude stereotype\" and \"hold[ing] his own in a movie that is completely Urmila's.\" For his performance, Khan received nominations at the Screen, Zee Cine and IIFA ceremonies. For his next release, Khan featured in a starring role opposite Rani Mukerji in Kunal Kohli's Hum Tum, a romantic comedy about two headstrong individuals who meet at different stages of their lives. He was cast in the role of Karan Kapoor (a young cartoonist and womaniser) after Aamir Khan was unable to do the film; Kohli said, \"I realised that the role needed a younger man [...] someone who could present a more youthful picture. Saif has this unique quality, he can play a 21-year old as well as a 29-year old and was ideal for [the film].\" With a worldwide revenue of \u20b9426 million (US$6.6\u00a0million), the film proved one of the biggest commercial successes of the year and Khan's first success in which he played the sole male lead. Rediff.com wrote about his performance: \"Saif reprises his urbane self from Dil Chahta Hai and Kal Ho Naa Ho, peppering it with occasional fits of introspection and angst, and marking himself as an actor whose time has come.\" He won the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Comic Role and was conferred the National Film Award for Best Actor at the 52nd National Film Awards among much controversy. It marked the beginning of his work with Yash Raj Films, one of the largest production houses in Bollywood. In 2004, Khan began dating model Rosa Catalano who he separated with three years later. In 2005, Rediff.com published that Khan had established himself as a leading actor of Hindi cinema with starring roles in the drama Parineeta and the comedy-drama Salaam Namaste. An adaptation of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's 1914 Bengali novella by the same name, Parineeta was directed by Pradeep Sarkar, and narrated the love story of an idealist (Lalita, played by Vidya Balan) and a musician (Shekhar, played by Khan), the son of a capitalist businessman. Although the film's producer, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, considered Khan to be too inexperienced for the part, he was persuaded by Sarkar who felt that Khan was perfect for the role. The film garnered critical acclaim upon release and Khan's portrayal earned him his first Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. Derek Elley from Variety wrote, \"Khan, who has gradually been developing away from light comedy, again shows smarts as a substantial actor.\" Siddharth Anand's Salaam Namaste became the first Indian feature to be filmed entirely in Australia and went on to become the year's highest-grossing Bollywood production outside of India with worldwide ticket sales of \u20b9572 million (US$8.9\u00a0million). The film tells the story of a contemporary cohabiting Indian couple and their subsequent struggle with an unexpected pregnancy. Khan played the role of Nikhil Arora, a single modern young man who leaves India to make his own life in Melbourne. The critic Taran Adarsh praised Khan for delivering his third successive performance and Khalid Mohamed noted that he \"rescues several untidily written scenes with his neat wit and that flustered [...] facial expression.\" He next played the protagonist in the English language art film, Being Cyrus (2006), co-starring alongside Naseeruddin Shah and Dimple Kapadia. Directed by debutant Homi Adajania, the psychological drama revolves around a dysfunctional Parsi family with who Khan's character moves into. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Khan was particularly praised. Later in the year, he portrayed the character of Iago in Omkara, the Indian adaptation of William Shakespeare's Othello. Directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, the film is a tragedy of sexual jealousy set against the backdrop of the political system in Uttar Pradesh. The film premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and was also selected for screening at the Cairo International Film Festival. Omkara was received positively by critics, and Khan went on to receive major acclaim earning the awards for Best Performance in a Negative Role at the Filmfare, Screen, Zee Cine and IIFA ceremonies; his performance was later included in the 2010 issue of the \"Top 80 Iconic Performances\" by Filmfare. Variety described it as a \"powerhouse performance\" and wrote that \"[i]t is Khan's movie through and through, in a performance of rugged, contained malevolence which trades on his previous screen persona as a likable best friend as well as his stint as the manipulative outsider in Being Cyrus. It is smart casting, superbly realized.\" By 2007, Khan was keen on branching out into film production to \"explore various genres of commercial and intellectually stimulating cinema\". The critical success of Being Cyrus led him to create Illuminati Films and partner up with producer Dinesh Vijan, someone who he shared a \"like-minded perspective and ideology [...] with regard to cinema\". Khan next reunited with producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra in the epic drama Eklavya: The Royal Guard (2007), alongside Amitabh Bachchan, Boman Irani, Sharmila Tagore and Vidya Balan. Set in the state of Rajasthan during the early years of Indian independence, the movie revolves around a jealous and ungrateful ruler and his ailing wife. Although the film did not succeed at the box office, it was chosen as India's official entry to the Oscars. BBC Online described the film as a \"cinematic experience\" and praised Khan's growth as an actor, particular noting his scene with Bachchan's character. Following an appearance in the poorly received action-comedy Nehlle Pe Dehlla, (a production that had been delayed since 2001) Khan featured opposite Rani Mukerji in the family drama, Ta Ra Rum Pum (2007). Directed by Siddharth Anand, it received mixed reactions from the critics but earned over \u20b9690 million (US$11\u00a0million) in India and abroad. Writing for Hindustan Times, Khalid Mohamed praised Khan for displaying a new maturity but Rajeev Masand thought that neither he nor Mukerji \"are able to make much of an impression because their characters are so unidimensional and boring.\" Khan received further success in 2008, starring in the Abbas-Mustan thriller Race with an ensemble cast including Anil Kapoor, Akshaye Khanna, Bipasha Basu, Katrina Kaif and Sameera Reddy. The feature was loosely adapted from the 1998 American film Goodbye Lover, and became one of the biggest box office hits, earning \u20b91.03 billion (US$16\u00a0million) worldwide. CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand found Khan to be a standout among the ensemble, adding that he has \"the least dialogue but the one who makes the best impression\". This was followed by three projects produced by Yash Raj Films: the action-thriller Tashan, the fantasy-drama Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic, and the animated film Roadside Romeo, all of which were not successful. In 2009, Khan appeared in the romantic drama Sanam Teri Kasam, a production that had been delayed since 2000. The film garnered negative reviews and poor box office returns. Khan's role was small, and not well received. He next released his company's first project: Love Aaj Kal (2009), a romantic drama from the writer-director Imtiaz Ali. Featured opposited Deepika Padukone, the film documented the changing value of relationships among the youth, and Khan played dual roles\u2014the younger part of Rishi Kapoor's character (Veer Singh) and Jai Vardhan Singh, an ambitious architect. Love Aaj Kal received mostly positive reviews by critics and became one of the highest-grossing films of the year, earning over \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide. Gaurav Malani of The Economic Times described his performance as \"refreshing natural\" and \"outstanding\". At the 55th Filmfare Awards, the feature was nominated for Best Film and Khan received an additional nomination for Best Actor. He then starred in the dramatic thriller Kurbaan, alongside Kareena Kapoor and Vivek Oberoi. Produced by Dharma Productions, the film marked the directorial debut of Rensil D'Silva and featured Khan in the role of a terrorist. Upon release, Kurbaan was received favourably by critics and Khan's performance was critically acclaimed. A review in The Telegraph praised his \"easy transition from a charming lover to a heartless man on a deadly mission.\" Khan did not make any screen appearances in 2010. In 2011, he appeared in Prakash Jha's multi-starrer drama Aarakshan. Set in the city of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, the film deals with the policy of caste-based reservations in government jobs and educational institutions. Khan portrayed the character of Deepak Kumar, a rebellious student who joins the mafia. To prepare for the role, Khan was required to take acting workshops along with the rest of the cast. Prior to its release, the film was banned from releasing in select cities across India due to its controversial subject. While the film received a mixed critical reaction, his performance was generally well received. The following year, Khan produced both of his films. For his first release, he collaborated once again with director Sriram Raghavan, as the protagonist in the action thriller Agent Vinod. Khan described it as his \"most ambitious project\", but the film opened to mixed reviews and eventually under-performed at the box office grossing \u20b9400 million (US$6.2\u00a0million) in India on a budget of \u20b9620 million (US$9.6\u00a0million). In his following release, Homi Adajania's romantic comedy Cocktail, he featured as the software engineer Gautam Kapoor. Set in London, the film follows the story of Khan's character and his relationship with two temperamentally different women\u2014an impulsive party girl (Veronica, played by Deepika Padukone) and a submissive girl next door (Meera, played by Diana Penty). Khan described the project as \"a love story with a modern sensibility and treatment\", and agreed to produce and feature in the film after his role was declined by Imran Khan. Critics were divided in their opinion of the film, but it emerged a financial success grossing over \u20b91.2 billion (US$19\u00a0million) worldwide. Gaurav Malani of The Times of India described Khan's performance as \"effortless\" and noted that he was in his \"comfort zone\". On 16 October 2012, Khan married actress Kareena Kapoor (after a five-year courtship) in a private ceremony in Bandra, Mumbai, and a reception was later held at The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and the Lutyens Bungalow Zone in Mumbai and Delhi respectively. The following year, Khan collaborated with Deepika Padukone for the fourth time (alongside Anil Kapoor, John Abraham, Jacqueline Fernandez and Ameesha Patel) in Abbas-Mustan's Race 2 (2013), an ensemble action thriller that served as a sequel to the 2008 film Race. The film received predominantly negative reviews from critics, but with a total collection of \u20b91.62 billion (US$25\u00a0million), it proved to be a commercial success and his highest-grossing film to date. He was next cast as the \"Russian mafia don\", Boris in Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K.'s Go Goa Gone (a film described as \"India's first zom-com\") alongside Kunal Khemu and Vir Das. Khan, who bleached his hair for the film, was particularly drawn to the project for its novel concept and its \"action, comedy and violence\". The critic Rajeev Masand described the film as \"a winning cocktail of laugh-out-loud dialogue and well-timed performances by the three leads\", and in particular noted Khan's scene with Khemu's character. His final release of the year was Bullett Raja, a crime drama directed by Tigmanshu Dhulia, and co-starring Jimmy Shergill and Sonakshi Sinha. Khan explained that he found himself challenged playing the role of Raja Mishra (a common man who turns into a gangster) but \"totally relied\" on the director's guidance. Bullett Raja earned little at the box office and received predominantly negative reviews. Writing for Firstpost, Mihir Fadnavis found Khan to be \"miscast\" and described his performance as \"farcial\". In an interview with The Times of India, Khan explained that he regretted starring in the 2014 Sajid Khan-directed comedy Humshakals. Co-starring alongside an ensemble cast (Ritesh Deshmukh, Ram Kapoor, Bipasha Basu, Tamannaah and Esha Gupta), Khan portrayed three different characters in an attempt to \"expand my market\" and step out of his comfort zone. The Hindustan Times described it as a \"dim-witted comedy\" and criticised Khan for being \"the worst thing about [the film].\" He next produced and featured in Happy Ending (2014), a romantic comedy directed by Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K. NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee found Khan's character of a struggling writer to be \"a breezy rejig of his Hum Tum and Salaam Namaste persona of a decade ago\", and noted that \"the many collegiate hook-ups and break-ups he pulls off in Happy Ending do not look completely at odds with the film's purpose.\" Both Humshakals and Happy Ending underperformed at the box office. Following a brief appearance in the comedy Dolly Ki Doli (2015), he appeared alongside Katrina Kaif in Kabir Khan's counter-terrorism drama Phantom (2015). Based on the book Mumbai Avengers by Hussain Zaidi, the film is a retelling on the aftermath of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. Khan was cast as Cpt. Daniyal Khan, a former soldier hired by the RAW agency. Phantom generated controversy when the Central Board of Film Censors deemed that the film represented Pakistan in a negative light and banned the film from releasing there. A review in The Hollywood Reporter noted that Khan was \"well cast\" and \"believable\" in his role, and Rachit Gupta of Filmfare described his performance as \"a heady mix of bravado and restrained intensity [which] works in parts only.\" Although Khan was pleased with the film's performance, Phantom was generally perceived to be a box-office failure grossing \u20b9844 million (US$13\u00a0million) worldwide on a budget of \u20b9720 million (US$11\u00a0million). After a year-long absence from the screen, Khan starred as filmmaker Rustom \"Rusi\" Billimoria in his second collaboration with Vishal Bhardwaj, an epic romance set during World War II entitled Rangoon (2017). Co-starring alongside Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut, Khan described his character as \"bad-tempered and highly talented,\" and drew inspirations from the mannerisms of his grandfather and the character Darth Vader. The film received mixed reviews and failed to find a wide audience at the box office. Rajeev Masand termed the film \"overlong, indulgent to the point of exhaustion\", but praised Khan for \"imbu[ing] Russi with the swagger and the arrogance of an aristocrat from the forties\". Writing for The Hindu, critic Namrata Joshi found Khan to be \"a revelation despite his intermittent presence\". As of March 2017, Khan is currently co-producing and working on an untitled project by Akshat Verma. He has also begun shooting for the Indian remake of the 2014 comedy-drama Chef. Alongside his acting career, Khan has participated in several concert tours and televised award ceremonies. He performed in his first concert tour, \"Temptations 2004\", with actors Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta, Arjun Rampal and Priyanka Chopra. Showcased in over 22\u00a0countries across the world, it became Bollywood's most prominent international concert to that point. In December 2005, Khan performed alongside the band Parikrama at the Mittal Gardens in New Delhi, and later reunited with them and Strings for \"The Royal Stag Mega Music Concert\" (a four-city concert tour) two years later. The following year, he was part of the \"Heat 2006\" world tour, along with Akshay Kumar, Preity Zinta, Sushmita Sen and Celina Jaitley. He later performed along with several other Bollywood personalities at the closing ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Since October 2011, Khan has taken the responsibility of managing his father's eye hospital and has also made public appearances to support various other charitable causes. In February 2005, Khan and several other Bollywood actors participated in the 2005 HELP! Telethon Concert to raise money for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. He took part in a charity cricket match organized by IIFA at the Headingley Stadium in West Yorkshire, England in 2007, and later hosted an event organized by the award ceremony to help raise funds for various charities in 2011. In November 2008, Khan performed in a concert to raise money for the victims of the 2008 Bihar flood and in September 2013, he attended a charity dinner organized by The Venu Eye institute, donating two of his personal belongings to help raise funds for cataract operations. Later that year, he spent time with underprivileged kids during the filming of Bullett Raja. In October 2014, Khan was appointed as an ambassador for Olympic Gold Quest and donated \u20b92 million (US$31,000) to help raise funds for the training of athletes. In an interview with Rajeev Masand, Khan described himself as \"a very private person\". The journalist Roshmila Bhattacharya added, \"Unlike most actors, his interests are not limited to box office collections and workout routines. [He] can converse on anything, from philosophy to politics, from sports to books and music.\" Filmfare wrote that earlier in his career, Khan gained a reputation for being arrogant, but later matured into \"one of showbiz\u2019s biggest and most respected stars.\" During his career, he has played roles in both high-profile mainstream productions and lesser-publicised films of independent filmmakers, and has appeared in a range of film genres, although he has found a niche playing roles in romantic comedies. The Tribune wrote that his roles in Dil Chahta Hai (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Hum Tum (2004), Salaam Namaste (2005) and Love Aaj Kal (2009) were \"essentially endearing pretty boys\", and the success of these films established him as the \"poster boy for romantic comedies\". Beth Watkins explains the typical role Khan played in romantic comedies and its appeal: \"Perhaps related is his finesse for playing petulant, arrogant, almost insufferable young men in need of reform, which, this being Bollywood, they can easily achieve through the love of a good woman. Does his real-life golden status\u2014with literature, cinema, cricket and royalty in his lineage\u2014make him exceptionally effective at coming across as spoiled?\" One of the highest-paid actors in Bollywood, Khan is considered among the most popular and high-profile celebrities in India. He is known to commit heavily to each role and believes in \"staying on a sharp learning curve\". Analysing his career, the journalist Shomini Sen noted that \"[t]he actor was part of some major films in the early 1990s [...] yet critics wrote him of[f] due to lack of a screen presence and poor dialogue delivery.\" Critics noted that Dil Chahta Hai marked a major turning point for Khan, and credited him for pioneering a movement in actors being part of \"a new genre of films which was more urban\"; film historian Nasreen Munni Kabir stated that the film helped him find \"his own style, combining great comic timing and a natural personality.\" Sen further explained that \"his anglicized upbringing, which initially was a hindrance to his career, became his strongest point.\" Following his portrayal of a variety of character types in Ek Hasina Thi (2004), Parineeta (2005), Being Cyrus and Omkara (both 2006), Khan was noted for his versatility; India Today attributed his roles in these films to the establishment of a new image for leading actors in Bollywood, and The Tribune published that Khan had successfully \"matured, both as an actor of substance and as a bankable star. Starting in 2007, Khan's relationship with Kareena Kapoor became one of the country's most-reported celebrity stories, and they were listed amongst the top celebrity couple endorsers for brands and products worldwide. In a blog published by The Wall Street Journal, Rupa Subramanya described their marriage as India's \"wedding and social event of the year\". Kapoor gave birth to their son Taimur in December 2016. From 2012\u201316, Khan has featured on Forbes India's \"Celebrity 100,\" a list based on the income and popularity of India's celebrities. He peaked at the fifteenth position in 2012 and 2014 with an estimated annual earning of \u20b9642 million (US$9.9\u00a0million) and \u20b9629 million (US$9.7\u00a0million) respectively. In 2003, Khan placed fourth on Rediff's list of \"Top Bollywood Male Stars\". He was later ranked second in 2005, sixth in 2006 and seventh in 2007. In March 2011, Khan placed fifth on Rediff's list of \"Top 10 Actors of 2000\u20132010\". He was ranked among the top 30 on The Times of India's listing of the \"Most Desirable Men\" from 2010 to 2015, and has additionally featured in the UK magazine Eastern Eye's \"World's Sexiest Asian Men\" list in 2008, 2011 and 2012. In 2010 and from 2012\u201314, Khan was featured as one of the best-dressed male celebrities by the Indian edition of GQ magazine. Among Khan's film awards are a National Film Award for Best Actor and six Filmfare Awards out of nine nominations: Best Male Debut for Aashiq Awara (1993), Best Performance in a Comic Role for Dil Chahta Hai (2001) and Hum Tum (2004), Best Supporting Actor for Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Best Performance in a Negative Role for Omkara (2006) and the \"Moto Look of the Year\" for Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003)."

        "artist_name": "Saira_Banu", 
        "biography": " Saira Banu (born 23 August 1944), also known as Saira Bano, is an Indian Hindi film actress and the wife of the film actor Dilip Kumar. She acted in many Bollywood films between 1961 and 1988.   Saira Banu was born in India to actress Naseem Banu and film producer Mian Ehsan-ul-Haq, who produced the film Phool in Mumbai and film Wadah in Pakistan. Her maternal grandmother was the courtesan Chamiyan Bai, also known as Shamshad Begum of Delhi (not to be confused with the famous playback singer of yesteryear Shamshad Begum who was from Amritsar, Punjab). Her niece is former actress Shaheen Banu who is the daughter of her brother Sultan. Saira spent a significant part of her childhood in London, and went to finishing school. Her maternal grandmother was from Hasanpur (Uttar Pradesh). Her paternal grandfather, Muhammad Suleman, was an architect who served as the Chief Engineer of New Delhi and was later involved in the construction of Jinnah's Mazar in Karachi. Her paternal grandmother, Khatoon Begum, was from Old Delhi's Mohalla Churiwalan and a daughter of the scholar Khan Bahadur Maulvi Abdul Ahad (1849-1920). Her paternal grand-aunt, Khadeeja Begum, was married to the Shahi Imam of the Jama Masjid in Delhi, Ahmed Bukhari. Saira Banu was 16 years old in 1960, the year she made her debut to Hindi films. She said in a programme that she had basic talent and little dancing experience. Her peers all were classically trained, which was why she wasn't put in the top league. Saira started taking Kathak and Bharata Natyam lessons with success and trained herself professionally. Soon she became a dancer and her films flaunted more of her dance. Banu made her acting debut opposite Shammi Kapoor in the 1961 film Junglee for which she earned her first Filmfare nomination as Best Actress. The famous song from this movie \"Yaahoo!! Chahe Koi Mujhe Junglee Kahe\" sung by Mohammed Rafi was a big success. 'Junglee' was written by Aghajani Kashmeri (aka Kashmiri and Agha Jani), who also coached her in Urdu dialogue delivery, given his background in Urdu literature and poetry from Lucknow. 'Junglee' also instantly made her a successful actress throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Her image was that of a romantic heroine for love stories in the 1960s till 1967. She did one more film opposite Shammi Kapoor named Bluff Master directed by Manmohan Desai. Some of her successful romantic films include Jhuk Gaya Aasman and Aayi Milan Ki Bela' with Rajendra Kumar and April Fool with Biswajeet and 5 films with actor Joy Mukherjee - Aao Pyar Karen, Saaz Aur Awaaz, Door Ki Awaz, Yeh Zindagi Kitni Haseen Hai and Shagird. She did a double role in the film Yeh Zindagi Kitni Haseen Hai. After her marriage in 1966, her first film to release was Aman opposite Rajendra Kumar and she continued to act as the lead heroine till 1977. But it is said that the turning point of her career was the comedy and love story Padosan in 1968 opposite Sunil Dutt, which brought her to the top league of the successful actresses and she started receiving more offers. Her films with Navin Nishchol were very successful like Victoria No. 203 and Paise Ki Gudiya. In an interview she quoted that she regretted missing chance of working with Rajesh Khanna. She quoted \"I was supposed to work with him in 'Choti Bahu'(1971) but I could not because I was ill. I shot with him for two days and found that he was very charming, humble and a shy person\". She did earn three additional Filmfare nominations as Best Actress for Shagird (1967), Diwana (1968), and Sagina (1974). Her valiant attempts to establish a reputation as an actress after Sagina and Bairaag (all 3 with Dilip Kumar) and films like Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Chaitali met with limited success although each of them were critically acclaimed. Her only film to be successful at box office opposite her husband was Gopi. She also had stable pairing with Dharmendra which included Jwar Bhata, Aadmi Aur Insaan, Resham Ki Dori, Pocket Maar, International Crook, and Chaitali. She also did Pyar Mohabbat with Dev Anand and did two films with Manoj Kumar, namely Poorab Aur Paschim and Balidan. She established herself as versatile actor, post her marriage, with her performances in Padosan, Victoria 203, Jhuk Gaya Aasman, Sagina, Chaitali - with each of them belonging to different genres. She was paired with Vinod Khanna in Aarop wherein the song Naino Mein Darpan Hai became a chartbuster in 1974. Her pairing with Sunil Dutt continued to be good at box office with films like Nehle Pe Dehla being successful in 1976. The song Sawan Ka Mahina Aagaya became very popular in 1976. However, with films like Daaman Aur Aag, Mounto, Zameer, Koi Jeeta Koi Haara becoming disasters and with some of her films being kept on hold for release like Faisla, Mera Vachan Geeta Ki Kasam, Aarambh, she decided to not sign any more films. Hence in 1976, Saira chose to end her film career. Subsequently she weathered a storm in her marriage in 1980, when her husband married a girl named Asma, which was quickly resolved. She then appeared in a cameo opposite her husband in Duniya (1984) wherein the song Teri Meri Zindagi became very popular. Her last film Faisla where she was cast opposite Vinod Mehra which was completed in 1976 released in 1988. Saira Banu married actor Dilip Kumar in 1966."

For Tere Naam, (2003) Taran Adarsh said of him, \"Salman Khan is exceptional in a role that fits him to the T. He breathes fire in sequences that demand uneasiness. But beneath the tough exterior lies a vulnerable person and this facet in particular comes to the fore in the latter reels. His emotional outbursts are splendid...\" Tere Naam is to date considered Salman Khan's best film with critically acclaimed performance. He subsequently continued his success at the box office, with comedies like Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004) and No Entry (2005).

His driver Ashok Singh, who had given the testimony that it was him who was driving the car at the time of accident, was charged with perjury for misguiding the Court with false testimony and was arrested. The kidnapping and eventual death of prime witness Police Constable Ravindra Patil remains a mystery, with some suspecting the involvement of organised crime. In December 2015, Khan was acquitted of all charges from this case, due to lack of evidence. The Supreme Court on Tuesday July 5, 2016 admitted a plea by the Maharashtra government that challenged the acquittal of Salman Khan in this hit-and-run case by the Bombay High Court. The court refused to fast-track the case. His relationship with actress Aishwarya Rai was a well publicized topic in the Indian media. After their break-up in March 2002, Rai accused him of harassing her. She claimed that Khan had not been able to come to terms with their break-up and was hounding her; her parents lodged a complaint against him. In 2005, news outlets released what was said to be an illicit copy of a mobile phone call recorded in 2001 by the Mumbai police. It appeared to be a call in which he threatened Rai, in an effort to force her to appear at social events held by Mumbai crime figures. The call featured boasts of connections to organised crime and derogatory comments about other actors. However, the alleged tape was tested in the government's Forensic lab in Chandigarh, which concluded that it was fake. The case involves the alleged killing of a deer when Salman Khan and his co-stars - Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre, Neelam and Tabu - were shooting for 'Hum Saath Saath Hain' in the forests near Jodhpur in 1998. In 2007, Salman had spent a week in Jodhpur jail before the court granted him bail. Besides the cases of poaching of endangered antelopes under Wildlife (Protection) Act, a case under sections 3/25 and 3/27 of the Arms Act was filed against Khan for allegedly keeping and using the fire arms with expired licence in the poaching of blackbucks in Kankani near Jodhpur on October 1\u20132, 1998. On 17 February 2006, Khan was sentenced to one year in prison for hunting the Chinkara, an endangered species. The sentence was stayed by a higher court during appeal. On 10 April 2006, he was handed a five-year jail term and remanded to Jodhpur jail until 13 April when he was granted bail. On 24 July 2012, Rajasthan High Court finalized charges against Salman Khan and his other colleagues in the endangered blackbuck killing case, paving way for start of the trial. On 9 July 2014, Supreme Court issued a notice to Salman on Rajasthan government's plea challenging the HC order suspending his conviction. Salman Khan was acquitted in the blackbuck and chinkara poaching cases by the Rajasthan High Court on Monday 24 July 2016. On 18 October 2016 the Rajasthan Government decided to approach Supreme Court against Salman Khan's acquittal in two cases related to chinkara (black buck) poaching case. On January 18, 2017: Salman Khan was acquitted by a Jodhpur court in an Arms Act case linked to killing of a blackbuck in Rajasthan. Khan pleaded 'not guilty' to charges of violating the law by keeping unlicensed weapons and using them. Acquitting the actor, the court said that the prosecution failed to submit enough evidence against the actor. On September 2010, Khan was reported to have claimed during an interview to a Pakistani channel that the 26/11 attacks got a lot of attention because the \"elite\" were targeted. During the interview the actor had said: \"It was the elite that was targeted this time. Five star hotels and stuff. So they panicked. Then they got up and spoke about it. My question is why not before. Attacks have happened in trains and small towns too, but no one talked about it so much.\" Khan also said that Pakistan was not to be blamed for it, and that the Indian security forces had failed. Khan's comments had drawn strong reactions from Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra Chagan Bhujbal, Shiv Sena, BJP and other political parties. The comments were also condemned by Ujwal Nikam, Special Prosecutor in the 26/11 trial. Khan later apologized for his comments. On 25 July 2015, Khan made a number of tweets from his Twitter account in support of the 1993 Bombay bombings accuse Yakub Memon. Memon was scheduled to be executed, before which Khan made his tweets. Khan said that Yakub's brother, Tiger Memon should be hanged instead. He also asked the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif to confirm \"whether the mob boss is in his country.\" The tweets sparked protests outside his house where police had to be deployed, and was criticised in the social media and from his father, Salim Khan. Following these incidents, Khan withdrew his tweets and apologised. On September 2016, Khan made a statement saying that, \"They (Pakistani) are artists not terrorists. It\u2019s the government who gives them permits and visas\". Khan has sung the following Hindi songs for Bollywood films:[citation needed]"

        "biography": " Sanjay Balraj Dutt (born 29 July 1959) is an Indian film actor and producer known for his work in Hindi cinema (Bollywood). The son of veteran Hindi film actors Sunil Dutt and Nargis Dutt, he made his acting debut in 1981 and has since appeared in more than 100 Hindi films. Although Dutt has enjoyed great success as a lead actor in genres ranging from romance to comedy, it has been the roles of gangsters, thugs and police officers in the drama and action genres that have won him much appreciation. The Indian media and audiences alike popularly refer to him as Deadly Dutt for his larger-than-life portrayals of such characters. In a film career spanning more than 35 years, Dutt has won two Filmfare Awards, two IIFA Awards, two Bollywood Movie Awards, three Screen Awards, three Stardust Awards, a Global Indian Film Award and a Bengal Film Journalist's Association Award. He has played the lead in four films that have won national awards. Dutt was arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act in April 1993. Charges of terrorism were dropped but he was convicted of illegal possession of armaments. After serving his sentence with good behaviour and conduct, he was released on 25 February 2016.   Dutt was born to Hindi cinema actors Sunil Dutt and Nargis. His mother died in 1981, shortly before his debut film's premiere; her death has been cited as the cause of his drug addictions. As a child actor, Dutt appeared in the 1972 film Reshma Aur Shera, which starred his father; he appears briefly as a qawali singer. Dutt married actress Richa Sharma in 1987. Sharma died of brain tumour in 1996. The couple have a daughter, Trishala, born in 1988, who lives in the United States with her grandparents, following a custody battle with Dutt after the death of his wife. Dutt's second marriage was to model Rhea Pillai in 1998. They divorced in 2005. Dutt married Manyata (born Dilnawaz Sheikh) in 2008 in a private ceremony in Goa, after two years of dating. On 21 October 2010, he became a father to twins, a boy named Shahraan and a girl named Iqra. Sanjay Dutt made his Bollywood movie debut with the box office hit Rocky in 1981. He went on to star in Vidhaata, the highest grossing Hindi film of 1982 along with the super hit Main Awara Hoon (1983). In 1985 he shot for his first film in three years, Jaan ki Baazi (1985). This was Sanjay's first film post what is now referred to as his drug phase years, when personal problems and a number of films that had been completed before his departure to the USA flopped at the box office, after which he had contemplated not returning to films. Jaan ki Baazi marked a comeback for Dutt and he appeared in successful films throughout the 80s such as Imaandaar, Inaam Dus Hazaar, Jeete Hain Shaan Se (1988), Mardon Wali Baat (1988), Ilaaka (1989), Hum Bhi Insaan Hain (1989), Kanoon Apna Apna (1989), and Taaqatwar (1989).[citation needed] The 1986 blockbuster Naam (1986 film) was Dutt's first major critical success and a turning point in his career, the film firmly cemented him amongst India's finest young mainstream leading actors as he earned praise for his portrayal of an illegal immigrant in Dubai who spirals into a life of crime. His performances in both Kabzaa (1988) and J. P. Dutta's 1989 Hathyar. were also both well received by critics although both films only managed average collections at the box office. In the late 1980s he was seen in a number of multi-starrers alongside actors like Govinda, Mithun, Dharmendra, Jackie Shroff and Sunny Deol. His successes continued in the 1990s, with films that include Tejaa, Khatarnaak, Zahreelay, Thanedaar, Khoon Ka Karz, Yalgaar, Gumrah, Sahibaan, and Aatish: Feel the Fire. He went on to star in some of the most era-defining Indian films of the early 1990s such as Sadak, Saajan (for which he was nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award) and Khal Nayak, for which he earned his second Filmfare Best Actor Award nomination. Three weeks before its release, however, in April 1993, he was arrested, charged with involvement in the 1993 Mumbai bombings. Dutt was unable to act for the next four years due to his subsequent arrests and bails although many incomplete films released featuring Dutt during this time that all sank without a trace, the 1994 hit Aatish with Aditya Pancholi, being the only exception, which was completed before his 1993 arrest.[citation needed] Dutt's first film after his 1993 arrest 1997's Daud which did not manage to sustain its phenomenal opening at the box office and was declared a box office flop.[citation needed] He followed this up with the 1998 Dushman but all credit for the film's success was given to lead actress Kajol. 1999 was an excellent year for Dutt and one that is truly regarded as his comeback year, with all his five releases being amongst the highest-grossing films of that year. He began the year by starring in the Mahesh Bhatt-directed hit Kartoos, followed by Khoobsurat, Daag: The Fire, Haseena Maan Jayegi and the award-winning Vaastav: The Reality, for which he won his first Filmfare Best Actor Award.[citation needed] His role in 2000's Mission Kashmir won him critical acclaim and a number of awards and nominations, as did his subsequent performance in Kurukshetra.[citation needed] As the decade went on, he continued to play lead roles in popular and critical successes such as Jodi No.1 (2001), Pitaah (2002), Kaante (2002) and the National Award-winning blockbuster Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. (2003), which garnered him several awards.[citation needed] Later successes came with Musafir (2004), Plan (2004), Parineeta (2005) and Dus (2005). He won critical acclaim for his performances in Shabd (2005) and Zinda although both films only fared averagely at the box office.[citation needed] The blockbuster sequel Lage Raho Munna Bhai was released in late 2006. He received a number of awards for his performance in the film along with an award from the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for his work in the Munna bhai series. In the same year news channel NDTV named him Indian of the Year. He also sang and danced in a music video with Asha Bhosle called Asha and Friends, directed by S Ramachandran. Although he was going through a successful time professionally and receiving great acclaim for his performance in Lage Raho Munna Bhai, this coincided with the start of the Mumbai bombing's trial. The nation became transfixed with Dutt's court ongoings which saw him found not guilty of terrorism related acts but jailed for short periods on two occasions between 2006\u20132007, as he was found guilty under the Possession of Arms Act. He was granted bail, enabling him to star in successes like Dhamaal (2007), Shootout at Lokhandwala (2007), All the Best (2009), Double Dhamaal (2011), Son of Sardaar (2012) and Agneepath (2012) for which he won a number of awards as the psychotic villain Kaancha. His latest role was as a supporting character in the Bollywood film PK, which he completed before being sentenced to imprisonment in early 2013, for the possession of illegal arms verdict handed out to him in 2006. In January 2008, the Indian film Institute Filmfare listed 12 films featuring Dutt in its top 100 highest-grossing movies of all-time list. In its May 2013 edition 100 years of Indian cinema Filmfare listed three films featuring Dutt in its top 20 list of highest-grossing Hindi films of all time, adjusted for inflation these films were Lage Raho Munna Bhai, Khalnayak and Saajan.[citation needed] Vidhu Vinod Chopra announced on 29 September 2016 that production on the third Munna Bhai film starring Dutt in the title role will begin in 2017. Dutt co-hosted the fifth session of the Indian reality show Bigg Boss along with Salman Khan. The show aired on Colors television from 2 October 2011 to 7 January 2012. Dutt later said it was Khan who persuaded him to co-host the show. Dutt and entrepreneur Indian Premier League-cricket team owner Raj Kundra together launched India's first professionally- organised mixed martial arts league\u00a0\u2014 the Super Fight League\u00a0\u2014 on 16 January 2012. Bombay suffered a series of serial bombings in 1993. Dutt was among several people associated with Bollywood who were accused of involvement. Dutt was accused of accepting a delivery of weapons at his house from Abu Salem and co-accused Riyaz Siddiqui, who had also been implicated in relation to the Mumbai blasts. It was claimed that the weapons formed a part of a large consignment of arms connected to the terrorists. In April 1993, he was arrested under the provisions of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act (TADA). Dutt was granted bail by the Supreme Court of India in October 1995 but was re-arrested in December 1995. He was again released on bail in April 1997. The case came to court in 2006 and during the period of 2006\u20132007, Dutt spent seven months in Arthur Road Jail and Pune prison on three occasions for the offences. Abdul Qayyum Abdul Karim Shaikh, who was thought to be a close aide of the terrorists' ringleader, Dawood Ibrahim, was arrested. Dutt had given Qayuum's name to the police when confessing to arms possession, saying that in September 1992 he had bought a pistol from Qayuum in Dubai. On 31 July 2007, the TADA court sentenced Dutt to six years' rigorous imprisonment for illegal possession of weapons and cleared him of charges relating to the Mumbai blasts. According to The Guardian, \"The actor claimed he feared for his life after the notorious \"Black Friday\" bombings, which were allegedly staged by Mumbai's Muslim-dominated mafia in retaliation for deadly Hindu-Muslim clashes a few months earlier. But the judge rejected this defence and also refused bail.\" Dutt was returned to jail at Arthur Road and soon after moved to the Yerwada Central Jail in Pune. Dutt appealed against the sentence and was granted interim bail on 20 August 2007 until such time as the TADA court provided him with a copy of its judgement. On 22 October 2007 Dutt was back in jail but again applied for bail. On 27 November 2007, Dutt was granted bail by the Supreme Court. On 21 March 2013 the Supreme Court upheld the verdict of the TADA court but shortened the sentence to five years' imprisonment. Dutt was given a month to surrender before the authorities. Dutt has said that \"I am not a politician but I belong to a political family.\" He was persuaded by a close friend to contest the 2009 Lok Sabha elections as a candidate for the Samajwadi Party but withdrew when the court refused to suspend his conviction. He was then appointed General Secretary of the party, leaving that post in December 2010.  In March 2013 the Supreme Court upheld Dutt's five-year sentence, 18 months of which he already spent in jail during the trial. He was given four weeks to surrender to the authorities, the court having refused to release him on probation due to the severity of the offence. With analysts believing that his imprisonment would have a significant impact on the fortunes of Bollywood, people from the movie business made statements of support following the ruling and some said that they would be making appeals for him to be pardoned. On 10 May, the Supreme Court rejected Dutt's review petition for the reconsideration of his conviction and asked him to surrender on the stipulated date. On 13 May, the Supreme Court rejected appeals filed by two film producers who were seeking more time for the actor to surrender so that he could complete two of his under-production films. On 14 May, Dutt withdrew the mercy plea and surrendered to the Mumbai Police on 16 May 2013. Just before the surrender, the Mumbai jail authority got an anonymous letter threatening Dutt's life. Dutt filed an appeal to allow him to surrender before Yerwada Central Jail. Later, Dutt withdrew this request too. Dutt subsequently surrendered in court as ordered. He was paroled from 21 December 2013. The parole was extended three times until March 2014, raising concern in Mumbai High Court and a proposal from the Government of Maharashtra to amend the law of parole. He returned to Yerwada prison after his parole ended. Dutt was out on a two weeks' furlough granted by the Yerwada Central Jail authorities on 24 December. He said \"I have lost 18kg. Now if I lose any more weight, I will vanish.\" Sanjay Dutt was subsequently incarcerated in Yerwada Central Jail, to complete his jail term. After serving his sentence, Dutt was released from Yerwada Central Jail on 25 February 2016. A biopic is currently filming on the life of this actor. Actor Ranbir Kapoor is portraying this actor in his biopic."

        "biography": " Sanjay Suri is an Indian actor and producer from Bollywood. He made his debut in 1999 with Pyaar Mein Kabhi Kabhi. He went on to star in many supporting roles but finally got his big break with Jhankaar Beats in 2003, where audiences started to recognise him as a seasoned actor. He is co-producer and actor in the film I Am. He is also the co-founder of the film production company Anticlock Films.   Sanjay Suri was born on 6 April 1971, in Srinagar, Kashmir, where he spent 19 years of his life. He has an elder brother and elder sister. Living in Srinagar he developed a strong love for nature and the outdoors. As a child Suri was a star squash player and was on his school and state teams. In 1990 his father was killed in a terrorist attack and the family was forced to flee to Jammu where they briefly lived in a refugee camp. They then shifted to Delhi. Suri and his wife, Ambika, have two children.[citation needed] When Suri moved to New Delhi in 1990, he was thrust into the world of modelling. He modelled for many companies including Gillette, Nilkamal Furniture, Times of India, Philishave, and Nescafe. 1999 witnessed Suri's breakthrough in Bollywood with a supporting role in the movie Pyaar Mein Kabhi Kabhi, co-starring Rinke Khanna and Dino Morea. Although the movie flopped, Suri was noticed. His next films were Daman: A Victim of Marital Violence (2001), Filhaal... and the musical Dil Vil Pyar Vyar (2002). In 2003's Pinjar co-starring Urmila Matondkar he got rave reviews but it was not until Jhankaar Beats later that year that he became popular. His role alongside Juhi Chawla was greatly appreciated. Slowly he got more roles in movies, but his movies were not box office successes. Despite the failure of his films, his performances continued to be appreciated. In 2005 he delivered a critically acclaimed performance in My Brother... Nikhil, as a homosexual who happens to be HIV positive, once again co-starring Juhi Chawla. The movie received unanimous praise among Indian film critics. The movie fared decently in Mumbai, but was a failure elsewhere in India. His subsequent films have not done as well.[citation needed] Suri and Onir (who also directed My Brother Nikhil) also worked on Sorry Bhai! and under the banner of Anticlock Films have produced I Am which weaves together four stories on different topical issues. With this film they have ventured into a new mode of production involving crowdsourcing, a concept that had not been explored before in Indian cinema. The movie released on 29 April 2011 and went on to win the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. Sanjay Suri has been honoured by Sandeep Marwah with the membership of International Film and Television Club of Asian Academy of Film & Television. I AM co-produced and directed by Sanjay Suri, was awarded the David Flint honorary award for promoting Human rights. The film also won the best in Asian Cinema award (NETPAC) at the international kerala film festival 2010 and went on to win the audience choice award, best film at Florence 'River to River' festival 2010. Suri was a part of the Incredible India team that represented 'I AM' at the cannes film festival 2012."

She has a reputation for performing strong character roles. Biswas won the 1996 National Film Award for Best Actress for her role in the film Bandit Queen. She won the 2000 Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and the 2006 Best Actress Genie Award for her role as Shakuntala in Deepa Mehta's Water (2005).

She studied Political Science at Nalbari College, and later joined the National School of Drama, New Delhi. After graduating from NSD in 1984, she joined the NSD Repertory Company. Seema Biswas acted as the heroine in Krishnan Kartha's Amshini (Hindi) which entered the Indian Panorama Section of Filmotsav 1988. However the general belief is that Biswas debuted after Shekhar Kapur watched her perform in NSD Repertory Company, and offered her a role in Bandit Queen.

Rooted firmly in theatre, she refuses to be typecast, and has worked in a variety of films and character roles. She has also worked in a number of Marathi, Malayalam, and Tamil films. Some of her Marathi films are Bindhast, Dhyaas Parwa, and Lalbaug-Parel.

        "artist_name": "Shabana_Azmi", 
        "biography": " Shabana Azmi (born 18 September 1950) is an Indian actress of film, television and theatre. The daughter of poet Kaifi Azmi and stage actress Shaukat Azmi, she is the alumna of Film and Television Institute of India of Pune. Azmi made her film debut in 1974 and soon became one of the leading actresses of Parallel Cinema, a Bengali new-wave movement known for its serious content and neo-realism and received government patronage during the times. Regarded as one of the finest actresses in India, Azmi's performances in films in a variety of genres have generally earned her praise and awards, which include a record of five wins of the National Film Award for Best Actress and several international honours. She has also received five Filmfare Awards, and was honored among \"women in cinema\" at the 30th International Film Festival of India. In 1988, the Government of India awarded her with Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian honour of the country. Azmi has appeared in over 120 Hindi and Bengali films in both mainstream and independent cinema, and since 1988 she has acted in several foreign projects. Numerous of her films have been cited as a form of progressivism which portrays Indian society, its customs and traditions. In addition to acting, Azmi is a social and women's rights activist. She is the wife of poet and screenwriter Javed Akhtar. She is a Goodwill Ambassador of the United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA) which seeks to spread contraception and abortion in India in order to limit that country's population. In appreciation of Azmi's life and works, the Congress party's government gave her a nominated (unelected) membership of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of parliament.   Shabana Azmi was born into a Saiyyid Muslim family of Arab origin, in Hyderabad, India. Her parents are Kaifi Azmi (an Indian poet) and Shaukat Azmi (a veteran Indian People's Theatre Association stage actress), both of whom were members of the Communist Party of India. Her brother, Baba Azmi, is a cinematographer. Shabana was named at the age of eleven by Ali Sardar Jafri. Her parents used to call her Munni. Baba Azmi was named by Prof. Masood Siddiqui to Ahmer Azmi. Her parents had an active social life, and their home was always thriving with people and activities of the communist party. It was not unusual for her to wake up in the morning and find members of the communist party sleeping about, from a previous night's communist social that ran late. Early in childhood, the environment in her home inculcated into her a respect for family ties, social and human values; and her parents always supported her to develop a passion for intellectual stimulation and growth. Azmi did her schooling at the premier girls' school, Queen Mary School, Mumbai. She completed a graduate degree in Psychology from St. Xavier's College, Mumbai, and followed it with a course in acting at the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune. She described the reason she decided to attend the film institute, saying, \"I had the privilege of watching Jaya Bhaduri in a (Diploma) film, Suman, and I was completely enchanted by her performance because it was unlike the other performances I had seen. I really marvelled at that and said, 'My god, if by going to the Film Institute I can achieve that, that's what I want to do.'\" Azmi eventually topped the list of successful candidates of 1972. Azmi graduated from the FTII in 1973 and went on to sign on Khwaja Ahmad Abbas' Faasla and began work on Kanti Lal Rathod's Parinay as well. Her first release, however, was Shyam Benegal's directorial debut Ankur (1974). Belonging to the arthouse genre of neo-realistic films, Ankur is based on a true story which occurred in Hyderabad. Azmi played Lakshmi, a married servant and villager who drifts into an affair with a college student who visits the countryside. Azmi was not the original choice for the film, and several leading actresses of that time refused to do it. The film went on to become a major critical success, and Azmi won the National Film Award for Best Actress for her performances. Upperstall.com described her work in the film as \"an outstanding psychologically penetrating performance very different from those seen normally till then in mainstream Hindi cinema\", and famous independent filmmaker Satyajit Ray commented, \"In Ankur she may not have fitted immediately into her rustic surroundings, but her poise and personality are never in doubt. In two high pitched scenes, she pulls out the stops to firmly establish herself as one of our finest dramatic actresses\". She went on to receive the National Film Award consecutively for three years from 1983 to 1985 for her roles in movies, Arth, Khandhar and Paar. Another film Godmother (1999) earned her another National Film Award, taking her tally to five. Azmi\u2019s acting has been characterised by a real-life depiction of the roles played by her. In Mandi, she acted as a madam of a whorehouse. For this role, she put on weight and even chewed betel. Real life portrayals continued in almost all her movies. These included the role of a woman named Jamini resigned to her destiny in Khandhar and a typical urban Indian wife, homemaker and mother in Masoom. She also acted in experimental and parallel Indian cinema. Deepa Mehta\u2019s 1996 film Fire depicts her as a lonely woman, Radha, in love with her sister-in-law. The on-screen depiction of lesbianism (perhaps the first in Indian cinema) drew severe protests and threats from many social groups as well as by the Indian authorities. Her role as Radha brought her international recognition with the Silver Hugo Award for Best Actress at the 32nd Chicago Film Festival and Jury Award for Best Actress at Outfest, Los Angeles. She was the initial choice for Deepa Mehta's Water which was actually planned to hit the floors in 2000. Few scenes were already shot. Azmi had to shave her head with Nandita Das to portray the character of Shakuntala. However, due to political reasons, the film was shelved and later shot in 2005 with Seema Biswas replacing Azmi. Some of her notable films are Shyam Benegal's Nishant (1975), Junoon (1978), Susman (1986), and Antarnaad (1992); Satyajit Ray\u2019s Shatranj Ke Khiladi; Mrinal Sen\u2019s Khandhar, Genesis, Ek Din Achanak; Saeed Mirza\u2019s Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai; Sai Paranjpye\u2019s Sparsh and Disha; Gautam Ghose\u2019s Paar; Aparna Sen\u2019s Picnic and Sati; Mahesh Bhatt\u2019s Arth; Vinay Shukla\u2019s Godmother. Her other films include the commercially successful Manmohan Desai's Amar Akbar Anthony and Parvarish and Prakash Mehra\u2019s Jwalamukhi. Azmi starred in Hollywood productions such as John Schlesinger\u2019s Madame Sousatzka (1988) and Roland Joffe\u2019s City of Joy (1992). Azmi debuted on the small screen in a soap opera titled Anupama. She portrayed a modern Indian woman who, while endorsing traditional Indian ethos and values, negotiated more freedom for herself. She had participated in many stage plays, and notable among them include M. S. Sathyu\u2019s Safed Kundali (1980), based on The Caucasian Chalk Circle; and Feroz Abbas Khan's Tumhari Amrita with actor Farooq Sheikh, which ran for five years. She toured Singapore on an assignment with the Singapore Repertory Theatre Company, acting in Ingmar Bergman\u2019s adaptation of Ibsen\u2019s A Doll's House, which was directed by Rey Buono. Toured UK, Dubai and India with British production Happy Birthday Sunita by Theatre Company Rifco Arts in 2014. Pointing out the differences in all these media, she once remarked that theatre was really the actor\u2019s medium; the stage was actor\u2019s space; cinema was the director\u2019s medium; and television was a writer\u2019s medium.[citation needed] Shabana Azmi was engaged to Benjamin Gilani in late 1970s but the engagement was called off.  Later, she married Javed Akhtar, a lyricist, poet and Bollywood scriptwriter, on 9 December 1984, making her a member of the Akhtar-Azmi film family. It was Akhtar\u2019s second marriage, the first being with Bollywood scriptwriter, Honey Irani. However Shabana's parents objected to her being involved with a very much married man with 2 children (Farhan Akhtar and Zoya Akhtar). Indian actresses Farah Naaz and Tabu are her nieces and Tanvi Azmi is her sister-in-law. Azmi has been a committed social activist, active in supporting child survival and fighting AIDS and injustice in real life. Azmi has voiced her opinion on a variety of issues. Initially, her activism drew skepticism and was dubbed by some as a publicity gimmick. However, she proved her critics wrong and used her celebrity status to emerge as a high-profile social activist. She had participated in several plays and demonstrations denouncing communalism. In 1989, along with Swami Agnivesh and Asghar Ali Engineer, she undertook a four-day march for communal harmony from New Delhi to Meerut. Among the social groups whose causes she has advocated are slum dwellers, displaced Kashmiri Pandit migrants and victims of the earthquake at Latur (Maharashtra, India). The 1993 Mumbai riots appalled her and she emerged as a forceful critic of religious extremism. After the 11 September 2001 attacks, she opposed the advice of the grand mufti of Jama Masjid calling upon the Muslims of India to join the people of Afghanistan in their fight by retorting that the leader go there alone. She has campaigned against ostracism of victims of AIDS. A small film clip issued by the Government of India depicts an HIV positive child cuddled in her arms and saying: \"She does not need your rejection, she needs your love\". In a Bengali film named Meghla Akash she played the role of a physician treating AIDS patients. She has also given her voice to an HIV/AIDS education animated software tutorial created by the nonprofit organisation TeachAIDS. She talks extensively about her social activism in a 2-hour interview for Harvard Business School's Creating Emerging Markets project. Since 1989, she has been a member of the National Integration Council headed by the Prime Minister of India; a member of National AIDS Commission (of India); and was nominated (in 1997) as a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian parliament. In 1998, the United Nations Population Fund appointed her as its Goodwill Ambassador for India. She has acted in more than one hundred Hindi films, both in the mainstream as well as in Parallel Cinema. Several of her films have received attention in the international arena and Scandinavian countries, including at the Norwegian Film Institute, the Smithsonian Institution and the American Film Institute. She has appeared in a number of foreign films, most of which have won international acclaim, including John Schlesinger\u2019s Madame Sousatzka, Nicholas Klotz\u2019s Bengali Night, Roland Joffe\u2019s City of Joy, Channel 4\u2019s Immaculate Conception, Blake Edwards' Son of the Pink Panther, and Ismail Merchant\u2019s In Custody. Azmi has received the National Film Award for Best Actress five times, making her the overall most-awarded actor in the function: Winner: Nominated:"

        "biography": " Shahid Kapoor (pronounced\u00a0[\u0283a\u02d0\u0266\u026ad\u032a k\u0259\u02c8pu\u02d0r]; born 25 February 1981), also known as Shahid Khattar, is an Indian actor who appears in Hindi films. The son of actors Pankaj Kapur and Neelima Azeem, Kapoor was born in New Delhi. His parents separated when he was three, and he continued living with his mother. They moved to Mumbai when has was 10, where he joined Shiamak Davar's dance academy. Kapoor appeared as a background dancer in a few films of the 1990s, and was later featured in music videos and television commercials. Kapoor made his film debut in 2003 with a leading role in the romantic comedy Ishq Vishk, a sleeper hit for which he won a Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. He followed it with roles in several commercial failures before starring in Sooraj Barjatya's top-grossing family drama Vivah (2006). Kapoor earned nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for portraying a troubled businessman in Imtiaz Ali's romantic comedy Jab We Met (2007) and twin brothers in Vishal Bhardwaj's caper thriller Kaminey (2009). After appearing in another series of box office flops, he starred in the action film R... Rajkumar (2013)\u2014his highest-grossing release. In 2014, Kapoor portrayed the Hamlet character in Bhardwaj's acclaimed drama Haider, for which he won the Best Actor award at Filmfare. Two years later, he played a drug abusing singer in the crime drama Udta Punjab, which won him the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Cited in the media as one of the most attractive Indian celebrities, Kapoor maintains his popularity despite a fluctuating career trajectory. Initially recognised for portraying romantic roles, Kapoor has since taken on parts in action films and thrillers. He is the recipient of several awards, including three Filmfare Awards. In addition to acting, Kapoor supports charities, hosts award ceremonies, and has featured as a talent judge on the dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa Reloaded (2015). Following a romantic relationship with the actress Kareena Kapoor, he married Mira Rajput, a student from New Delhi, with whom he has a daughter.   Shahid Kapoor was born in New Delhi on 25 February 1981 to actor Pankaj Kapur and actor-dancer Neelima Azeem. His parents divorced when he was three years old; his father shifted to Mumbai (and married the actress Supriya Pathak) and Kapoor continued living in Delhi with his mother and maternal grandparents. His grandparents were journalists for the Russian magazine Sputnik, and Kapoor was particularly fond of his grandfather: \"He would walk me to school every single day. He would talk to me about dad, with whom he shared a great relationship, and read out his letters to me.\" His father, who was then a struggling actor in Mumbai, would visit Kapoor only once a year on his birthday. When Kapoor was 10, his mother, who was working as a dancer, moved to Mumbai to work as an actress. In Mumbai, Azeem went on to marry the actor Rajesh Khattar. Kapoor continued living with his mother and Khattar, until they separated in 2001. Kapoor continues to use the last name Khattar on his passport. He has a maternal half-brother from his mother's marriage to Khattar. From his father's marriage to Pathak, he has two paternal half-siblings. Kapoor was educated at the Gyan Bharati School in Delhi and Rajhans Vidyalaya in Mumbai. He later attended Mumbai's Mithibai College for three years. Kapoor was interested in dance from an early age, and at the age of 15, he joined Shiamak Davar's dance institute. As a student there, Kapoor appeared as a background dancer in the films Dil To Pagal Hai (1997) and Taal (1999), in which Davar served as choreographer. During a stage show at the institute, Kapoor performed in the songs \"Vogue\" and \"GoldenEye\" to a positive response from the audience; he described the experience as the first time that he \"felt like a star\". He later became an instructor at the institute. During this time, Kapoor accompanied a friend to an audition for a Pepsi commercial featuring the stars Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Rani Mukerji, but wound up with the part himself. He appeared in television commercials for the brands Kit Kat and Close-Up, among others, and featured in music videos for several performers, including the band Aryans and the singer Kumar Sanu. Kapoor also took on the job of an assistant director to his father on the 1998 television series Mohandas B.A.L.L.B. Having noticed Kapoor in the Aryans' music video \"Aankhon Mein\", the producer Ramesh Taurani was keen to cast him in a film. However, upon meeting him, Taurani thought Kapoor, who was 20 years old at the time, to be too young and underweight to become an actor, and encouraged him to wait for a few years. Kapoor, meanwhile, turned down a lead role in N. Chandra's sex comedy Style in hopes of working with Taurani. Taurani found a suitable project for Kapoor in the teenage romance Ishq Vishk (2003), which Ken Ghosh was directing for his company. Kapoor, who trained extensively for a bulkier physical build, was eventually hired. Before beginning work on the film, he attended acting workshops with Naseeruddin Shah and Satyadev Dubey. Ishq Vishk tells the story of Rajiv Mathur (Kapoor), a high-school student who engages in a romantic affair with two classmates of contrasting personalities (played by Amrita Rao and Shenaz Treasurywala). Kapoor was attracted to the idea of playing an unlikable lead since it was a departure from the traditional portrayal of teenage heroes in Indian films. Writing for The Hindu, the critic Ziya Us Salam did not find him to be \"hero material\", adding that \"boyhood seems to have overstayed on his face \u2013 but he is not necessarily bad in the acting department.\" The film, however, proved to be a sleeper hit at the box office and won Kapoor the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. Following his debut, Kapoor reunited with Ghosh in a film he considered to be drastically different from Ishq Vishk. The thriller Fida (2004) featured him as a love-struck student who is manipulated by a woman (Kareena Kapoor) and her lover (Fardeen Khan) to rob a bank. Despite criticising the film, Rama Sharma of The Tribune wrote that Kapoor \"shines in his role. He looks fresh. As an impulsive emotional and innocent guy, who is sucked into crime because of these very qualities, he manages to evoke your sympathies.\" Later that year, Kapoor appeared in the romantic comedy Dil Maange More in which he was paired opposite three women: Soha Ali Khan, Tulip Joshi, and Ayesha Takia. Patcy N of Rediff.com praised his dancing skills but was wary of his imitation of Shah Rukh Khan's acting style. Both his 2004 releases were commercially unsuccessful. The series of poorly received films continued in 2005, when all three of Kapoor's films failed at the box office. His first two releases that year were the comedies Deewane Huye Paagal and Vaah! Life Ho Toh Aisi!, both of which were largely panned. The former was plagiarised from the Hollywood film There's Something About Mary in which Kapoor played one of Rimi Sen's love interests; the critic Khalid Mohamed found Kapoor to be \"the only likeable element in this travesty\" but Namrata Joshi of Outlook labelled him \"colourless\" and criticised his pairing with Sen. His final role was that of a righteous teenager drawn towards a life of indulgence in John Matthew Matthan's drama Shikhar, co-starring Ajay Devgan, Bipasha Basu and Amrita Rao. The critic Sukanya Verma found Kapoor to be miscast as a village boy in the film, but noted that he was \"never short of spontaneity and youthful exuberance\". In 2006, Kapoor played opposite Kareena Kapoor in two films\u2014the thriller 36 China Town and the comedy Chup Chup Ke. In 36 China Town, a murder mystery from the director duo Abbas\u2013Mustan, Kapoor starred as one of the seven suspects in the murder of an heiress, and in the Priyadarshan-directed Chup Chup Ke, he played a depressed man who pretends to be deaf and mute. The former was his first commercial success since Ishq Vishk. Greater success came to Kapoor later that year when he starred alongside Amrita Rao in Sooraj Barjatya's romantic drama Vivah, a film depicting an arranged marriage. Made on a shoestring budget of \u20b9100 million (US$1.5\u00a0million), the film earned over \u20b9530 million (US$8.2\u00a0million) worldwide, and proved to be Kapoor's highest-grossing film to that point. Reviews of the film, however, were negative; Raja Sen termed the film a \"nightmare\" and wrote that Kapoor \"isn't offensively bad, doesn't ham it up like crazy, or speak in a weird accent. Having said that, he isn't an actor at all, standing around working on his boyish grin, simply chewing up the scenery. No screen presence at all.\" Kapoor found no success in his first release of 2007\u2014the ensemble comedy Fool & Final. However, his second release that year, the Imtiaz Ali-directed romantic comedy Jab We Met proved to be one of the top-grossing films of the year. The film tells the story of a troubled businessman (Kapoor) whose life undergoes a series of changes after he encounters a loquacious girl (Kareena Kapoor) on a train ride. Ali thought that Kapoor's previous roles failed to justify his acting potential, and thus approached him to portray a more complex character. The BBC noted on how \"endearing\" he was in the film and Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN wrote that he left an \"indelible impression with a performance that is understated and mature\" in a film he thought primarily belonged to Kareena Kapoor. For his performance, Kapoor received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. After featuring opposite Vidya Balan in the romantic comedy Kismat Konnection (2008), Kapoor played twin brothers, one with a lisp and the other with a stutter, in Vishal Bhardwaj's critically acclaimed caper thriller Kaminey (2009). In preparation, Kapoor met speech specialists and researched on the medical and mental aspects of the two conditions. To create a lean physique for one of the brothers, a look he considered to be \"radically different\" from his personal appearance, Kapoor practiced functional training and followed a rigorous diet. Writing for Variety, critic Joe Leydon reviewed that Kapoor \"impressively displays sufficiently variegated degrees of emotional intensity to sustain the illusion of two distinct characters. Just as important, he provides each sibling an appropriately elevated hunkiness quotient.\" Rediff.com listed Kapoor's performance as the best by a Bollywood actor in 2009 and he received a second Best Actor nomination at Filmfare. Kaminey earned over \u20b9700 million (US$11\u00a0million) worldwide. Kapoor's final release of 2009 was as a cricketer in Dil Bole Hadippa!, a romantic comedy co-starring Rani Mukerji. It was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival, but was a financial failure. In 2010, Kapoor reteamed with Ken Ghosh in Chance Pe Dance, a comedy-drama about a struggling actor, in which Kapoor's performance was described as \"uneven\" by Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis. He had a supporting role in Paathshaala, a drama about the education system in India, starring Nana Patekar, following which he starred in Yash Raj Films' Badmaash Company, a comedy-drama about a group of overambitious youngsters who become con men. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times praised Kapoor's look in the film, though Tushar Joshi of Mid Day thought that he was miscast. Kapoor's fourth and final release that year was Satish Kaushik's romantic comedy Milenge Milenge, which marked his fourth collaboration with Kareena Kapoor. Plagiarised from the Hollywood film Serendipity, the production was delayed since 2005. During its production in December 2004 at Phuket, Kapoor requested a delay in filming to attend the premiere of Dil Maange More. The delay may have saved the lives of the crew, since the hotel booked for them was destroyed during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. With the exception of Badmaash Company, none of these films performed well commercially. Kapoor next appeared in his father's directorial Mausam (2011); co-starring Sonam Kapoor, the star-crossed romance set over a decade, took two years to complete. Considering the film to be his \"dream project\", Kapoor did not take on additional work while filming for it. For his role as an unambitious village boy who becomes an air force pilot, Kapoor trained to fly the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Rajeev Masand reviewed that \"while he doesn\u2019t quite cut it as a convincing IAF pilot, Shahid Kapoor is terrific as the small-town brat\". The film was a box office flop and Kapoor was later regretful for spending so much time on the project. The following year, Kapoor took on another romantic role in Kunal Kohli's Teri Meri Kahaani (2012), co-starring Priyanka Chopra. It tells the story of a pair of star-crossed lovers who are reincarnated in three different eras. Filmfare reviewed that \"Shahid and Priyanka give it their best shot, but their charm doesn\u2019t make up for the absence of a genuine kahani [story]\". The comedy Phata Poster Nikhla Hero from director Rajkumar Santoshi was Kapoor's first release of 2013. His role was that of Vishwas Rao, a struggling actor who masquerades as a policeman. Critical reviews on the film were negative, though Kapoor's performance was praised. As with his last few releases, the film earned little at the box office leading trade analysts to question his commercial appeal. This changed later that year, when he starred in Prabhu Deva's action film R... Rajkumar; despite a negative critical reception, the film earned over \u20b9995 million (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide, becoming Kapoor's highest-grossing release. In a scathing review, Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV called the film a \"massive mess\" and wrote that Kapoor \"ends up looking more moronic than macho\" in it. Kapoor suffered from burn injuries on his back and hands while filming a stunt sequence in R... Rajkumar. Kapoor next reunited with director Vishal Bhardwaj to film Haider (2014), an adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet set during the Kashmir conflict of 1995, in which he played the titular role opposite Tabu and Shraddha Kapoor. Kapoor described the film as the \"toughest\" of his career, and waived his fees to star in it. For the role, he shaved his head and learned to speak in a Kashmiri dialect. Haider garnered critical acclaim, though was controversial among Indian nationalists for its portrayal of the conflict in Kashmir. Sanjukta Sharma of Mint found the film to be an \"immensely effective reimagination of Shakespeare\" and particularly praised Kapoor for playing his part with \"impressive zest and inventiveness\". Writing for Hindustan Times, critic Anupama Chopra wrote that Kapoor initially seemed uncomfortable in the complex central role, but added that he \"slowly [...] comes to inhabit Haider, veering from rage to jealousy to madness in a heartbeat.\" Kapoor won several awards for the role, including the Screen Award, Producers Guild Film Award and Filmfare Award for Best Actor. The year 2015 saw Kapoor feature as a talent judge on the dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa Reloaded. His sole film release that year was opposite Alia Bhatt in Vikas Bahl's Shaandaar, a romantic comedy about two insomniacs who fall in love during a destination wedding. Despite high expectations from trade analysts, the film earned negative reviews and emerged as a commercial failure. Kapoor next took on the role of a drug abusing rock star in Udta Punjab (2016), a crime drama from the director Abhishek Chaubey that documents the substance abuse endemic in the Indian state of Punjab. Kapoor, a teetotaler, found it challenging to play a character who he deemed to be \"all about addiction\". He based the role on several pop stars, and was particularly interested in bringing out the character's hidden vulnerability despite his obnoxious actions. Udta Punjab generated controversy when the Central Board of Film Certification demanded extensive censorship before its theatrical release, citing that the portrayal of Punjab in it was negative. The demands sparked a broad debate about the freedom of expression in India. After the producers of the film filed lawsuit against the board, the Bombay High Court cleared the film for exhibition with a single scene cut, in which Kapoor's character is shown urinating on people. In a highly positive review, Sukanya Verma took note of the film's anti-drug message; in addition, she considered Kapoor to be \"spectacularly unbridled\" in his part and added that \"the believability he brings to his complex transition while preserving his inherent flakiness deserves all the praise\". Kapoor won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor (shared with Manoj Bajpayee for Aligarh) and received a Best Actor nomination at the same ceremony. In his third collaboration with Vishal Bharadwaj, an epic romance set during World War II entitled Rangoon (2017), Kapoor played the part of a taciturn soldier who develops a romance with a film actress (played by Kangana Ranaut). Filming was marred by a reported feud between Ranaut and Kapoor, and although they denied the reports, both stars publicly commented against the other. The film received mixed reviews; Rajeev Masand termed the film \"overlong, indulgent to the point of exhaustion\", but praised Kapoor for playing his part with \"remarkable maturity\". In addition, Uday Bhatia of Mint was appreciative of the chemistry between Ranaut and Kapoor. As of March 2017, Kapoor is filming the part of Rana Rawal Ratan Singh, a 14th-century Rajasthani ruler, in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's historical drama Padmavati, co-starring Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh. Kapoor's personal life is the subject of fervent tabloid reporting in India. During the filming of Fida in 2004, he began dating Kareena Kapoor and they both publicly spoke of the relationship. They were involved in a well-publicised scandal when Mid Day published a set of pictures of them kissing in public. Despite claims by the couple that the pictures were fabricated, the newspaper denied any wrongdoing. The couple separated in 2007 during the filming of Jab We Met. Since their split, Kapoor decided to keep his personal life away from media attention. However, tabloids speculated on his relationship with several other actresses, including Vidya Balan and Priyanka Chopra. In March 2015, Kapoor spoke of his impending marriage to Mira Rajput, a student from New Delhi, who is 13 years his junior. The Times of India reported that Kapoor met Rajput through the religious group Radha Soami Satsang Beas. The couple married at a private ceremony in Gurgaon on 7 July 2015, and Rajput later gave birth to their daughter, Misha Kapoor, on 26 August 2016. In addition to acting in films, Kapoor performs on stage and hosts award ceremonies. In 2006, he participated in a world tour, entitled RockStars, in which he performed alongside Kareena Kapoor, John Abraham, Salman Khan and three other celebrities. From 2010\u201312, Kapoor has co-hosted three Screen Awards ceremonies with Shah Rukh Khan, and from 2012\u201314 he co-hosted three International Indian Film Academy Awards with either Khan or Farhan Akhtar. Kapoor practices vegetarianism, and credits the author Brian Hines' book Life is Fair for influencing this lifestyle choice. He also supports charitable organisations for various causes. In 2010, he took part in a charity event named Superstars Ka Jalwa, which helped generate money for the employees of the Cine and Television Artists Association (CINTAA). Also that year, he lent his support to the NGO Swayamsiddh, which helps children with special needs. The following year, he adopted three villages in support of NDTV's Greenathon, an initiative to support environmental consciousness and improve electricity supplies to rural areas. In 2012, Kapoor helped revive the Victory Arts Foundation NGO, founded by Shiamak Davar, which helps underprivileged children through dance therapy programs. Also that year, he appeared alongside other Bollywood celebrities in Because My World Is Not The Same, a short film by Zoya Akhtar, to generate awareness on breast cancer. He supports the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals organisation through advertisement campaigns. The journalist Dave Besseling of GQ, in 2014, described Kapoor as \"friendly, chirpy, affable frat-boy type. Someone you\u2019d want to play video games with on a Sunday, but keep the hell away from your sister\". However, certain media publications have labelled Kapoor a recluse and described him as arrogant and temperamental. Vickey Lalwani of Mumbai Mirror wrote in 2012 that this perceived media image hindered certain filmmakers from approaching him for roles. Addressing this image, Kapoor remarked, \"I just don\u2019t socialise much, I don\u2019t party too much, I don\u2019t know what to say to the media if I\u2019m not talking about a film that I am doing, so yeah, maybe I am perceived as a snob.\" Analysing his career, the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama published that his \"boy next door persona\" was initially perceived by critics as a weakness, but credited him for turning it into a trademark. Jitesh Pillai of Filmfare wrote that after gaining recognition in urban romantic roles, Kapoor defied typecasting by taking on diverse parts in crime dramas and action films. He noted that Kapoor's refusal to be \"slotted under any kind of tag\" led to a fluctuating career trajectory. Following the success of Jab We Met (2007) and Kaminey (2009), Kapoor's career went through a decline; he described the phase as a series of \"wrong choices\" and said that taking on a challenging role in Haider (2014) helped him reinvent himself. Sonal Gera of The Indian Express opined that the film established him in Bollywood. In her book Power of a Common Man, the author Koral Dasgupta writes that Kapoor does not \"[conform] to any fixed rules of the trade\", and notes that despite having a lopsided success ratio at the box office, he remains popular among the audiences. A popular celebrity, Kapoor has a significant following on Twitter and Instagram. Considered one of the most attractive male celebrities in India, he regularly features in the British magazine Eastern Eye's listing of the \"50 Sexiest Asian Men in the World\". In 2012 and 2013 he was ranked fourth, and in 2014 he came in fifth. He was ranked fifth on The Times of India's list of the 50 most-desirable men in 2014; he was placed among the top 10 in 2012, 2013 and 2015. Kapoor was named the sexiest vegetarian man of India and Asia-Pacific in 2009 and 2011, respectively, by PETA. From 2012\u201315, he featured among the top 50 in the Indian edition of the Forbes' \"Celebrity 100,\" a list based on the income and popularity of India's celebrities, peaking at the 15th position in 2015. Kapoor is the celebrity ambassador for several brands and products, including Samsung, Elf Aquitaine and Colgate. Kapoor has been the recipient of three Filmfare Awards: Best Male Debut for Ishq Vishk (2003), Best Actor for Haider (2014), and Critics Award for Best Actor for Udta Punjab (2016). He has received three more Best Actor nominations at the ceremony for Jab We Met (2007), Kaminey (2009) and Udta Punjab (2016)."

        "artist_name": "Shah_Rukh_Khan", 
        "biography": " Shah Rukh Khan (born Shahrukh Khan; 2 November 1965), also known as SRK, is an Indian film actor, producer and television personality. Referred to in the media as the \"Baadshah of Bollywood\", \"King of Bollywood\" or \"King Khan\", he has appeared in more than 80 Bollywood films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14\u00a0Filmfare Awards. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, he has been described as one of the most successful film stars in the world. Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s. He made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with Deewana. Early in his career, Khan was recognised for portraying villainous roles in the films Darr (1993), Baazigar (1993) and Anjaam (1994). He then rose to prominence after starring in a series of romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000) and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in Swades (2004), a hockey coach in Chak De! India (2007) and a man with Asperger syndrome in My Name Is Khan (2010). His highest-grossing films include the comedies Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014). Many of his films display themes of Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances. For his contributions to film, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri, and the Government of France awarded him both the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. As of 2015, Khan is co-chairman of the motion picture production company Red Chillies Entertainment and its subsidiaries, and is the co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders. He is a frequent television presenter and stage show performer. The media often label him as \"Brand SRK\" because of his many endorsement and entrepreneurship ventures. Khan's philanthropic endeavours have provided health care and disaster relief, and he was honoured with UNESCO's Pyramide con Marni award in 2011 for his support of children's education. He regularly features in listings of the most influential people in Indian culture, and in 2008, Newsweek named him one of their fifty most powerful people in the world.   Khan was born on 2 November 1965 in a Muslim family in New Delhi. He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Ifthikar Ahmed, served as the chief engineer of the port in the 1960s.[a] According to Khan, his paternal grandfather, Jan Muhammad, an ethnic Pathan was from Afghanistan. Shah Rukh Khan also said in his interviews that he is a Pathan from Peshawar and his entire family used to speak Hindko language at home. Khan's father, Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist in Peshawar, British India (present-day Pakistan). As of 2010, Khan's paternal family was still living in Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar's Qissa Khawani Bazaar. Meer was a follower of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and affiliated with the All Indian National Congress. He moved to New Delhi in 1948 partition of India. Khan's mother, Lateef Fatima, was the daughter of a senior government engineer.[b] His parents were married in 1959. Khan described himself on Twitter as \"half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), [and] some Kashmiri (grandmother)\". His paternal cousins in Peshawar claim that the family is of Hindkowan origin from Kashmir, not Pashtun, and also contradict the claim that his grandfather was from Afghanistan. Khan grew up in the Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood of Delhi. His father had several business ventures including a restaurant, and the family lived a middle-class life in rented apartments. Khan attended St. Columba's School in central Delhi where he excelled in his studies and in sports such as hockey and football, and received the school's highest award, the Sword of Honour. In his youth, he acted in stage plays and received praise for his imitations of Bollywood actors, of which his favourites were Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan and Mumtaz. One of his childhood friends and acting partners was Amrita Singh, who became a Bollywood actress. Khan enrolled at Hansraj College (1985\u201388) to earn his bachelor's degree in Economics, but spent much of his time at Delhi's Theatre Action Group (TAG), where he studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John. After Hansraj, he began studying for a master's degree in Mass Communications at Jamia Millia Islamia, but left to pursue his acting career. He also attended the National School of Drama in Delhi during his early career in Bollywood. His father died of cancer in 1981,[c] and his mother died in 1991 from complications of diabetes. After the death of their parents, his older sister, Shahnaz Lalarukh, born in 1960, fell into a depressed state and Khan took on the responsibility of caring for her. Shahnaz continues to live with her brother and his family in their Mumbai mansion. Although Khan was given the birth name Shahrukh Khan, he prefers his name to be written as Shah Rukh Khan, and is commonly referred to by the acronym SRK. He married Gauri Chibber, a Punjabi Hindu, in a traditional Hindu wedding ceremony on 25 October 1991, after a six-year courtship. They have a son Aryan (born 1997) and a daughter Suhana (born 2000). In 2013, they became parents of a third child named AbRam, who was born through a surrogate mother. According to Khan, while he strongly believes in Islam, he also values his wife's religion. His children follow both religions; at home the Qur'an is situated next to the Hindu deities. Khan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead. In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai. This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series Circus (1989\u201390) and Mani Kaul's miniseries Idiot (1991). Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988\u201390), and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989). His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar, but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough. Khan changed his decision to act in films in April 1991, citing it as a way to escape the grief of his mother's death. He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career in Bollywood, and was quickly signed to four films. His first offer was for Hema Malini's directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai, and by June, he had started his first shoot. His film debut was in Deewana, which was released in June 1992. In it he starred alongside Divya Bharti as the second male lead behind Rishi Kapoor. Deewana became a box office hit and launched Khan's Bollywood career; he earned the Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance. Also released in 1992 were Khan's first films as the male lead, Chamatkar, Dil Aashna Hai, and the comedy Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, which was his first of many collaborations with the actress Juhi Chawla. His initial film roles saw him play characters who displayed energy and enthusiasm. According to Arnab Ray of Daily News and Analysis, Khan brought a new kind of acting as he was \"sliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energy\u00a0... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next.\" Among his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: an obsessive lover in Darr, and a murderer in Baazigar. Darr marked the first of Khan's many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan's stammering and the use of the phrase \"I love you, K-k-k-Kiran\" were popular with audiences. For Darr he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for Sir. Baazigar, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula. In The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character \"the consummate anti-hero\". His performance in Baazigar, which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 2003, the Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema stated that Khan \"defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero\". Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with Deepa Sahi in Maya Memsaab, although parts of it were censored by the Central Board of Film Certification. The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles. In 1994, Khan played a love-struck musician in Kundan Shah's comedy-drama film Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa opposite Deepak Tijori and Suchitra Krishnamurthy, which he later professed was his favourite role. His performance earned him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance, and in a retrospective review from 2004, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com referred to it as Khan's best performance, saying \"He is spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and acting straight from the heart.\" Also in 1994, Khan won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his role as an obsessive lover in Anjaam, co-starring Madhuri Dixit and Deepak Tijori. At the time, playing antagonistic roles was considered risky to a leading man's career in Bollywood. Ray subsequently credited Khan for taking \"insane risks\" and \"pushing the envelope\" by choosing to play such characters, through which he established his career in Bollywood. The director Mukul S. Anand called him \"the new face of the industry\" at the time. Khan starred in seven films in 1995, the first of which was Rakesh Roshan's melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun. Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. His most significant release that year was Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, in which he played a young Non-resident Indian (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol's character during a trip across Europe. Khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited with establishing him as a \"romantic hero\". Lauded by both critics and the public, it became the year's highest grossing production in India and abroad and was declared an \"all time blockbuster\" by Box Office India, with a gross of over \u20b91.22 billion (US$19\u00a0million) worldwide. It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema; it is still showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early 2015. The film won ten Filmfare Awards, including the second of Khan's Best Actor Awards. The director and critic Raja Sen said, \"Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. He's cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the [audience]. The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting.\" In 1996, all four of Khan's releases failed critically and commercially, but the following year, his starring role opposite Aditya Pancholi and Juhi Chawla in Aziz Mirza's romantic comedy Yes Boss earned him accolades that included a Filmfare Best Actor nomination. Later in 1997, he starred in Subhash Ghai's diasporic-themed social drama Pardes, portraying Arjun, a musician facing a moral dilemma. India Today cites it as one of the first major Bollywood pictures to succeed in the United States. Khan's final release of 1997 was a second collaboration with Yash Chopra in the popular musical romance Dil To Pagal Hai. He portrayed Rahul, a stage director caught in a love triangle between Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor. The film and his performance met with critical praise, winning Khan his third Best Actor Award at Filmfare. Khan performed the lead role in three films and made one special appearance in 1998. In his first release of the year, he played a double role opposite Juhi Chawla and Sonali Bendre in Mahesh Bhatt's action comedy Duplicate, the first of his many collaborations with Yash Johar's production company Dharma Productions. The film was not well received, but India Today lauded Khan for his energetic performance. The same year, Khan won critical praise for his performance as an All India Radio correspondent who develops an infatuation for a mysterious terrorist (Manisha Koirala) in Dil Se.., the third instalment of Mani Ratnam's trilogy of terror films. In his final release of the year, he portrayed a college student in Karan Johar's romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, in which he was involved in a love triangle along with Kajol and Rani Mukerji. The writer Anjana Motihar Chandra has referred to the picture as the blockbuster of the 1990s, a \"pot-pourri of romance, comedy, and entertainment.\" Khan won the Best Actor award at the Filmfare Awards ceremony for the second consecutive year, although he and several critics believed his performance to have been overshadowed by that of Kajol. The roles in this phase of his career, and the series of romantic comedies and family dramas that followed, earned Khan widespread adulation from audiences, particularly teenagers, and according to author Anupama Chopra, established him as an icon of romance in India. He continued to have frequent professional associations with Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra, and Karan Johar, who moulded his image and made him into a superstar. Khan became a romantic leading man without ever actually kissing any of his co-stars, although he broke this rule in 2012, after strong urging by Yash Chopra. Khan's only release in 1999 was Baadshah, in which he starred opposite Twinkle Khanna. Although the film underperformed at the box office, it earned him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Performance in a Comic Role, which he lost to Govinda for Haseena Maan Jaayegi. Khan became a producer in 1999 in a collaboration with the actress Juhi Chawla and the director Aziz Mirza for a production company called Dreamz Unlimited. The company's first production, Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000), starring Khan and Chawla, was a commercial failure. It was released one week after Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, starring Hrithik Roshan, then a newcomer, who critics believed overshadowed Khan. Swapna Mitter of Rediff.com spoke of Khan's predictable mannerisms, saying \"Frankly, it's high time he innovated his act a little.\" Khan did a supporting role in Kamal Hassan's Hey Ram (2000), which was made simultaneously in Tamil and Hindi. He thereby made his Tamil debut by playing the role of an archaeologist named Amjad Khan. He performed free of charge as he wanted to work with Kamal Haasan. On Khan's performance, T. Krithika Reddy of The Hindu wrote, \"Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance.\" In 2001, Dreamz Unlimited attempted a comeback with Khan portraying the title role in Santosh Sivan's historical epic A\u015boka, a partly fictionalised account of the life of emperor Ashoka. The film was screened at the Venice Film Festival and the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival to a positive response, but it performed poorly at Indian box offices. As losses continued to mount for the production company, Khan was forced to close srkworld.com, a company that he had started along with Dreamz Unlimited. In December 2001, Khan suffered a spinal injury while performing an action sequence for a special appearance in Krishna Vamsi's Shakti: The Power. He was subsequently diagnosed with a prolapsed disc, and attempted multiple alternative therapies. None of these provided a permanent solution to the injury, which caused him severe pain while shooting several of his films. By the beginning of 2003, his condition had worsened to the point that he had to undergo anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery at Wellington Hospital, London. Khan resumed shooting in June 2003, but he reduced his workload and the number of film roles he accepted annually. Successes during this time included Aditya Chopra's Mohabbatein (2000), and Karan Johar's family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), which Khan cites as a turning point in his career. Both films co-starred Amitabh Bachchan as an authoritarian figure, and presented ideological struggles between the two men. Khan's performances in the films were met with wide public appreciation, and he was awarded his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for Mohabbatein. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... remained the top-grossing Indian production of all time in the overseas market for the next five years. In 2002, Khan played the title role as a rebellious alcoholic opposite Aishwarya Rai in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period romance Devdas. At a cost of over \u20b9500 million (US$7.7\u00a0million), it was the most expensive Bollywood film ever made at the time, yet recovered its costs, earning \u20b9840 million (US$13\u00a0million) worldwide. The film earned numerous accolades including 10 Filmfare Awards, with Best Actor for Khan, and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. Khan next starred in Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), a comedy-drama written by Karan Johar and set in New York City, which became the second-highest-grossing film domestically and the top-grossing Bollywood film in external markets that year. Co-starring with Jaya Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta, Khan received critical praise for his portrayal of Aman Mathur, a man with a fatal heart disease, with critics praising his emotional impact upon audiences. Conflict broke out between Khan and the other partners of Dreamz Unlimited over the failure to cast Juhi Chawla in their 2003 production of Aziz Mirza's Chalte Chalte, and they parted ways, despite the film's success. 2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for Khan. He transformed Dreamz Unlimited into Red Chillies Entertainment, adding his wife Gauri as a producer. In the company's first production, he starred in Farah Khan's directorial debut, the action comedy masala film Main Hoon Na. A fictionalised account of India\u2013Pakistan relations, it was viewed by some commentators as a conscious effort to move away from the stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan as the constant villain. Khan then played an Indian Air Force pilot who falls in love with a Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta) in Yash Chopra's romance film Veer-Zaara, which was screened at the 55th Berlin Film Festival to critical praise. It was the highest earning film of 2004 in India, with a worldwide gross of over \u20b9940 million (US$15\u00a0million), and Main Hoon Na was the second-highest earner with \u20b9680 million (US$11\u00a0million). In his final release of 2004, Khan starred as a NASA scientist who patriotically returns to India to rekindle his roots in Ashutosh Gowariker's social drama Swades (meaning \"Homeland\"), which became the first Indian picture to be shot inside the NASA research centre at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Film scholar Stephen Teo refers to the picture as an example of \"Bollywoodised realism\", displaying a transcendence in conventional narrative and audience expectation in Hindi cinema. In December 2013, The Times of India reported that Khan found filming the picture such an emotionally overwhelming and life-changing experience that he had still not viewed the film. Derek Elley of Variety found Khan's performance \"unsettling\" as \"a self-satisfied expatriate determined to bring Western values to poor Indian peasants\", but several film critics, including Jitesh Pillai, believed it to have been his finest acting to date. He was nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for all three of his 2004 releases and eventually won the award for Swades. Filmfare later included his performance in the 2010 issue of Bollywood's \"Top 80 Iconic Performances\". In 2005, Khan starred in Amol Palekar's fantasy drama, Paheli. The film was India's submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards. He later collaborated with Karan Johar for the third time in the musical romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), the story of two unhappily married people in New York City who begin an extramarital affair. The film, which featured an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Preity Zinta, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji and Kirron Kher, emerged as India's highest-grossing film in the overseas market, earning more than \u20b91.13 billion (US$17\u00a0million) worldwide. Both his roles in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and the action film Don, a remake of the 1978 film of the same name, earned Khan Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare Awards, despite his performance as the titular character in Don being negatively compared to that of Amitabh Bachchan in the original film. \"Such great things have happened to such a normal guy like me. I am a nobody who shouldn't have been able to do all this but I have done it. I tell everyone that there's this myth I work for; there is this myth called Shahrukh Khan and I am his employee. I have to live up to that\u00a0... I'll do it, I am an actor. But I can't start believing in this myth.\" In 2007, Khan portrayed a disgraced hockey player who coaches the Indian women's national hockey team to World Cup success in Yash Raj Films' semi-fictional Chak De! India. Bhaichand Patel notes that Khan, who had a background in the sport playing for his university's hockey team, essentially portrayed himself as a \"cosmopolitan, liberal, Indian Muslim\". Faring well in both India and abroad, Khan garnered another Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance, which Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN considers to have been \"without any of his typical trappings, without any of his trademark quirks\", portraying Kabir Khan \"like a real flesh-and-blood human being\". Filmfare included his performance in their 2010 issue of the \"Top 80 Iconic Performances\". In the same year, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal, Deepika Padukone and Shreyas Talpade in Farah Khan's reincarnation melodrama Om Shanti Om, portraying a 1970s junior artiste who is reborn as a 2000s era superstar. The film became the highest grossing Indian motion picture of 2007, both domestically and abroad. Om Shanti Om earned Khan his second nomination of the year for Best Actor at Filmfare. Khalid Mohammed from Hindustan Times wrote, \"the enterprise belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, who tackles comedy, high drama and action with his signature style\u2014spontaneous and intuitively intelligent\". Khan collaborated for the third time with Aditya Chopra on the romantic drama Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) opposite Anushka Sharma, at that time a newcomer. He played Surinder Sahni, a shy man with low self-esteem, whose love for his young arranged wife (Sharma) causes him to transform himself into Raj, a boisterous alter-ego. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times believed the dual role to have been \"tailor-made\" for Khan, giving him the opportunity to display his talents, although Deep Contractor from Epilogue thought Khan displayed greater strength in the role of Surinder and weakness in the role of monologue-prone Raj. In December 2008, Khan suffered a shoulder injury while filming a small role in Mudassar Aziz's Dulha Mil Gaya. He underwent extensive physiotherapy sessions at the time but the pain left him almost immobile and he had arthroscopic surgery in February 2009. He performed an extended, special appearance in the 2009 film Billu, playing Bollywood superstar Sahir Khan\u2014a fictionalised version of himself, wherein he performed musical item numbers with actresses Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, and Deepika Padukone. As head of the film's production company, Red Chillies, Khan made the call to change the title of the film from Billu Barber to Billu after hairdressers across the country complained that the word \"barber\" was derogatory. The company covered up the offending word on billboards that had already been installed with the original title. After refusing the role that subsequently went to Anil Kapoor in Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Khan began shooting My Name Is Khan (2010), his fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar and his sixth with Kajol. The film is based on a true story and set against the backdrop of perceptions of Islam after the 11 September attacks. Khan plays Rizwan Khan, a Muslim suffering from mild Asperger syndrome who sets out on a journey across America to meet the country's president, in a role that film scholar Stephen Teo sees as a \"symbol of assertive rasa values\" and another example of Khan representing NRI identity in global Bollywood. To provide an accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, Khan spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected by the condition. Upon release, My Name is Khan became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time outside India, and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor, equalling the record for the most wins in the category with actor Dilip Kumar. Jay Wesissberg from Variety noted how Khan portrayed the Asperger's sufferer with \"averted eyes, springy steps, [and] stuttered repetitions of memorized texts\", believing it to have been a \"standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society's gold seal of approval\". In 2011, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal and Kareena Kapoor in Anubhav Sinha's science fiction superhero film Ra.One, his first work in this genre, as a favour to his children. The film follows the story of a London-based videogame designer who creates a villainous character who escapes into the real world. It was billed as Bollywood's most expensive production; it had an estimated budget of \u20b91.25 billion (US$19\u00a0million). Despite negative media coverage of the film's box office performance, Ra.One was a financial success with a gross of \u20b92.4 billion (US$37\u00a0million). The film, and Khan's portrayal of a dual role, received mixed reviews; while most critics praised his performance as the robotic superhero G.One, they criticised his portrayal of the videogame designer Shekhar. Khan's second release of 2011 was Don 2, a sequel to Don (2006). To prepare for his role, Khan exercised extensively and performed most of the stunts himself. His performance earned him positive reviews from critics; Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India said, \"Shah Rukh remains in command and never loses his foothold, neither through the dramatic sequences nor through the action cuts\". The year's highest grossing Bollywood production abroad, it was showcased at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival. Khan's only release in 2012 was Yash Chopra's last picture, the drama Jab Tak Hai Jaan, which saw him once again in a romantic role, starring opposite Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma. CNN-IBN considered the overall performance by Khan to have been one of his finest to date, but believed that Khan's first screen kiss of his career with Katrina Kaif, twenty years his junior, was an awkward one. Jab Tak Hai Jaan was a moderate financial success earning over \u20b92.11 billion (US$33\u00a0million) worldwide. The film was showcased at the 2012 Marrakech International Film Festival in Morocco, along with Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., Veer-Zaara, and Don 2. At the following Zee Cine Awards, Khan performed a tribute to the late Yash Chopra along with Kaif, Sharma, and several of Chopra's other past heroines. In 2013, Khan starred in Rohit Shetty's action comedy Chennai Express for Red Chillies Entertainment, a film which earned mixed critical reviews and a fair amount of criticism for its perceived disparagement of South Indian culture, although the film included a tribute to Tamil cinema star Rajinikanth. The critic Khalid Mohamed thought that Khan overacted in the film and criticised him for \"re-rendering every old trick in the acting book\". Despite the criticism, the film broke many box office records for Hindi films in both India and abroad, surpassing 3 Idiots to briefly become the highest grossing Bollywood film of all time, with a gross of almost \u20b94 billion (US$62\u00a0million) in worldwide ticket sales. On 7 March 2013\u2014a day before International Women's Day\u2014The Times of India reported that Khan had requested a new convention with the name of his lead female co-stars appearing above his own in the credits. He claimed that the women in his life, including his co-stars, have been the reason for his success. In 2014, the actor was featured in Farah Khan's ensemble comedy Happy New Year, which co-starred Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan and Boman Irani; his third collaboration with the director. Although Khan's unidimensional character was criticised, the film became a major commercial success grossing \u20b93.8 billion (US$59\u00a0million) worldwide. Khan next appeared alongside Kajol, Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon in Rohit Shetty's comedy-drama Dilwale (2015). The film garnered negative reviews, though was financially profitable with a gross of \u20b93.9 billion (US$60\u00a0million). Namrata Joshi of The Hindu commented, \"With Dilwale, Rohit Shetty goes hopelessly wrong despite much that he had at his disposal, including a power-packed cast and producer\". Joshi also felt that the attempt to repackage Khan and Kajol had backfired. He then took on dual parts of a superstar and his doppelg\u00e4nger fan in Maneesh Sharma's thriller Fan (2016). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian considered the film to be \"exhausting, bizarre yet watchable\" and thought that Khan was aptly \"creepy\" as the obsessive admirer. The film underperformed at the box office, and trade journalists attributed this failure to the film's non-conformity to mainstream formula. Later that year, Khan portrayed the supporting part of a therapist to an aspiring cinematographer (played by Alia Bhatt) in Gauri Shinde's coming-of-age film Dear Zindagi. In Rahul Dholakia's crime-drama film Raees (2017), Khan took on the part of the titular anti-hero\u2014a bootlegger turned mobster in 1980s Gujarat. In a typical mixed review, Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph thought Khan's performance to be \"inconsistent, intense and power-packed at times, but often slipping out of character into his usual mix of stock mannerisms\". Commercially, the film was a modest success, earning over \u20b92.6 billion (US$40\u00a0million) worldwide. As of February 2017, Khan is filming for Imtiaz Ali's untitled project opposite Anushka Sharma, and has committed to star in Aanand L Rai's next project. Khan co-produced three films from 1999 to 2003 as a founding member of the partnership Dreamz Unlimited. After the partnership was dissolved, he and Gauri restructured the company as Red Chillies Entertainment, which includes divisions dealing with film and television production, visual effects, and advertising. As of 2015, the company has produced or co-produced at least nine films. Either Khan or Guari are usually given production credits, and he has appeared in most of the films, either in the lead role, or in a guest appearance. Khan was involved in several aspects of the making of Ra.One (2011). Aside from acting, he produced the film, volunteered to write the console game script, dubbed for it, oversaw its technical development, and wrote the digital comics based on the film's characters. Khan has occasionally done playback singing for his films. In Josh (2000) he sang the popular song \"Apun Bola Tu Meri Laila\". He also sang in Don (2006) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012). For Always Kabhi Kabhi (2011), which was produced by Red Chillies, Khan participated in the lyrical composition. In addition to his early television serial appearances, Khan has hosted numerous televised awards shows, including the Filmfare, Zee Cine, and Screen Awards. In 2007, he replaced Amitabh Bachchan for one season as the host of Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, and a year later, Khan began hosting Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain?, the Indian version of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?. In 2011, he returned to television, appearing on Imagine TV's Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout, the Indian version of Wipeout; scenes featuring Khan were shot at the Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai. Contrary to his earlier television anchoring jobs, Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout performed poorly. It aired for only one season and became the lowest rated show hosted by a Bollywood star. Khan is a frequent stage performer and has participated in several world tours and concerts. In 1997, he performed in Asha Bhosle's Moments in Time concert in Malaysia, and returned the following year to perform with Karisma Kapoor for the Shahrukh\u2013Karisma: Live in Malaysia concert. The same year, he participated in The Awesome Foursome world tour across the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States along with Juhi Chawla, Akshay Kumar and Kajol, and resumed the tour in Malaysia the following year. In 2002, Khan featured with Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Preity Zinta, and Aishwarya Rai in the show From India With Love at Manchester's Old Trafford and London's Hyde Park; the event was attended by more than 100,000\u00a0people. Khan performed alongside Rani Mukherji, Arjun Rampal and Ishaa Koppikar in a 2010 concert at the Army Stadium in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The next year he joined Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra in the Friendship Concert, celebrating 150\u00a0years of India\u2013South Africa friendship in Durban, South Africa. Khan started an association with the \"Temptations\" series of concert tours by singing, dancing, and performing skits alongside Arjun Rampal, Priyanka Chopra, and other Bollywood stars in Temptations 2004, a stage show that toured 22\u00a0venues across the world. The show played to 15,000\u00a0spectators at Dubai's Festival City Arena. In 2008, Khan set up Temptation Reloaded, a series of concerts that toured several countries, including the Netherlands. Another tour was held with Bipasha Basu and others in 2012 in Jakarta, and in 2013 another series of concerts visited Auckland, Perth and Sydney. In 2014, Khan performed in SLAM! The Tour in the US, Canada, and London, and also hosted the Indian premiere of the live talent show, Got Talent World Stage Live. In 2008, Khan, in partnership with Juhi Chawla and her husband Jay Mehta, acquired ownership rights for the franchise representing Kolkata in the Twenty20 cricket tournament Indian Premier League (IPL) for US$75.09 million, and named the team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). As of 2009[update], KKR was one of the richest teams in the IPL, with a brand value of US$42.1 million. The team performed poorly on the field during the first three years. Their performance improved over time, and they became the champions in 2012 and 2014. Khan performed alongside Sunidhi Chauhan and Shriya Saran at the opening ceremony of the 2011 season, where they danced to Tamil songs. He appeared again in 2013 alongside Katrina Kaif, Deepika Padukone and Pitbull. In May 2012, the Mumbai Cricket Association banned him from the Wankhede Stadium for five years for arguing with security guards and officials after a match between KKR and The Mumbai Indians. Khan later apologised to his fans after his team won the final match. Shah Rukh Khan receives a considerable amount of media coverage in India, and is often referred to as \"King Khan\", \"The Baadshah of Bollywood\", or \"The King of Bollywood\". Anupama Chopra cites him as an \"ever present celebrity\", with two or three films a year, constantly running television ads, print ads and gigantic billboards lining the streets of Indian cities. He is the object of a sometimes fanatical following, with a fan base estimated to exceed one billion. In 2011 he was declared \"the biggest movie star you've never heard of...perhaps the world's biggest movie star, period\" by Steven Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times[d] and has been called the world's biggest movie star in other international media outlets.

Khan has endorsed brands including Pepsi, Nokia, Hyundai, Dish TV, D'decor, LUX and TAG Heuer. Books have been published about him, and his popularity has been documented in several non-fiction films, including the two-part documentary The Inner and Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan (2005), and the Discovery Travel & Living channel's ten-part miniseries Living with a Superstar\u2014Shah Rukh Khan (2010). In 2007, Khan became the third Indian actor to have his wax statue installed at London's Madame Tussauds museum, after Aishwarya Rai and Amitabh Bachchan.

        "biography": " Shakti Kapoor (born as Sunil Sikanderlal Kapoor on 3 September 1952 ) is an Indian actor who appears in Bollywood films. Known for his villainous and comic roles in Hindi films, he has featured in more than 700 films throughout his career. In the 1980s and 1990s, Kapoor teamed up with actor Kader Khan as the comical or evil duo in over 100 films. He was a contestant in the Indian reality show Bigg Boss.   Shakti Kapoor was born in Delhi, India to a Punjabi family. His father ran a tailor shop in Connaught Place, New Delhi.After a long struggle, Shakti Kapoor was spotted by superstar Sunil Dutt whilst he was making 'Rocky' to launch his son Sanjay. He was then cast as the antagonist in the movie. But Sunil Dutt felt that his name 'Sunil Sikanderlal Kapoor' wouldn't do justice to his villainous stint and hence, 'Shakti Kapoor' was born. Shakti Kapoor's portrayal of RD earned him praises and made him a name to be sought out for. As a struggler in Bollywood, initially Shakti Kapoor did many small inconsequential roles in movies, all the while looking out for a suitable role as a leading man. The years 1980\u201381 established Shakti Kapoor as an actor in Bollywood with two of his movies Qurbani and Rocky. In 1983, Kapoor had roles in Himmatwala and the Subhash Ghai directed movie Hero. Kapoor had played villain roles in both these movies. In the nineties, he often diversified to positive comic roles and performed them with equal finesse.[citation needed] He has been nominated for the Filmfare Award in the Best Comedian category and won once, for his performance as Nandu in David Dhawan's film, Raja Babu. Some of his comic roles have been as Inspector Bhinde in Insaaf, Prasad in Baap Numbri Beta Dus Numbri, Crime Master Gogo in Andaz Apna Apna, Tohfa, as Batuknath in ChaalBaaz and as Goonga in Bol Radha Bol.

This incident sparked a controversy in Bollywood and Kapoor was banned by the Film & Television Producers Guild of India. Association of Indian Motion Pictures and TV Programme Producers decided not to ban him as no allegations against him were proven. One week later, however, the Film & Television Producers Guild lifted the ban. Kapoor claimed that the video clip in question was doctored and he had been framed.

        "biography": " Shammi Kapoor (born Shamsher Raj Kapoor; 21 October 1931 \u2013 14 August 2011) was an Indian film actor and director. He was a prominent lead actor in Hindi cinema from the late 1950s until the early 1970s and also made a debut in Tamil cinema with the 1992 blockbuster crime drama Amaran. He received the Filmfare Best Actor Award in 1968 for his performance in Brahmachari and Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor for Vidhaata in 1982. Shammi Kapoor is hailed as one of the most entertaining lead actors that Hindi cinema has ever produced. He was one of the leading stars of Hindi cinema during the late 1950s, the 1960s and early 1970s. He made his Hindi Film debut in 1953 with the film Jeevan Jyoti, and went on to deliver hits like Tumsa Nahin Dekha, Dil Deke Dekho, Singapore, Junglee, College Girl, Professor, China Town, Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya, Kashmir Ki Kali, Janwar, Teesri Manzil, An Evening in Paris, Bramhachari, Andaz and Sachaai.

Shammi was the second of the three sons born to Prithviraj (the other two being Raj Kapoor and Shashi Kapoor, both successful Hindi Film actors). He was the first cousin of singer, Juggal Kishore Mehra, whose daughter, actress-singer Salma Agha is his niece. Though born in Mumbai, he spent a major portion of his childhood in Peshawar in the Kapoor Haveli and in Calcutta (now Kolkata), where his father was involved with New Theatres Studios, acting in films. It was in Kolkata that he did his Montessory and Kindergarten. After coming back to Bombay, he first went to St. Joseph's Convent (Wadala) and then, to Don Bosco School. He finished his matric schooling from New Era School at Hughes Road. Kapoor had a short stint at Ramnarain Ruia College after which he joined his father\u2019s theatrical company Prithvi Theatres. He entered the cinema world in 1948, as a junior artiste, at a salary of Rs. 50 per month, stayed with Prithvi Theatres for the next four years and collected his last pay check of Rs. 300, in 1952. He made his debut in Hindi Films in the year 1953, when the film Jeevan Jyoti was released. It was directed by Mahesh Kaul and Chand Usmani was Kapoor\u2019s first heroine. He was in a relationship with Nadia Gamal, a belly dancer from Cairo and Egyptian actress, from 1953-55 after they met in Sri Lanka on an occasion while he was on a holiday trip, but their relationship ended when she moved back to Cairo. Kapoor started out with serious roles but with Filmistan's Nasir Hussain directed Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957) opposite Ameeta and Dil Deke Dekho (1959) with Asha Parekh, he attained the image of a light-hearted, and stylish playboy. With Junglee (1961) his new image was cemented and his subsequent films were all in this genre viz. Romcoms.Mohammed Rafi was frequently chosen as his playback voice in the movies that he did. In his early career in the 1950s, he acted with established actresses playing second fiddle in woman-oriented movies: with Madhubala in films such as Rail Ka Dibba (1953) and Naqab, with Nutan in Laila Majnu, with Shyama in Thokar and with Nalini Jaywant in Hum Sab Chor Hain. From 1953 to 1957, none of his films made him popular, until Tumsa Nahin Dekhain 1957.In the 1960s he was often paired with new actresses such as Asha Parekh, Saira Banu, and Sharmila Tagore, all of whom went on to have very successful careers. Of all his heroines, he said that Sharmila Tagore, Rajshree, and Asha Parekh were easy to work with. Sharmila Tagore and Saira Banu made their Hindi film debuts with Shammi Kapoor in Kashmir Ki Kali and Junglee respectively He and Asha Parekh were paired in four films, of which the murder mystery Teesri Manzil (1966) and Dil Deke Dekho were successful.

He gained more widespread popularity with the successful films Tumsa Nahi Dekha (1957), Ujala and Dil Dil Deke Deko (both 1959). In the first half of the 1960s, Kapoor was seen in successful films like College Girl, Basant, Singapore, Boy Friend, Professor, Dil Tera Diwana, Vallah Kya Baat Hai, Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya, China Town, Kashmir Ki Kali, Bluff Master, Janwar and Rajkumar. In 1968, he received the first Filmfare Best Actor Award of his career for Bramhachari. He made a unique place for himself in the industry as he was the only dancing hero in Hindi films from the late 1950s till the early 1970s.[citation needed] He used to compose dancing steps in the songs starring him and reportedly never needed a choreographer. This earned him the name of Elvis Presley of India. His pairing opposite Southern heroines tended to be commercially successful. He played opposite B. Saroja Devi in Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya and Preet Na Jane Reet, with Padmini in Singapore, and opposite Vyjayanthimala in College Girl and Prince. In the late 1960s, his successful films included Budtameez and Sachaai with Sadhana, Latt Saheb with Nutan and Tumse Achha Kaun Hai with Babita. In the 1970s, Kapoor\u2019s weight problem proved an obstacle when playing the romantic hero, and the last such film he played in was Andaz (1971). He would move to character roles and acted in films like Zameer, Hero, Vidhaata, Hukumat, Batwara, Tahalka, Chamatkar, Namak and Prem Granth. In 1974, he directed Manoranjan and in 1976 Bundal Baaz. Shammi turned into a successful supporting actor in the 1970s, playing Saira Banu's father in Zameer (1974), when he had been her leading man a decade earlier in Junglee (1961) and Bluff Master (1964) and playing Amitabh Bachchan's foster father in Parvarish. He also directed Manoranjan (1974), a movie inspired from Irma La Douce and in which he played a supporting role and Bundal Baaz (1976) starring Rajesh Khanna. Neither were successful commercially though they got critical acclaim and were hailed as classics and ahead of their time. In the 1980s and 1990s, he continued to play many supporting roles and won a Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award for his performance in Vidhaata (1982). He got the opportunity to do some films in other languages such as Bengali and Tamil in the nineties. He did a social melodrama serial called Chattan aired on Zee TV for more than a year in the 1990s.

Tera Kya Kehna and the delayed 2006 release Sandwich (his last appearance as a character actor). He made his last appearance in Imtiaz Ali's directorial venture Rockstar co-starring his grand-nephew Ranbir Kapoor, the grandson of his brother Raj Kapoor. Director Shakti Samanta directed Shammi Kapoor in six films \u2014 Singapore, China Town, Kashmir Ki Kali, An Evening In Paris, Pagla Kahin Ka and Jaane Anjane (the last two were unsuccessful) \u2014 and said in an interview \u201cI found Shammi to be a thoroughly good man. Even in his heydays, he was humble.\" Kapoor met Geeta Bali in 1955, during the shooting of the film Rangeen Raaten, where he was the leading actor and she played a cameo. Four months later, they married at Banganga Temples, near Napean Sea Road of Mumbai. They had a son, Aditya Raj Kapoor, on 1 July 1956, at Shirodkar's Hospital, Mumbai, a year after they were married. Five years later, in 1961, they had a daughter, Kanchan. Geeta Bali died from smallpox in 1965. Shammi Kapoor married Neila Devi, from the former royal family of Bhavnagar in Gujarat, on January 27, 1969. In an interview in 2011, Mumtaz had stated that Shammi Kapoor had proposed marriage to her, as they had drawn close while shooting for Brahmachari. This was post the death of his first wife Geeta Bali. Mumtaz states that she had politely refused, as Shammi Kapoor wanted her to give up her career. Bina Ramani, an eminent socialite also claims to have had a tumultuous affair with Shammi Kapoor at around the same time as Mumtaz.

        "biography": " Sharmila Tagore (also known as Begum Ayesha Sultana; born 8 December 1944) is an Indian film actress known for her works predominantly in Hindi cinema. She has received two National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards for her performances. She led the Indian Film Censor Board from October 2004 till March 2011. In December 2005 she was chosen as an UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. She was one of the International Competition's Jury Members at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. In 2013, she was awarded Padma Bhushan by the Government of India.   Sharmila Tagore was born in Hyderabad, India, the daughter of Gitindranath Tagore, a general manager in the British India Corporation, by his wife Ira Tagore (n\u00e9e Barua). While Tagore's father belonged to a Bengali family, her mother came from an Assamese family, and both of them were distantly related to the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Gitindranath was the grandson of the noted painter Gaganendranath Tagore, whose own grandfather Girindranath had been a first cousin of the laureate. In fact, Sharmila Tagore is more closely related to Rabindranath Tagore through her mother: her maternal grandmother Latika Barua (n\u00e9e Tagore) was the granddaughter of Rabindranath Tagore's brother Dwijendranath Tagore. Tagore's maternal grandfather (husband of Latika Barua n\u00e9e Tagore) was Jnanadabhiram Barua, the first Principal of Earl Law College in Guwahati (now known as Government Law College), himself the son of the noted social worker Gunabhiram Barua. As a member of the Tagore family, Sharmila Tagore is also a distant relative of the actress Devika Rani and the painter Abanindranath Tagore (brother of Gaganendranath Tagore) Tagore was the eldest of three children and had two younger sisters, the late Oindrila Kunda [Tinku Tagore] and Romila Sen [Chinky]. Oindrila was the first in the family to act in a film, and the only role she ever played was that of Mini, the child character (but a central character) in Tapan Sinha's film Kabuliwala (1957). In adulthood, she became an international bridge player. The other sister, Romila Sen, is the wife of Nikhil Sen, a corporate honcho who served as Chief Operating Officer of Britannia Industries for many years. Tagore attended St. John's Diocesan Girls' Higher Secondary School and Loreto Convent, Asansol. She made her film debut when she was a 13-year-old schoolgirl, after which her studies lost priority, and she never finished school. Within a short while, her results in school became very bad, her attendance levels were very low, she came to be regarded as a bad influence on her classmates, and was faced with a choice of either doing films or studying further. At that point, her father advised her to move ahead in life, commit herself to a film career and 'give it her all' in order to become successful. She did as her father advised, and credits her parents for having supported her at every point in her life. Tagore began her career as an actress in Satyajit Ray's 1959 Bengali film Apur Sansar (The World of Apu), as the ill-fated bride of the title character. She later appeared in Shakti Samanta's Kashmir Ki Kali in 1964. Samanta cast her in many more films, including An Evening in Paris (1967), in which she became the first Indian actress to appear in a bikini, which established Tagore as somewhat of a sex symbol in Hindi films. She also posed in a bikini for the glossy Filmfare magazine in 1968. But, when Tagore was the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification, she expressed concerns about the increased use of bikinis in Indian films. Samanta later teamed up Tagore with Rajesh Khanna for movies such as Aradhana (1969) and Amar Prem (1972). Other directors paired them together in Safar (1970), Daag (1973), and Maalik (1972). The pair of Khanna-Sharmila gave 7 box office hits \u2013 Aradhana, Safar, Amar Prem, Chhoti Bahu, Daag , \"Raja Rani\" and Avishkaar. As per the review of the film Raja Rani (1973 film) made in 2014 by the Hindu newspaper, the film did well at the box office and taking into consideration, the inflation as of 2014, the film would have grossed more than 100 crores. She starred in Gulzar's 1975 film, Mausam and won the National Film Award for Best Actress. She also played a supporting role in Mira Nair's 1991 film Mississippi Masala. She was the highest paid Bollywood actress from 1970 to 1976 along with Mumtaz. She starred opposite Dharmendra in Devar (1966), Anupama (1966), Mere Hamdam Mere Dost (1968), Satyakam (1969), Yakeen (1969), Chupke Chupke (1975) and Ek Mahal Ho Sapno Ka (1975); Amitabh Bachchan in Faraar (1975); Sanjeev Kumar in Mausam (1975), and Besharam (1978); and Naseeruddin Shah in the Bengali film Mangaldeep (1991). She married Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, the Nawab of Pataudi and former captain of the Indian cricket team, in a Nikah ceremony held on 27 December 1969. She converted to Islam and took on the name Ayesha Sultana. They had three children: Saif Ali Khan (b. 1970), a Bollywood actor, Saba Ali Khan (b. 1976), a jewellery designer, and Soha Ali Khan (b. 1978), a Bollywood actress and TV personality. Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi died, at age 70, on 22 September 2011. In November 2012 she wrote to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) asking for the upcoming series between India and England to be recognised as the Pataudi Trophy which was commissioned by the MCC in 2007. The Indian board responded saying that England's Test series in India are contested for the Anthony de Mello Trophy, in honour of the cricket administrator and co-founder of the BCCI. She visited Pakistan in February, 2016 and attended the Lahore Literature Festival. She also met Prime Minister of Pakistan Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif during her visit. Bengali"

        "artist_name": "Shilpa_Shetty", 
        "biography": " Shilpa Shetty (born 8 June 1975), also known by her married name Shilpa Shetty Kundra, is an Indian film actress, businesswoman, producer, former model and the winner of the British reality television series Celebrity Big Brother 5. Primarily known for her work in Hindi films, she has also appeared in Telugu, Tamil and Kannada language films. One of India's most popular and high-profile celebrities, Shetty is the recipient of numerous accolades, including four Filmfare Award nominations. As a teenager, Shetty did a few modelling assignments and appeared in several television commercials. She later made her acting debut in the 1993 thriller Baazigar that earned her nominations for the Filmfare Awards for Best Supporting Actress and Lux New Face of the Year. She subsequently earned wide recognition with dual roles in the 1994 action comedy Main Khiladi Tu Anari. After this initial success in her career, Shetty's films fared poorly at the box office for the next five years and garnered her negative reviews. The 2000 box office hit Dhadkan marked a turning point in her career, earning her praise and Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies. Shetty rose to prominence by featuring as the female lead in three of India's annually top-grossing productions\u2014the 2004 cop drama Garv, the 2005 Kannada film Auto Shankar and the 2007 family drama Apne\u2014and received praise for her performances in the dramas Pardesi Babu (1998), Rishtey (2002) and Life in a... Metro (2007). Her acclaimed portrayal of an AIDS patient in the 2004 drama Phir Milenge garnered her several accolades, including a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Shetty became a global figure after winning the 2007 British reality television series Celebrity Big Brother 5, with 63% of the final vote, following an international racism controversy. In addition to acting in films, Shetty is a prominent celebrity endorser for brands and products, and is vocal about the issues such as feminism and animal rights. She has featured as a celebrity host for the 2008 reality show Bigg Boss 2, and has served as a talent judge for the reality shows Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa and Nach Baliye. Since February 2009, Shetty is the co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Rajasthan Royals. She turned into a film producer with the 2014 action film Dishkiyaaoon. Following a high-profile relationship with actor Akshay Kumar, Shetty married businessman Raj Kundra in 2009, with whom she has a son. She was the judge of a TV dance reality show Super Dancer on Sohan Shetty Entertainment channel.   Shilpa Shetty was born to Tuluva community on 8 June 1975 in Mangalore. Her father, Surendra and her mother, Sunanda are both manufacturers of tamper-proof water caps for the pharmaceutical industry. Sunanda produced one of Shilpa's films, the Indo-Chinese drama The Desire, which went unreleased. Her younger sister, Shamita Shetty is also a Bollywood actress. They worked together once in the film Fareb (2005). In Mumbai, Shetty attended St. Anthony Girls' High School in Chembur, and later attended Podar College in Matunga. A trained Bharatanatyam dancer, she was also into sports and was the captain of the volleyball team in schools. She has a black belt in karate and is currently a dancesport expert and enthusiast. In 1991, after completing her tenth grade examinations, Shetty began her career as a model with a Limca television commercial, and subsequently featured in several other commercials and advertisements, following which she began receiving offers for film roles. Shetty continued to pursue her career as a model, until she became an actress. In September 1992, Shetty signed for and began working on her first film - the romantic drama Gaata Rahe Mera Dil - which tells the story of a girl involved in a love triangle between two men (played by Ronit Roy and Rohit Roy). However, the film went unreleased, which meant that Shetty's debut release was her next film, Abbas-Mustan's thriller Baazigar, alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol. Inspired from the Hollywood film A Kiss Before Dying, the film featured Shetty in the supporting role of Seema Chopra, a girl who is murdered by her revenge-seeking boyfriend, played by Khan. Baazigar proved to be a major box-office hit and finished up as the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year. Both the film as well as Shetty's performance received critical appreciation; Shetty eventually received Best Supporting Actress and Lux New Face of the Year (now known as Best Female Debut) nominations at the annual Filmfare Awards ceremony. In 1994, Shetty had three film releases. Her first release that year was the action drama Aag, in which she played her first leading role. Co-starring Govinda and Sonali Bendre, the film saw Shetty portray Bijli, a village belle who is actually a plainclothes policewoman assigned to arrest a murderer (played by Govinda) at any cost. Aag emerged as a moderate box-office success and fetched a mixed to positive critical reception, as did Shetty's performance. Shetty next starred alongside Akshay Kumar, Saif Ali Khan, Raageshwari and Shakti Kapoor in the action comedy Main Khiladi Tu Anari. In the film, Shetty played the dual roles of Mona (a cabaret dancer and a gangster's girlfriend) and her look-alike Basanti (a village belle). The film which marked Shetty's first of many collaborations with Kumar proved to be a super-hit at the box-office. Both the film as well as Shetty's performance received major critical acclaim; the success of Main Khiladi Tu Anari proved to be a breakthrough for Shetty. Her third and final release that year was the romantic drama Aao Pyaar Karen opposite Saif Ali Khan. The film which narrates the love story of a wealthy man and his maid (played by Khan and Shetty respectively) under-performed at the box-office. In 1995, Shetty starred in Hathkadi, where she was working alongside actors such as Saif Ali Khan, Govinda and Madhoo, but they failed at the box office. She made her Tamil film debut with the 1996 released Mr. Romeo alongside actors Prabhu Deva and Madhoo. The film was a sleeper musical hit at the box office. 1997 was one of her busiest years: she appeared in six different films, beginning with the Telugu language film Veedevadandi Babu. Her first major Bollywood film of that year was the action thriller Auzaar. Shilpa portrayed the character of Prathna Thakur alongside actors Salman Khan and Sanjay Kapoor. In 1998, she had one release, Pardesi Babu, for which she received critical acclaim and won the Bollywood Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 2000, Shetty received much acclaim for her role in Dhadkan which earned reasonable takings at the Indian box office. She received several nominations under the Best Actress category in award ceremonies. She would later go on to star with Anil Kapoor and Karisma Kapoor in the film Rishtey (2002). Her comic performance as an eccentric fisherwoman was appreciated and she received a nomination under the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award category and nominations for Best Comedian as well. 2004 was a good year for Shetty with the release of Garv in which she portrayed a Muslim orphan and disillusioned table dancer starring opposite Salman Khan. According to Shetty, she chose to do the film because she liked the subject. The film was a cop drama. She received much acclaim for her performance in Phir Milenge, where she made a sensitive portrayal of a successful city high-flyer who contracts HIV from unprotected sex and becomes a social outcast as a result. The film, based on 1993's Philadelphia, was perceived to have tackled a social taboo as yet unaddressed by Bollywood. The film earned Shetty a Filmfare Best Actress nomination, and provided an impetus for her HIV-related charity work (see below). Film critic Taran Adarsh from indiaFM noted, \"Phir Milenge belongs to Shilpa Shetty completely. She delivers, what can be rightly called, the performance of her career. The viewer feels and empathises with the character mainly because of her effective portrayal. She conveys the pain and the emotional upheaval through her expressive eyes, making it amongst the most memorable performances the year has seen so far.\" This marked a break from the previous trend of superficial song-and-dance items in favour of roles which have a greater depth of character, exemplified by her film Dus (2005), an action thriller. Although it received average returns at the box office, Shetty stated that she had taken the role to reinvent herself by portraying the rather unconventional character of an anti-terrorist squad member. In 2005, Shetty starred opposite Upendra in the Kannada film Auto Shankar. The film was a major box office success and it earned her the name \"The Gabbar Singh of the South\" due to her villainous role in the film. The same year, she starred with her sister in the film Fareb. Shilpa had one release in 2006, the much delayed Shaadi Karke Phas Gaya Yaar. The film was a box office flop, but she got good reviews for her role as a not entirely likeable wife. In 2006, she was a judge alongside Farah Khan & Sanjay Leela Bhansali on Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa, a Sony Entertainment Television dance show based on the original UK show Strictly Come Dancing. Shetty was once featured in Mani Ratnam's stage show, Netru, Indru, Naalai. 2007 proved to be Shetty's most successful year at the box office so far. Her first release, Life in a... Metro, won a significant reception and became the first Bollywood movie to premiere at Leicester Square. The film performed well at the box office and was declared a semi-hit within three weeks. Additionally, the film was critically acclaimed and Shetty's performance was appreciated, with Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN writing, \"It's a terrific performance and unquestionably Shilpa's best to date.\" Her second release, alongside three Deols ( Dharmendra, Sunny and Bobby), the drama Apne, was also a box office success. In February 2006, Shetty lent support to a BBC World Service Trust television show designed to tackle the problem of HIV-AIDS in India. According to reports, she participated in order to show solidarity with HIV-AIDS sufferers. Accrding to Shetty, the issue is particularly close to her heart as she had portrayed an HIV-positive sufferer in her 2004 film Phir Milenge. Speaking about the film and HIV in general, Shetty said: \"Why not a film on HIV positive patients? It is a social stigma in our society. We made this film to highlight this problem\u00a0... This film will bring about a social awareness about AIDS in our country. It is high time we talked about this in our society\". In March 2006 various sources reported Shetty's joining PETA as part of an advertising campaign against the use of wild animals in circuses. According to a PETA India press release, Shetty is a long-time PETA supporter and has assisted the campaign by posing for photographs in a figure-hugging tiger costume. She explained that her crouching in a cage was uncomfortable during the photoshoot, but that her discomfort was insignificant compared to the pain suffered by the creatures. \"These once dignified animals only leave their cages, which are barely larger than the size of their bodies, for a few minutes each day to be forced into the ring to perform tricks which make no sense and are upsetting to them. The best way to help animals suffering in circuses is to boycott the circus\". Shetty revealed in a later interview that she felt strongly about this cause and that she was appalled to hear of the cruel treatment suffered by such animals. \"I thought I should stop that. If I can make a little difference to their lives, why not go for it?\" In September 2006, alongside Farah Khan and Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Shetty began dating the first season of the dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa. In January 2007, Shetty was a contestant on and the subsequent winner of the British reality television series Celebrity Big Brother 5. She was the first Indian celebrity included in the show. Reportedly paid Rs.31.5\u00a0m (\u00a3367,500\u00a0GBP) for her participation, she said to presenter Davina McCall, \"I just want every Indian to be extremely proud that I'm in here\". As for her participation, she stated: \"I have zero expectations. The only thing I really hope to keep is my self-respect and my dignity.\" Her sister Shamita told The Times of India that this \"is the boldest decision Shilpa has taken so far.\" During her stay on the show, Shetty instructed fellow housemates Carole Malone and Ken Russell in meditation, and flirted with Dirk Benedict but tempers started to fray by Day 7 as a clique formed in the house disapproving of Shilpa's presence. Following a worldwide controversy that publicised her as a target of racist bullying within the house, Shetty won the contest after gaining 63% of the public vote and described the experience as \"incredible and overwhelming\". She further thanked the public for \"a fantastic opportunity to make my country proud\". In August 2008, Shetty began hosting the second season of the reality television series Bigg Boss, the Indian version of the international reality television series Big Brother. Controversially, one of the housemates was Jade Goody, Shetty's Celebrity Big Brother 5 co-contestant, with whom she was involved in the racism controversy. Goody left the series early after receiving news that she had cervical cancer, of which she later died on 22 March 2009. In February 2009, Shetty and Raj Kundra became part owners of the Indian Premier League franchise cricket team Rajasthan Royals by paying approximately US $15.4\u00a0million for an 11.7% stake. Alongside Sajid Khan and Terrence Lewis, Shetty featured as a talent judge for the dance reality show Nach Baliye (seasons 5, 6 and Shriman v/s Shrimati), from 2012 to 2014. In March 2014, Shetty began hosting the reality television show Soney Ka Dil, which she also co-produced along with Kundra. The show format is based on featuring ordinary people who have contributed their extraordinary help to others in need. The same year, Shetty turned into a film producer with the action film Dishkiyaaoon, a box-office flop. The film stars actors Aditya Pancholi, Sunny Deol and Harman Baweja. For the film's promotional activity, Shetty appeared as a guest on the Colors TV comedy show Comedy Nights With Kapil. Shetty also co-owns the Indian chain of spas and salon called Iosis. Shilpa launched her fitness Yoga DVD in 2015. From early 2016 to present day, she is judging a dance reality show Super Dancer on Sony Entertainment channel along with co-judges Geeta Kapoor and Anurag Basu. In April 2006, a Madurai court issued non-bailable warrants against Shetty and actress Reemma Sen for \"posing in an obscene manner\" in photographs published by a Tamil newspaper. The report stated that the two actresses had failed to comply with earlier summons for the same reason, hence the issuance of the warrants. The petitioner submitted that the paper had published \"very sexy and medium blow-ups\" in its December 2005 and January 2006 issues, and alleged that these violated the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act 1986, Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act 1956, and the Indian Penal Code Section 292 (Sale of Obscene Books). The petitioner further demanded that the images be confiscated under the terms of the Press and Registration of Book Act 1867. Shetty responded that she had not received any court summons and also discounted the charges. She further claimed that the pictures were freeze-frame shots from a recent movie that only exposed her navel. \"As far as my photographs go, what is obscene about it? If navel-showing is obscenity, then our traditional Indian outfit \u2013 the traditional sari \u2013 should be banned in the first place.\" In January 2007 outgoing Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal confirmed that Shetty had written to him requesting that he enunciate guidelines against frivolous lawsuits against the artists, but he had refused her plea on the grounds that she should have filed a formal petition instead of writing a letter. During her stay on Celebrity Big Brother 5, Shetty was the target of racism and bullying by other housemates, chiefly by Jade Goody, Jo O'Meara and Danielle Lloyd. After correcting Goody's mother, who mispronounced Shetty's name as 'Shiwpa', Shetty was mocked for her Indian accent and was branded \"The Indian\" and was referred to as a \"dog\" by Lloyd. Referring to Shetty, O'Meara generalised that all Indians were thin because they were \"sick all the time\" as a result of undercooking their food, following their belief that Shetty had undercooked a chicken, which gave O'Meara diarrhoea. Lloyd also mentioned that she didn't like Shetty touching her food because she didn't \"know where her hands have been\". Lloyd, O'Meara and Goody repeatedly maintained a belief that Shetty was \"fake\", and \"a mole\". After Shetty attempted to dispose of the left-over chicken soup down the toilet and caused a blockage, housemate Jack Tweed suggested that she should pick the bones out with her teeth and allegedly referred to her as a \"fucking Paki\", although show producers denied this and stated that the word used was \"cunt\". During a fierce argument, Goody told Shetty that she needed to \"spend a day in the slums\", although the media falsely reported this as \"go back to the slums\". Claiming that she did not know Shilpa's surname, Goody referred to her as \"Shilpa Fuckawallah\", \"Shilpa Daroopa\", and \"Shilpa Poppadom\", later claiming that they were non-racist references to Indian food. Lloyd had opined that Shetty's English-speaking skills were lacking and verbally indicated her desire that the latter should \"fuck off home\". Shetty had been reduced to tears on several occasions, confiding to fellow housemate Ian Watkins: \"I feel like I'm losing my dignity.\" After the show, Goody stated that she understood her comments appeared as racist and apologized for any offence caused. On 14 February 2007, Shetty said \"Jade and Danielle did apologise. And I've forgiven them. Anyone, who knows me, knows I forgive and forget easily.\"\u00a0On 17 February 2007, Shetty said that she wanted to forgive Jo O'Meara, but she and other\u00a0Celebrity Big Brother\u00a0contestants had difficulty contacting her. After Goody apologised to Shetty for her behaviour, Tweed stated that he was very disappointed with Goody for apologizing, and called Shetty a \"dick\" after previously describing her as a \"wanker\". Shetty speculated that she might be a victim of racism, but later retracted it by claiming: \"People say things in anger.\" \u00a0In May 2007, Lloyd attended the premiere of Shetty's film\u00a0Life in a... Metro\u00a0in London, in which the two were photographed together. The screening of the racial comments on UK television resulted in national and international media coverage, responses from the UK and Indian governments, and the show's suspension during the 2008 season. Many agencies and corporations cancelled their contracts with the housemates accused of racism, citing the allegations as the reason for the terminations. Also, many sponsors of the Big Brother series cancelled or suspended their sponsorship of the show. After conducting an investigation, Ofcom ruled that Channel 4 had breached the Ofcom code of conduct, and statutory sanctions were placed on the network. On 15 April 2007, the American actor Richard Gere hugged and forcefully kissed Shetty on the cheek during an AIDS-awareness event. In response, a number of protesters, including alleged members of the extremist Hindu group Shiv Sena, beat burning effigies of Gere with sticks. The protests occurred in a variety of cities, including Varanasi, Bhopal, Kanpur, Indore, Delhi and Mumbai. Others set fire to glamour shots of Shetty. Some groups demanded an apology from her and threatened to ban her movies in the state. Shiv Sena leaders denied involvement in the protests, but Shiv Sena member of parliament Sanjay Raut observed that the protests are \"just a manifestation of the anger of the general public\" and that there was \"nothing wrong with expressing contempt at such an act\". Shetty responded to these protests by saying, \"I understand this (kissing) is his (Gere's) culture, not ours. But this was not a big thing or so obscene for people to overreact in such a manner. I struggle to understand these people's sentiments, but mainly I do not want a foreigner to take bad memories from here.\" On 26 April 2007, an Indian court in Rajasthan issued a warrant for Shetty and Gere's arrest. A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by the Chief Justice of India subsequently dismissed the suit and suspended the arrest warrants. Gere has since expressed regret for causing any offence and Shetty has said, \"so much has been blown out of proportion.\" Although Shetty had previously worked with Akshay Kumar in Main Khiladi Tu Anari (1994), she began dating him on the sets of Insaaf (1997), when the latter had just split from the actress Raveena Tandon. Shetty spoke openly about her relationship with Kumar. The Indian media speculated on an engagement, and reported that Kumar wanted Shetty to quit films and settle down, however, Shetty had stated that she had no plans to marry currently. The couple broke up in 2000 whilst filming Dhadkan. In February 2009, Shetty began dating businessman Raj Kundra, with whom she was the co-owner of the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket team Rajsthan Royals. The two married on 22 November 2009. The couple have a son born in 2012. In February 2007, Shetty attended a reception at the House of Commons by invitation of Keith Vaz MP to meet with then Prime Minister Tony Blair. She was also invited to meet with Queen Elizabeth II at Marlborough House in London in March 2007. During an interview on This Morning, Shetty confirmed that she had been asked to act in the British EastEnders soap opera, and turned it down as it would mean all her other arrangements would have to go on hold. She was the subject of a Sky One documentary entitled The Real Shilpa Shetty, which was produced by British television production company Twofour. The large number of commercial offers that Shilpa received after winning Celebrity Big Brother themselves became reason for controversy with an increasing number of accusations about her riding the 'racism' wave to commercial gain. She was on the cover of the first issue of OK! Magazine to be sold in India. In early September 2007 she modelled at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week. On her agenda next is a cookery book titled Soul Curry and the role of Sita in Uru Patel's international venture Hanuman."

Given in an interview with The Times of India, Shetty revealed that, all of them used to participate in dance competition. Believing herself to be competitive at the age of 17, Kapoor played soccer and handball as she thought these games were challenging. Interviewing by The Hindustan Times in 2016, both Kapoor and Shroff admitted that, they had a crush on each other in school but never proposed to each one. Kapoor then enrolled in Boston University to major in psychology, but subsequently left her freshman year to appear in her debut film after she was seen on Facebook by producer Ambika Hinduja, who cast her for a role in Teen Patti. In an Interview with the Filmfare magazine, Shakti Kapoor revealed that Kapoor was barely 16 years old, when she was offered her first film by Salman Khan after he was fascinated by one of her school play performances but Kapoor considering herself to be studious rejected the proposal as she was also aspiring to become a psychologist. Kapoor was trained as a singer since her childhood as her maternal grandfather (the cousin of singers Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle), and mother are classical singers. Kapoor made her acting debut in the 2010 drama Teen Patti alongside Amitabh Bachchan, Ben Kingsley and R. Madhavan. She played the role of a college girl. The film received generally negative reviews though her performance was better received.

After her debut, she signed a three-film deal with Yash Raj Films and featured in their 2011 teen comedy Luv Ka The End with Taaha Shah. Kapoor portrayed the lead role of a teenage student who plots against her boyfriend after he cheats on her. The film underperformed at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics. However, Kapoor's performance received a positive critical reception. Taran Adarsh wrote: \u2033Shraddha is a revelation, catching you unaware with a confident performance. She's electrifying in the sequence when she breaks down after getting to know the true intentions of her lover.\u2033 Komal Nahta added: \u2033Shraddha Kapoor does well. She performs very confidently and impresses in her second film.\u2033 For her performance, Kapoor received the Stardust Searchlight Award for Best Actress. Kapoor was subsequently offered the lead female role in Aurangzeb as a part of her deal with Yash Raj Films. However, she signed on to Vishesh Films' Aashiqui 2 instead, thereby cancelling the three-film contract with Yash Raj Films.

        "artist_name": "Smita_Patil", 
        "biography": " Smita Patil (17 October 1955 \u2013 13 December 1986) was an Indian actress of film, television and theatre. Regarded among the finest stage and film actresses of her times, Patil appeared in over 80 Hindi and Marathi films in a career that spanned just over a decade. During her career, she received two National Film Awards and a Filmfare Award. She was the recipient of the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian honour in 1985. Patil graduated from the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune and made her film debut with Shyam Benegal's Charandas Chor (1975). She became one of the leading actresses of parallel cinema, a New Wave movement in India cinema, though she also appeared in several mainstream movies throughout her career. Her performances were often acclaimed, and her most notable roles include Manthan (1977), Bhumika (1977), Aakrosh (1980), Chakra (1981), Chidambaram (1985) and Mirch Masala (1985). Apart from acting, Patil was an active feminist and a member of the Women's Centre in Mumbai. She was deeply committed to the advancement of women's issues, and gave her endorsement to films which sought to explore the role of women in traditional Indian society, their sexuality, and the changes facing the middle-class woman in an urban milieu. Patil was married to actor Raj Babbar. She died on 13 December 1986 at the age of 31 due to childbirth complications. Over ten of her films were released after her death. Her son Prateik Babbar is a film actor who made his debut in 2008.   Smita Patil was born in Pune into a Kunbi Maratha family to a Maharashtrian politician, Shivajirao Girdhar Patil and social worker mother Vidyatai Patil, from Shirpur town (Village-Bhatpure) of Khandesh province of Maharashtra State. She studied at Renuka Swaroop Memorial high school in Pune. Her first tryst with the camera was in the 1970s as a television newscaster on Mumbai Doordarshan, the Indian government run broadcaster. Smita Patil belongs to a generation of actresses, including Shabana Azmi and, like her, who are strongly associated with the radically political cinema of the 1970s. Her work includes films with parallel cinema directors like Shyam Benegal, Govind Nihalani, Satyajit Ray (Sadgati, 1981), G. Aravindan (Chidambaram, 1985) and Mrinal Sen as well as forays into the more commercial Hindi film industry cinema of Mumbai. Patil was working as a TV news reader and was also an accomplished photographer when Shyam Benegal discovered her. She was an alumna of the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune. In 1977, she won the National Award for 'Best Actress' for her performance in the Hindi film Bhumika. In her films, Patil's character often represents an intelligent femininity that stands in relief against the conventional background of male-dominated cinema (films like Bhumika, Umbartha, and Bazaar). Smita Patil was a women's rights activist and became famous for her roles in films that portrayed women as capable and empowered. \"I remained committed to small cinema for about five years ... I refused all commercial offers. Around 1977-78, the small cinema movement started picking up and they needed names. I was unceremoniously dropped from a couple of projects. This was a very subtle thing but it affected me a lot. I told myself that here I am and I have not bothered to make money. I have turned down big, commercial offers because of my commitment to small cinema and what have I got in return? If they want names I'll make a name for myself. So I started and took whatever came my way.\" In time she was accepted by commercial filmmakers and from Raj Khosla and Ramesh Sippy to B.R. Chopra, they all agreed that she was \"excellent.\" Her fans, too, grew with her new-found stardom. Patil's glamorous roles in her more commercial films\u00a0\u2014 such as Shakti and Namak Halaal\u00a0\u2014 revealed the permeable boundaries between \"serious\" cinema and \"Hindi cinema\" masala in the Hindi film industry. In 1984, she served as a jury member of the Montreal World Film Festival. Her association with artistic cinema remained strong, however. Her arguably greatest (and unfortunately final) role came when Smita re-teamed with Ketan Mehta to play the feisty and fiery Sonbai in Mirch Masala (1987). Smita won raves for playing a spirited spice-factory worker who stands up against a lecherous petty official. On the centenary of Indian cinema in April 2013, Forbes included her performance in the film on its list, \"25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema\". During the making of Chakra, Smita Patil used to visit the slums in Bombay. It culminated in another National Award. When she became romantically involved with actor Raj Babbar, Patil drew severe criticism from her fans and the media, clouding her personal life and throwing her into the eye of a media storm. Raj Babbar left his wife Nadira Babbar to marry Patil. Smita died from childbirth complications on 13 December 1986, age 31, barely two weeks after having given birth to her son, Prateik Babbar. Nearly two decades later, one of India's greatest film directors, Mrinal Sen alleged that Smita Patil had died due to gross medical negligence. In 2011, Rediff.com listed her as the second-greatest actress of all time, behind Nargis. According to Suresh Kohli from Deccan Herald, \"Smita Patil was, perhaps, the most accomplished actress of Hindi cinema. Her oeuvre is outstanding, investing almost every portrayal with a powerhouse realistic performance.\" In 2012, the Smita Patil Documentary and Short Film Festival was initiated in her honor.  Nominated, Filmfare Best Actress Award National Film Award for Best Actress Winner, Marathi Rajya Chitrapat Puraskar for Best Actress On the occasion of 100 years of the Indian cinema, a postage stamp bearing her face was released by India Post to honour her on 3 May 2013."

She is daughter of actors Shatrughan and Poonam. After working as a costume designer in her early career, Sonakshi made her debut in action-drama film Dabangg (2010) which led her to win the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. Sinha has played the romantic interest of the male protagonists in several top-grossing action-dramas, including Rowdy Rathore (2012), Son of Sardaar (2012), Dabangg 2 (2012) and Holiday: A Soldier Is Never Off Duty (2014), though she was criticised for taking up roles that offered her limited scope. She received critical acclaim for her portrayal of a woman suffering from tuberculosis in the romantic drama Lootera (2013), for which she was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress in 2013. She sung a small part in the Imran Khan song \"Let's Celebrate\" from the movie Tevar. She then made her official singing debut with the single \"Aaj Mood Isqholic hai\" , which was released on 23rd December, 2015. She also sung \"Rajh Rajh me\" from Akira and \"Move your Lakh \" for Noor with Diljit and Badshah.   Sinha was born on 2 June 1987 in Patna into a Bihari Kayastha family. Her father, Shatrughan Sinha and her mother Poonam Sinha (n\u00e9e Chandiramani) are actors in Hindi Cinema. Her father is now a political member of Bharatiya Janata Party. She is the youngest of three children, her two elder brothers, Luv Sinha and Kush Sinha are twin. She did her schooling at Arya Vidya Mandir and later graduated in fashion designing from Shreemati Nathibai Damodar Thackersey Women's University. Sinha started her career as a costume designer, designing the costumes for films like Mera Dil Leke Dekho in 2005. She made her acting debut in the 2010 film Dabangg, in which she starred opposite Salman Khan. It went on to become the highest-grossing film of 2010 and ultimately emerged as an all-time blockbuster. Sinha had to lose 30\u00a0kg in preparation for the role as a village girl. Her performance was well received, with noted critic Taran Adarsh noting that \"Sonakshi Sinha looks fresh, acts confidently and pairs off very well with Salman. Most importantly, she delivers the right expressions and is not overpowered by the galaxy of stars in the cast.\" Although Sinha had no film releases in 2011, she won awards for her debut. This included the Filmfare Award as well as the IIFA Awards among many others. Sinha had four releases in 2012, her first being Prabhu Deva's Rowdy Rathore, opposite Akshay Kumar. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics, although it had a strong opening at the box office, collecting approx. \u20b9150.6 million (US$2.3\u00a0million) on the first day and eventually became a blockbuster. However, critic Rajeev Masand criticized her ornamental role and wrote that Sinha \"seems to exist in this film only to have her midriff repeatedly pinched by Akshay Kumar.\" Her next film, Shirish Kunder's Joker, also opposite Akshay Kumar, proved to be a trade disaster at the box office and received overwhelmingly negative reviews. Her third film, Ashwni Dhir's Son of Sardar opposite Ajay Devgan was poorly received by the critics but proved to be an economic success. Critic Saibal Chatterjee from NDTV noted that Sinha \"endeavours to be pretty and dainty amid all the madness.\" Arbaaz Khan's Dabangg 2, the sequel to her immensely successful debut garnered little praise from critics, though proved to be a major financial success. Sinha also dubbed for the voice of Tooth in the Hindi version of Rise of the Guardians. Sinha's first film of 2013 was Vikramaditya Motwane's period romance-drama Lootera opposite Ranveer Singh. Despite receiving a lukewarm response at the box office, it and Sinha gathered praise, with Sinha's portrayal of Pakhi, a Bengali girl who is dying of tuberculosis, receiving universal acclaim from critics. Sarita Tanwar notes that \"the star of the film is undoubtedly Sonakshi Sinha [who gives] a mature and refined performance. She lives the character body and soul.\" Raja Sen agrees, saying that \"Sonakshi Sinha plays Pakhi beautifully, creating a character who is immaculately wide-eyed and possesses casual, yet unmistakable, grace. It is a performance that starts off dreamily soft and turns harder, and she does well-etched dialogue justice like few actresses can. There's a discernible vulnerability to Pakhi throughout the film, and Sinha brings out this fragility perfectly without ever overplaying it.\" Sinha appeared in Milan Luthria's crime romance film Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara!, the sequel to Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai, in which she was paired with Akshay Kumar again, as well as Imran Khan. The movie was a commercial disappointment and critic Mohar Basu labeled her \"a chatterbox replete with idioticity which the director frames as naiveness.\" She then appeared in Tigmanshu Dhulia's Bullett Raja opposite Saif Ali Khan, a box-office flop. Her final release of the year was Prabhu Deva's R... Rajkumar opposite Shahid Kapoor. A moderate commercial success, the film and her performance received negative reviews. Taran Adarsh labeled her \"repetitive\" and noted that she needed to \"reinvent herself.\" In 2014, after providing her voice for the voice of Jewel in the Hindi-dubbed Rio 2, Sinha was seen in A.R. Murugadoss's action thriller Holiday: A Soldier Is Never Off Duty, a remake of the director's Tamil film Thuppakki. Starring opposite Akshay Kumar, Sinha appeared as a boxer. It received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics and emerged as a box office hit. Jyoti Sharma Bawa said of Sinha's portrayal: \"Sonakshi has nothing to do much in the film and overacts in places. For an actor who has already proved her mettle in the acting department, this definitely is a downer.\" Sinha appeared in a music video with Yo Yo Honey Singh titled Superstar. In July, Sinha jointly bought a team in the World Kabaddi League. Her second release of 2014 was Prabhu Deva's Action Jackson with Ajay Devgn and Yami Gautam. She made her Kollywood debut opposite Rajnikanth in KS Ravikumar's Lingaa, her final release in 2014. She then appeared in Boney Kapoor's remake of Okkadu titled Tevar (2015) opposite Arjun Kapoor. For the last of these, Rajeev Masand wrote, \"Sonakshi Sinha, playing another simpering damsel in another South remake, once again has nothing to do. She appears content showing up for a few dance numbers, and waiting around for a man to save her.\" Sonakshi released her debut single 'Aaj Mood Ishqholic Hai' in collaboration with Meet Bros on 23 December 2015. As of July 2016, Sinha has completed work on the remake of the 2011 Tamil film Mouna Guru, entitled Akira, an action-drama from director AR Murugadoss in which she plays an aggressive college student and Abhinay Deo's action-thriller Force 2 opposite John Abraham.

She also confirmed that she will perform as the opening act for Canadian singer Justin Bieber's Purpose World Tour concert at the DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai on 10 May, where she hopes to launch her new single. Sonakshi Sinha is a professed animal lover, and she had posed for a PETA campaign advocating the adoption and sterilization of dogs and cats. She has starred in a one-minute video PSA, urging everyone to adopt animals and have them sterilised. She has been quoted saying \"\"Breeders, pet stores and people who don't sterilize their animals are responsible for all the animals who end up homeless. Every time someone buys a dog or cat from a breeder or pet store, a homeless animal roaming the streets or waiting in an animal shelter loses a chance at a home and a good life.\""

        "artist_name": "Sonam_Kapoor", 
        "biography": " Sonam Kapoor (pronounced\u00a0[so\u02d0n\u0259m k\u0259\u02c8pu\u02d0r]; born 9 June 1985) is an Indian actress who appears in Bollywood films. Kapoor is one of the highest-paid actresses in the industry and is the recipient of several awards, including a Filmfare and a National Film Award. Starting in 2012, she appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 based on her income and popularity. The daughter of actor Anil Kapoor, Kapoor studied theatre and arts at the United World College of South East Asia in Singapore. She was an assistant director to Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the 2005 film Black. Kapoor made her acting debut in Bhansali's romantic drama Saawariya (2007), for which she was nominated for a Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. She had her first commercial success three years later in the romantic comedy I Hate Luv Storys (2010). After a series of commercial failures, the sleeper hit Raanjhanaa (2013) marked a turning point in her career, earning her several Best Actress nominations. She then featured in the 2014 romantic comedy Khoobsurat and the 2015 comedy drama Dolly Ki Doli, both of which earned her Filmfare Award for Best Actress nominations. Kapoor played a princess in the melodrama Prem Ratan Dhan Payo (2015), one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time. She received the National Film Award \u2013 Special Mention and Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress for portraying the much praised titular role in the biographical thriller Neerja (2016), one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films featuring a female protagonist. Kapoor supports various charities and causes, such as raising awareness of breast cancer and LGBT rights. She is known in the media for her outspoken personality, is frequently credited as one of Bollywood's most fashionable celebrities, and is a prominent celebrity endorser for brands and products.   Kapoor was born in the Mumbai suburb of Chembur on 9 June 1985. Her father is actor and producer Anil Kapoor, the son of the late filmmaker Surinder Kapoor and the founder of the Anil Kapoor Films Company. Her mother, Sunita, is a former model and designer. Kapoor has two younger siblings: film producer Rhea and brother Harshvardhan. She is the niece of film producer Boney Kapoor and actor Sanjay Kapoor; actress Sridevi and producer Mona Shourie (Boney's wives) are her aunts. Kapoor's paternal cousins are actors Arjun Kapoor and Mohit Marwah, and maternal cousin is actor Ranveer Singh. The family moved to the suburb of Juhu when Kapoor was one month old. She was educated at the Arya Vidya Mandir school in Juhu, where she confessed to being a \"naughty\" and \"carefree\" child who would bully the boys. She excelled at sports such as rugby and basketball, and trained in Kathak, classical music and Latin dance. Kapoor, who practices Hinduism, states that she is \"quite religious\", and that it is a way of \"reminding myself that I need to be thankful for so much\". Kapoor's first job was as a waitress at age 15, although it lasted only a week. As a teenager, she struggled with her weight: \"I had every issue related to weight that I could have. I was unhealthy, I had bad skin, and I had hair growing on my face!\" Kapoor was diagnosed with insulin resistance and polycystic ovarian disease, and has since begun an initiative to increase awareness of diabetes. Kapoor enrolled at the United World College of South East Asia in Singapore for her pre-university education, where she studied theatre and arts. She has said she later started courses in economics and political science through University of Mumbai correspondence programme, after returning from University of East London where she began her bachelor's degree in the same subjects but returned to Mumbai soon after she began. The actress Rani Mukerji, a family friend, visited her family in Singapore on holiday while working on Black (2005). Kapoor, who had originally wanted to be a director and writer, expressed a desire to work as a crew member on the film. On her father's recommendation to director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, she was appointed as his assistant. During the production of Black, Kapoor developed an interest in acting when Bhansali professed that he wanted to cast her in the lead in his next film, Saawariya. She was advised to lose weight; at the time, she weighed about 80 kilograms (180\u00a0lb). Motivated by Bhansali's confidence in her, she lost 35 kilograms (77\u00a0lb) in two years. Kapoor studied acting with Roshan Taneja, Jayati Bhatia and Feroz Abbas Khan, and has cited actresses Waheeda Rehman and Nutan as influences, admiring their \"path-breaking films \u2026 [and] quality of doing different things\". Released in 2007, Saawariya saw Kapoor play a Muslim woman awaiting the return of her lover opposite Mukerji and Ranbir Kapoor. It was the first Indian feature film produced by a Hollywood studio, Sony Pictures Entertainment. Saawariya proved to be a major critical and commercial failure. Writing for BBC, Jaspreet Pandohar called the film a \"misfire on a massive scale\". Raja Sen of Rediff.com described her laugh as \"almost as infectious as her father's\", but wished that she had been \"allowed to simper softly, instead of having a clearly overdubbed plastic giggle plastered onto her.\" The film earned her a Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut nomination and the Stardust Award for Superstar of Tomorrow\u00a0\u2013 Female. In 2009, Kapoor played an aspiring singer opposite Waheeda Rehman and Abhishek Bachchan in the Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra-directed drama Delhi-6. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was not a box-office success. CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand referred to Kapoor as a \"revelation\", writing that she was \"a firecracker, instinctive and uninhibited in what isn't even a conventional female lead\". Sonia Chopra of Sify described Kapoor as an \"earnest and effortless performer\", and found her character likeable, despite the \"typical Delhi-girl recipe\". Kapoor's first release in 2010 was Punit Malhotra's romantic comedy I Hate Luv Storys, opposite Imran Khan. She played an engaged woman who develops a one-sided attraction to her commitment-phobic co-worker. Khan said about Kapoor's craft, \"We'd be shooting a scene from multiple angles\u2014for three or four hours you're doing the same scene, the same lines\u2014and here is this person [Kapoor] who brings consistency to her work, from the way she talks, to her accent.\" Although Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called Kapoor's performance \"stiff and rehearsed\", Daily News and Analysis' Johnson Thomas found her \"likeable and believable\". I Hate Luv Storys was Kapoor's first commercial success, earning \u20b9725.2 million (US$11\u00a0million) worldwide. Kapoor next played the eponymous role in Aisha, a romantic comedy adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Emma, which was produced by her sister Rhea. She described her role opposite Abhay Deol, Ira Dubey and Amrita Puri as \"a meddlesome busybody with a passion for matchmaking and playing Cupid\". An Indo-Asian News Service reviewer thought that Kapoor had stood out with her performance, making \"the best of a rather rare opportunity for an Indian leading lady to be part of a Bollywood film that salutes Victorian mores and Delhi's elitist affectations in one clean cool sweep\". In 2011, Kapoor starred in Thank You, a comedy about three women who teach a lesson to their philandering husbands. The film, along with Kapoor's performance, received poor reviews; Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India called her \"terribly out of sync\". She then played the romantic interest of Shahid Kapoor in the Pankaj Kapur-directed romantic drama, Mausam, which was also poorly received. Despite doubts about her acting ability, critic Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV thought Kapoor conveyed \"the essential vulnerability of a girl forever under duress, bringing out just the right mix of feminine fragility and native resolve\". The following year, Kapoor played a computer hacker opposite Abhishek Bachchan and Bipasha Basu in the Abbas\u2013Mustan-directed action film, Players, a remake of 2003's The Italian Job. Her role was originally written for Katrina Kaif, who was unavailable for the film. Although journalists had high expectations, it failed commercially, and Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com remarked derogatively that Kapoor \"truly entertains with her childish attempt to pass off as a Gold-medalist hacker\". Kapoor's string of poorly-received films began to hinder her career. Kapoor's role in the Anand L. Rai-directed romantic drama Raanjhanaa (2013) marked a turning point in her career; Geety Sahgal called it her best performance to date in The Indian Express. Kapoor's role was that of Zoya Haider, a young Muslim student from Varanasi who is drawn into politics after the murder of her Sikh lover. To prepare for her part, Kapoor interacted with students, attended workshops and practiced with theatre groups associated with Jawaharlal Nehru University. She also studied Jaya Bachchan's work in Guddi (1971), which she felt was \"perfect\" for her role. Discussing her character in the film, Kapoor described her approach to acting: \"I have always tried to do different films and \u2026 I try to be different for every character. I like doing different things to challenge myself in every way and don't like to repeat myself.\" Although Raanjhanaa received mixed reviews, her performance was praised; Rajeev Masand wrote that she \"does some of her best work here, going smoothly from innocent to manipulative to cynical, without ever losing Zoya's inherent vulnerability\". With worldwide earnings of over \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million), Raanjhanaa was a commercial success and Kapoor received her first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Kapoor followed the success of Raanjhanaa with a brief appearance in Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (2013), a biopic on athlete Milkha Singh. She received \u20b911 (17\u00a2\u00a0US) for the film, made on a budget of \u20b9300 million (US$4.6\u00a0million), citing her admiration for director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and the film itself as reasons for her appearance. Critically praised, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag was one of the top-grossing Bollywood films of the year. The critic Sarita A. Tanwar wrote in her review that despite her minor role, Kapoor proved to \"be the perfect warm counterpart to Milkha\". Both Raanjhanaa and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag received Filmfare Award for Best Film nominations, the latter of which won. In 2014, Kapoor portrayed the banker Mayera opposite Ayushmann Khurrana and Rishi Kapoor in the Yash Raj Films comedy-drama Bewakoofiyaan, in a role which Anupama Chopra found to be poorly written and an \"uphill climb\". She next starred with Fawad Khan in the romantic comedy Khoobsurat, an adaptation of the 1980 film of the same name, playing the role which had originally been given to Rekha. Though she received a Filmfare Best Actress nomination for her performance, critics were divided in their response, with Shilpa Jamkhandikar of Reuters calling her \"loud and exasperating\", and Andy Webster of The New York Times' comparing her to a young Anne Hathaway and highlighting her \"Julia Roberts-like smile\". Later that year she met entrepreneur-model Sahir Berry on a social media network, and began a romantic relationship with him, although they broke up a few months later. In 2015, Kapoor starred as a runaway bride in Dolly Ki Doli, a comedy co-starring Pulkit Samrat, Rajkummar Rao and Varun Sharma. Mint's Udita Jhunjhunwala criticised Kapoor's performance in the film, writing that her \"range is too limited to bring alive a character that may have had heaps of potential on paper\". Shubhra Gupta wrote: \"Kapoor is in almost every frame, and should have filled them all. But the treatment of the character shows up her limitations.\" Despite the negative reviews for her performance, she was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. While filming Sooraj\u00a0R. Barjatya's Prem Ratan Dhan Payo with Salman Khan in Gondal, Gujarat in February 2015, Kapoor was diagnosed with swine influenza, from which she recovered the following month. Kapoor portrayed Rajkumari Maithili Devi, a princess looking for love. The film became one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time. She was praised by Rachit Gupta for her credibility as a royal, and Komal Nahta thought that the role was significant enough to be a turning point in her career. However, she won a Golden Kela Award for Worst Actress. Following an appearance in the music video of Coldplay's \"Hymn for the Weekend\" (featuring Beyonc\u00e9), Kapoor starred in Ram Madhvani's biographical thriller Neerja (2016). She was cast as the eponymous air hostess Neerja Bhanot, who died while saving the passengers of the hijacked Pan Am Flight 73 in 1986. Kapoor felt responsible towards the project because it is about real events, and met Bhanot's family as a preparation for her role. The film garnered wide critical acclaim, and several commentators considered Kapoor's performance to be her best to date. Raja Sen found her performance to be career-defining, while Hindustan Times' Rohit Vats wrote that \"she carries [the film] entirely on her shoulder. She looks earnest, scared, benevolent and bold, all at the same time.\" Sen listed Kapoor as the best actress in Hindi cinema in 2016, while Rajeev Masand invited her to his annual best actresses roundtable. In addition to several other accolades, Kapoor won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress and National Film Award for Special Mention. With a worldwide gross over \u20b91.35 billion (US$21\u00a0million), the film emerged as one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films featuring a female protagonist. As of December 2016, Kapoor has committed to play one of the lead roles in Shahanka Ghosh's directorial debut film Veere Di Wedding, a romantic comedy co-starring Kareena Kapoor, Swara Bhaskar and Shikha Talsania about four girls who embark on a trip from Delhi to Europe. She has begun filming R. Balki's Padman opposite Akshay Kumar, and has signed on for Rajkumar Hirani's Untitled Sanjay Dutt biopic. Born into a prominent actor family, Kapoor has appeared in the media from an early age, and is one of the highest-paid actresses in Bollywood. After the success of Raanjhanaa and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag she was cited by Subhash K. Jha as one of the top actresses in India, though a commentator for Rediff.com notes that several of her films have been commercial failures. In 2009 she was the first Indian actress to appear on The Hollywood Reporter's \"Next Generation: Asia Class\", a list of newcomers in film. Outspoken publicly, Kapoor's comments about contemporaries and others in the Indian film industry have occasionally caused controversy. In a 2015 interview, she acknowledged that her opinions often get her into trouble, but remarked that \"I believe it pays to be honest in the longer run\". Kapoor is a popular figure nationally, with a significant following on Twitter since 2009 and Facebook. She appeared on The Huffington Post's list of \"100 most influential women on Twitter\" in 2015. She has been described by the media as a style icon, and featured on Rediff.com's list of \"Bollywood's Best Dressed Actresses\" in 2012 and 2013. In 2013, the newspaper Hindustan Times and Indian edition of Vogue called her Style Icon (Reader's Choice) and Beauty of the Year, respectively. Though Kapoor has earned praise for her dress sense and style, she has faced some criticism for wearing traditional Indian dresses. Kapoor was ranked seventh on The Times of India's 2010 \"Most Desirable Woman\" list, placing 14th, 28th and 14th the next three years, and was in the top ten of UK magazine Eastern Eye's \"World's Sexiest Asian Women\" list from 2011 to 2014. In 2012 and 2013 she also held 48th and 45th place, respectively, on the Indian edition of Forbes' \"Celebrity 100\" lists, based on the income and popularity of Indian celebrities. She was named Woman of the Year by the men's magazine GQ India in 2013. In 2014 and 2015, Kapoor reached 31st place and 26th position, respectively, peaking at the 18th position the following year with an annual income of \u20b9200 million (US$3.1\u00a0million).

Kapoor has supported charitable organisations for various causes. In 2009, she participated in the International Indian Film Academy Awards fashion show, which supports widows and orphans of Indian film-industry workers. On behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) she wrote to Maharashtra Home Minister R. R. Patil, protesting against the use of glass-coated manja (used on fighter kites), which kills birds who become entangled in it. Kapoor is vocal in her support for LGBT rights in India. In 2012, Kapoor asked fans to donate to the Ogaan Cancer Foundation for her birthday, and collaborated with the foundation to increase awareness of breast cancer. She is also the brand ambassador for the Elle Breast Cancer Campaign. Kapoor auctioned some of her clothes on stylist Pernia Qureshi's online fashion boutique, Pernia's Pop-Up Shop, in 2012. The proceeds were donated to Smile Foundation, a child-welfare organisation. In 2014, she attended a charitable art exhibition organised by the Rouble Nagi Art Foundation, and donated clothing and accessories to a website raising funds for In Defense of Animals. Kapoor walked the ramp in a 2015 fashion show by Manish Malhotra for the Mijwan Welfare Society, a non-profit organisation dedicated to empowering girls.

Hell, she made Sunny Deol and Rajnikant look like sidekicks in the film\". while the Times of India article 'Bollywood's Hit Double Roles' gushed \"Sridevi's performance rocked the box office\". Rediff featured the film in its countdown of '25 Best Double Roles in Bollywood' saying \"What you don't realise until you have seen Chaalbaaz is just how incredible Sridevi is at depicting both ends of the spectrum\" and that the film \"cemented her position as an actress with a killer comic timing\". Speaking to Indian Express about Sridevi's act in Chaalbaaz, the director Pankaj Parashar said \"She proved her range with the movie and after that she got lots of offers which saw her in a double role\". Her slapstick rain dance 'Na jaane kahan se aayi hai' became a big hit with Times of India describing it as a \"Sridevi classic where she simply looked wow with her chirpy expressions and rain drops kissing her cheeks\". This twin-sister act won Sridevi her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress in Hindi films while the song received the Filmfare Award for Best Choreography. The same year also saw the release of the Yash Chopra romantic saga Chandni with Sridevi playing the title role. According to iDiva, the film was \"more an event and less a movie\". Chandni emerged as one of the biggest blockbusters of 1989 with The Hindu stating that \"the film opened to full houses and distributors had to drastically increase the number of theatres\". Cited by Times of India as \"one of the most watched films of Indian Cinema\", the film also reaffirmed Sridevi\u2019s position as the top female star of the 1980s.  While Sridevi topped the Hindustan Times list of Yash Chopra's 'Top 5 Heroines', CNN-IBN also ranked her no.1 on its list of 'Yash Chopra's 10 Most Sensuous Heroines' saying \"Yash Chopra immortalised Sridevi as the perfect Chandni\". The title role became one of the most famous characters of Hindi Cinema with India Today including it in its list of 'Yash Chopra's Iconic Characters' while NDTV featured it in its list of 'Yash Chopra's Greatest Creations' stating that the film established Sridevi \"as the nation's sweetheart\".  The Tribune wrote \"Leena Daru scored a winner again when she created the 'Chandni Look' for Sridevi. Every street corner sold the salwar-kameez and dupatta that gave the heroine a refreshingly understated look, rarely seen on the Indian screen\". while Mid Day reported that the \"simple white churidar and kurta with the leheriya dupatta gave Sridevi an angelic image and caused Chandni Chowk stores to hit the jackpot with thousands of copies\". The music of Chandni became a Platinum Success with Sridevi's famous dance number 'Mere Hathon Mein Nau Nau Choodiyan' finding a place in the Rediff chart of 'Bollywood's Top 25 Wedding Songs.' The actress also lent her voice to the film's popular title-track 'Chandni O Meri Chandni'. which featured among the 'Top 5 Songs' of Yash Chopra by Hindustan Times. Chandni won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment while Sridevi garnered Filmfare Best Actress nominations for both Chandni and Chaalbaaz in 1989 winning for the latter. Yash Chopra again cast Sridevi in his 1991 film Lamhe. Times of India included it in its list of 'Top 10 Films of Yash Chopra' describing it as a tale of \"love transcending the boundaries of time and space\" while Rediff called it \"Quite easily one of his most definitive films, Chopra surpassed his own findings of romance with the insightful, lovely Lamhe\". Sridevi played both mother and daughter cast in what iDiva described as \"another double role but it was unlike any played before\". Hailed by Rediff as \"one of the most remarkable films of her career...often considered a film way ahead of its time\", Her performance brought her much acclaim with BizAsia stating that \"Her rendition of both Pallavi and Pooja serves well in highlighting how versatile she is as an actress, playing contrasting characters in the same movie\". Sridevi's folk dance number 'Morni Baga ma' also became a rage and was placed among the 'Top 5 Songs' of Yash Chopra by Hindustan Times. Lamhe failed commercially but received high critical praise and has over the years become a cult classic. Talking about the film, critic Rachel Dwyer wrote in her biography of the film-maker \"Yash Chopra's own favourite film, Lamhe ('Moments', 1991), divided the audience on a class basis: it was hugely popular with metropolitan elites and the overseas market, which allowed it to break even, but it had a poor box-office response (largely lower class, especially the repeat audience) because of its supposed incest theme\". The Hindu reported that \"With shades of incest, Lamhe caused more than a flutter and remained the talk of the town\" while Sridevi herself admitted in an interview with Rajeev Masand that she found the subject \"too bold\". Though the film flopped with Rediff describing its failure as \"one of those bizarre, unexplained moments of cinema\", Lamhe picked up five Filmfare trophies including Filmfare Award for Best Film and Sridevi's second Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Her popular Rajasthani costumes in the film also won designer Neeta Lulla her first National Film Award for Best Costume Design. In 1992, Sridevi starred in the epic Khuda Gawah opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The actress played a double role again as an Afghani warrior Benazir and her daughter Mehendi. Shot extensively in Afghanistan, the film did good business with BBC reporting that \"it ran to packed houses for 10 weeks in Kabul\". Khuda Gawah still remains popular in the Afghan country and Rediff reported that the film is \"in great demand after the opening of cinema halls in the country\". The film picked up the Filmfare Award for Best Director while Sridevi earned a Filmfare nomination for Best Actress. The actress's big budget 1993 release Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja was one of India's most expensive films ever made. Though the film failed at the box-office, Sridevi was appreciated with Times of India calling her disguise in a comedy scene \"the best ever South Indian role played by any actress\". Sridevi continued to get central roles with big banners like the Dharma Productions venture Gumrah opposite Sanjay Dutt. Directed by Mahesh Bhatt, the actress played a singer falsely accused of drugs smuggling in Hong Kong. Bollyspice stated in its 'Sridevi Retrospective' that \"Despite very good performances from the rest of the cast, Gumrah was really Sridevi\u2019s film. She managed to exemplify female emotion and robustness to a great degree that you remember the film largely for her significant contribution towards it\". Her performance received another nomination for Filmfare Best Actress Award. In 1994, Sridevi teamed up with Anil Kapoor again in Laadla playing business tycoon Sheetal Jaitley. The character, described by Times of India as \"rude, dominant and very competitive\" brought her yet another Filmfare nomination. The last major film Sridevi starred in before she took a break from the industry was Judaai released in 1997. Along with Anil Kapoor and Urmila Matondkar, the actress played a greedy housewife going to extreme lengths for money. Talking about her swan song, critic Subhash K. Jha wrote that Sridevi \"left us with the most stunning hurrah in Judaai. A terrible film that I've watched countless times to see her play the money-minded harridan who 'sells' her husband to Urmila Matondkar. Who but Sridevi could carry of such an outrageous role with such enthusiastic \u00e9lan?!\" while Bollyspice stated that \"She used her polished acting skills to illustrate her character\u2019s greed and individualism at such a grotesque level.\" Judaai won Sridevi her eighth Filmfare nomination for Best Actress. After a six-year hiatus, Sridevi briefly returned to the small screen in the Sahara sitcom Malini Iyer (2004\u20132005). She also appeared on Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai (2004) and as a judge in the TV show Kaboom (2005). She performed a medley of some of her musical numbers at the 52nd Filmfare Awards 2007.

Sridevi also developed passion for painting. In March 2010, her paintings were sold by an international art auction house with the money raised being donated. In 2011, Kareena Kapoor paid a tribute to Sridevi by performing to a selection of Sridevi's numbers at the Global Indian Film and Television Awards. Kapoor called Sridevi her hero and the reason why most girls of her generation became actresses. In May 2012, Sridevi appeared in Aamir Khan's TV show Satyamev Jayte as a surprise to an interviewee who had been sexually abused as a child.

Sridevi announced her comeback in early 2011, while working in a new film English Vinglish. directed by Gauri Shinde. Her return was officially announced at the IIFA Awards 2011 held in Toronto with a montage of Bollywood stars welcoming her back. After the Toronto premiere,some international media outlets hailed Sridevi as the \"Meryl Streep of India.\" Two weeks later America's entertainment weekly Variety wrote in its review of English Vinglish that it found Sridevi \"Disarmingly charming in a manner that recalls Audrey Hepburn.\" On release, the film and Sridevi's performance received positive response. The Times of India gave it 4/5 calling it \"Easily one of the best films of 2012...Sri's performance is a masterclass for actors...Request you to make a little place next to you, Rajkumar Hirani; Gauri Shinde has taken a bow in mainstream Bollywood.\" Another 4/5 came from Raja Sen of Rediff who found the film is \"a winner all the way...Sri excels in fleshing out her character.\" Critic Subhash K Jha gave a 4.5 saying Sridevi \"makes the contemporary actresses, even the coolest ones, look like jokes...If you watch only two films every year make sure you see \"English Vinglish\" twice!\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 3.5 stars saying Sridevi delivers \"a performance that is nothing short of perfect...It's warm and fuzzy, and leaves you with a big smile on your face.\" Anupama Chopra also gave it 3.5 calling it \"that rare thing...Sridevi doesn't miss a beat. Her performance is a triumph.\" Firstpost's Rubina Khan gave the film a full 5/5 saying \"Sridevi brings acting back in English Vinglish.\" Komal Nahta said it was 'beyond stars' applauded Sridevi saying she \"makes the best comeback in Bollywood history and delivers a landmark performance.\" Social movie rating site MOZVO gave it 4.1 out of 5 putting it in 'Must Watch' category.

Box Office Capsule hailed the film and Sridevi's return as \"Golden Comeback of the Queen.\" Director Gauri Shinde featured in the Financial Times 2012 list of '25 Indians To Watch'. Film critic Raja Sen from Rediff explained why she is ranked as No. 1 \"This is a simple film where things are credible, never melodramatic, and Sridevi\u00a0\u2013 in a range of well-picked cotton sarees\u00a0\u2013 always judges the tone right. It's the sort of performance younger actresses, including the ones on this list, should learn from.\" Sridevi was declared the most-admired Bollywood actress of 2012 in a mobile survey conducted by Vuclip, world's largest mobile research company. Furthermore, she was nominated for Best Actress in most of the award ceremonies, including the Filmfare awards, where she received her ninth nomination for Best Actress.

Aamir may have done about 50 films \u2014 he has a lot of time, as he does only one film per year; Shah Rukh may have done more than 100 films... Put together, we may have all done about 250-275 films. But there is one legend who is very talented, dedicated, hard working and professional. She completed 300 films, after starting her career as a child artiste. Our work cannot even be compared to this legend - she is none other than Sridevi!\".

The actress is also considered one of the most beautiful faces to have graced the Indian screen.

In 1968, he was honoured with the Padma Shri by the Government of India. In 1984 he joined the Indian National Congress party and was elected to Parliament of India for five terms from the constituency of Mumbai North West.   Sunil Dutt was born on 6 June 1930 in Khurd village, Jhelum district, Punjab Province, British India. When he was five years old, Dutt's father died. When he was 18, the Partition of India began inciting Hindu-Muslim violence across the country. A Muslim named Yakub, who had been friends with Dutt's father, saved their entire family. The family resettled in a small village on the bank of river Yamuna called Mandauli in Yamuna Nagar, Punjab, is now a district of Haryana. Later he moved to Lucknow and spent a long time in Aminabad Galli during graduation. He then moved to Bombay, where he joined Jai Hind College as an undergraduate and took up a job at the city's BEST Transport division. Starting out in radio, Sunil Dutt was hugely popular on the Hindi service of Radio Ceylon, the oldest radio station in South Asia. He moved to acting in Hindi films and got introduced to the industry with 1955's Railway Platform. He shot to stardom in the 1957 film Mother India where he co-starred with Nargis as her short-tempered, angry son. During the making of this film a fire happened on the sets. It is believed that Dutt braved the raging fire to save Nargis and thereby won her love. They went onto marry in 1958. They had one son Sanjay Dutt, also a successful film actor and two daughters, Priya Dutt and Namrata Dutt. His daughter Namrata married Kumar Gaurav, son of Rajendra Kumar. The two fathers were co-stars in Mother India.

His collaboration with B.R. Chopra proved to be successful in films such as Gumraah (1963), Waqt (1965) and Hamraaz (1967). One of his favourite writers and friends was Aghajani Kashmeri. Dutt created a record of sorts by directing and starring in the unique film Yaadein (1964) in which he was the only actor in the cast. He later turned producer of the 1968 film Man Ka Meet which introduced his brother Som Dutt who was unsuccessful in films. In 1971, he produced, directed and starred in Reshma Aur Shera (1971) which was a huge failure at the box office.

He founded the Nargis Dutt Foundation in her memory for the cure of cancer patients. He was a sponsor of the India Project, an organisation akin to Operation Smile for the treatment of Indian children with facial deformities. In 1982 he was appointed as the Sheriff of Mumbai, an apolitical titular position bestowed on him by the Maharashtra government for a year. He retired from the film industry in the early 1990s to turn to politics after his last few releases including Yash Chopra's Parampara (1992) and J.P. Dutta's Kshatriya (1993).

Well, the fact is, God has always been with them the entire time.\" In a 2010 interview, she said It's a community-based religion. You walk into a temple and you're greeted with the utmost respect... But, just like any religion it doesn't want you to shoot adult material. I mean, I grew up going to temple every Sunday. When my parents found out they knew my personality which was very independent. Even if they tried to stop me or tried to steer me the right way they would have lost their daughter. I'm too headstrong. And it wasn't a plan. It just happened and my career and everything just kept getting bigger and bigger. Pet of the Year: Zdenka Podkapov\u00e1 Pet of the Year: Sunny Leone"

        "artist_name": "Suraiya", 
        "biography": " Suraiya Jamaal Sheikh (15 June 1929 \u2013 31 January 2004) was an Indian Muslim Hindi/Hindustani film actress and playback singer in Bollywood in the 1940s to early 1960s, who remained unmarried throughout her life, after her love affair with actor Dev Anand was aborted by her maternal grandmother. She was the most popular singing star of the Indian sub-continent of her generation. Till 1943, as a child singer, Suraiya gave play-back for one actress, namely, Mehtab in three films and also in some of her own films for her roles as a child artiste. After this, she only sang for her own films as an actress, and as a heroine after 1946 till 1963. From 1948 to 1950, she became the singing superstar of Bollywood, earning the highest amount for her performances, over all the performing actors of the times, male or female, including Dev Anand, Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Nargis and Madhubala. She was the only child of her parents. She had a natural talent for singing, acting and dancing from childhood. She received basic training in music, when her mother used to take her to Hindustani music teacher or 'masterji' for training. She first sang for a children's program for All India Radio in 1937. Later on Naushad gave her on the job 'training', while recording. She went on to become a most successful singing film star of Bollywood. She first sang for a children's program for All India Radio in 1937. She had received training in dancing from Mumtaz Ali, dancer-actor and father of famous comedian, Mehmood. She was also known for her North Indian Muslim feudal style acting or 'adakari' in many of her films (Mirza Ghalib (film), Phool, Afsar, Shayar, Jeet (1949 film), Anmol Ghadi, Dastan). This style 'endowed modernity with an aura of tradition' and brought nostalgic feudal tinge to the scenes. Her performance 'expertly integrated gestures, music and speech'. Suraiya in her heydays was known as 'Malika-e-Husn' (queen of beauty), 'Malika-e-Tarannum' (queen of melody) and 'Malika-e-Adakaari' (queen of acting), all rolled into one.   Suraiya was born in Gujranwala, Punjab (British India) in a Muslim family to Mumtaz Begum and Aziz Jamaal Sheikh, who owned a furniture shop in Gujranwala. Soon, her father moved to Lahore and Suraiya was taken by her mother, Mumtaz Begum, and maternal grandmother, Badshah Begum to Bombay in early nineteen thirties, when she was one year old. Her maternal uncle, named Zahoor (also known as M. Zahoor) also came to Bombay and became a well known villain in films. Suraiya's father, later came to live with her and he died on the day of 'Holi' in March 1963. She attended New High School, now known as, J.B. Petit High School for Girls in Fort, Mumbai. Later, 1942 onwards, when she started singing for films as a 12 year old, her school principal Miss P.F. Patuck told her father not to let her be absent from school during school days. She sang for Mehtab in three films in 1942\u201343 and also acted and sang in a few films as a child artiste. In her childhood, Raju Bharatan, a few years younger to her who later became a famous music and sports writer, critic and correspondent, actor Raj Kapoor and composer Madan Mohan, both a few years older, were her neighbourhood friends. Raj Kapoor and Madan Mohan, both used to sing with her in A.I.R.(All India Radio), when she was a six-year-old girl. In fact, Madan Mohan first introduced her to A.I.R.(All India Radio) as a child singer. Later in life, Raju Bharatan wrote extensively about Suraiya in his books, while Raj Kapoor was her hero in one of her films, Dastan (1950), and Madan Mohan composed music for her film, Khubsoorat (1952). Suraiya made her debut as a child artist in 'Madam Fashion' in 1936, as Miss Suraiya, along with Nargis as Baby Rani. The film was directed by Jaddan Bai, mother of Nargis, with Jaddan Bai herself as heroine, and music and songs, also written and sung by her. Later, she got a prominent role as a child artiste with the help of her uncle M. Zahoor, who was then a popular villain in films. During a holiday from school in 1941, she accompanied him to Bombay's Mohan Studios to see the shooting of the film Taj Mahal (1941 film), which was being directed by Nanubhai Vakil. Vakil noticing the charm and innocence of young Suraiya, selected her to play the role of young Mumtaj Mahal. While she was singing for children's programs for All India Radio, Mumbai, as a six year old, Raj Kapoor and Madan Mohan who were her playmates in her neighbourhood and were 5\u20136 years older to her, used to be her co-artists. In fact, they first introduced her to AIR. Raj Kapoor, later, attained fame as an actor and a film maker, while Madan Mohan became well-known music director. Both were associated with her, later as an adult, as her hero and as her music director respectively in films. In AIR, Zulfiqar Ali Bukhari was then the Station Director at the Bombay Radio Station. Once, music director Naushad Ali heard Suraiya's voice, he chose her to sing as a 13-year-old for Mehtab in Abdul Rashid Kardar's film Sharda (1942). He became Suraiya's mentor and she sang some of the best songs of her career under his baton. Later he gave hits after hits when Suraiya became full-fledged singing star in Anmol Ghadi (1946), Dard (1947), Dillagi (1949) and Dastaan (1950). Naushad Ali composed approximately 51 songs for Suraiya, coming at 2nd place after Husnlal Bhagatram for composing the highest number of songs for Suraiya. As a child artist, she acted and also sang in Tamanna (1942), Station Master (1942), and Hamari Baat(1943). As an adult, Suraiya initially played as a co-star with the heroine in K. Asif's Phool, Mehboob Khan's Anmol Ghadi (1946), (which was written by Aghajani Kashmeri also known as Kashmiri) and Dard (1947). She acted as a heroine in the film Tadbir (1945) on the recommendation of K. L. Saigal, who liked her voice during a rehearsal of a song for Jayant Desai's film 'Samrat Chandragupt' (1945) in which she was acting. He recommended her name to Desai opposite himself in 'Tadbir' (1945). She went on to co-star with K. L. Saigal in Omar Khayyam (1946) and Parwana (1947 film). Although by then she had a couple of hit songs, but the four solo songs which she sang in Parwana for music director Khwaja Khurshid Anwar made her a genuine singer-film star. She had high regards for Khwaja Khurshid Anwar for whom she sang thirteen songs during 1943 to 1949 period. More opportunities arose for Suraiya after reigning famous actress Noor Jehan and Khursheed Bano migrated to Pakistan following the Partition of India in 1947. As an actress, Suraiya had an edge over her contemporaries Kamini Kaushal and Nargis, because she could sing her own songs. After three hits Pyar Ki Jeet (1948), Bari Bahen (1949), and Dillagi (1949), she became the highest paid film star, earning 1-2\u00a0lakhs of rupees per film, when male actors got much less. When 'Pyar Ki Jeet' was released, it drew large crowds outside Suraiya's house that had to be controlled by posting an inspector and four constables outside her house. During the premiere of 'Badi Behan', there was a very large crowd outside the cinema hall and the police had to lathi-charge when Suraiya was walking into the hall. People even pulled at her clothes, so that after that, Suraiya stopped going to the premieres of her films. But her reign at the very top was till 1952, after which, she reduced her assignments. She made a comeback in Waaris and Mirza Ghalib (film) (1954). Rustom Sohrab (1963) was the last film of her career. In the late 1940s, she worked with Dev Anand. While shooting the film Vidya (1948), she became romantically involved with Dev Anand. The two of them were paired in seven films together: Vidya (1948), Jeet (1949), Shair (1949), Afsar (1950), Nili (1950), Do Sitare (1951) and Sanam (1951), all of which were successful at the box office. In these films, Suraiya was always first-biller in the credits, indicating that she was a bigger star than Dev Anand. She fell in love with him during the shooting of the song Kinare Kinare Chale Jaayenge from the film 'Vidya' in 1948. While shooting the scene in a river, the boat they were in capsized, and Dev Anand saved Suraiya from drowning. From 1948 to 1951, their love affair was the talk of the tinsel world. During the shooting of the film 'Jeet', Dev Anand proposed to her and gave her a diamond ring worth rupees three thousand, a huge sum in those days. Suraiya was glad to be proposed, but soon her grandmother found out about her engagement and threw her ring into the sea. Her maternal grandmother opposed the relationship, mainly because they were Muslims and Dev Anand was a Hindu. Suraiya and Dev Anand were stopped from acting together after her last film with Dev Anand in 1951 by her grandmother. Thereafter, Suraiya remained unmarried by her own choice for the rest of her life. From the late forties to the early fifties, she remained the highest paid, as well as, the most popular star of the Indian cinema Her reign at the top was from 1947 to 1952.Her contract with A. R. Kardar ended with Deewana, after which she reduced her assignments in films. She made national news with Sohrab Modi's film Mirza Ghalib (1954), which won a national award, the President's Gold medal for the Best Feature Film. In the film, she made vivid, the role of the married Ghalib's lover. Along with an emotionally fluid performance where her expressions of love, expectation and hurt just seemed to merge into one another, the queen of cadence also recorded songs, which are still regarded by many as the definitive Ghalib renditions and the standard by which Ghalib's gazal singing is measured. No less a personality than Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru praised her singing and acting by saying, Tumne Mirza Ghalib Ki Rooh Ko Zinda Kar Diya, (You have brought Mirza Ghalib to life). After Mirza Ghalib, she acted in movies like Bilwamangal (1954), Waris (1954), Shama Parwana (1954), Kanchan (1955) (which was released in 1949 as Amar Kahani and re-released as 'Kanchan'), Inam (1955), Mr. Lambu (1956), Trolly Driver (1958), Miss 1958 (1958), Maalik (1958) and Shama (1961). In mid-fifties, Suraiya told Lata once that she would soon be cutting down on her films. Lata told her not to do so. Rustom Sohrab (1963) was her last film. The song, 'Yeh kaisi ajab daastan ho gayi hai' from the film, which was one of her finest songs, was also her last, as with this song Suraiya also said 'adieu' to her singing career, along with her film career. Suraiya in an interview said that during the shooting of the film, she suffered from low blood pressure, which was the reason of her giving up her acting career. As a heroine, Suraiya acted with the following actors as heroes in her films, namely, Prithviraj Kapoor, Raj Kapoor, Shammi Kapoor, Dev Anand, K. L. Sehgal, Ashok Kumar, Ajit, Kamal Kapoor, Rehman, Surendra, Shyam (Chopra), Amar Nath, Karan Dewan, Jairaj, Mukesh, C. H. Atma, Talat Mehmood, Sheikh Mukhtar, Naseer Khan (Dileep Kumar's brother), Vijay Dutt (Guru Dutt's brother), Prem Nath, Bharat Bhushan, Suresh, Wasti, Moti Lal, Jayant, Nusrat. Her film 'Jaanwar' in early nineteen fifties with Dilip Kumar as hero (and K. Asif as director) was left incomplete by her, as she refused to act in the film, because of rough behaviour by Dilip Kumar during the shooting of the film. In 1953, she refused film 'Anarkali' as heroine, a role which went to Bina Rai. Suraiya had a very sweet voice from childhood. She could sing all types of songs with ease, whether sad, with pathos in her voice, or romantic with amorous love, or comic with playful jest. Suraiya was initially, not a classically trained singer in Hindustani music, knowing the 'grammar' or theory of Hindustani music, yet she was a practical singer by nature. She became the most outstanding singing star of her times from 1945 to 1963 and reached dizzying heights during 1947\u20131950 in her popularity as an actress. Suraiya's first song as a child-singer was \"Boot karun main polish babu\" (as a playback singer) in the film Nai Duniya (1942), composed by Naushad. She went on to sing playback for Mehtab for Sharda, Kanoon and Sanjog (1942\u201343) under him, when her principal, Miss P.F. Puttack, took a strong view of her truancy from school, and her \u2018adventure\u2019 came to an abrupt halt. As a singer, Suraiya sang as a playback singer for actress Mehtab in Sharda (1942), Kanoon (1943) and Sanjog (1943), with Naushad as the music director and A R Kardar as director and producer. At first, seeing baby Suraiya, Mehtab was hesitant to have her as her playback singer, but on hearing her, she wanted Suraiya to sing all her songs in her films. Even in later years, in 1946, Mehtab was so attached to Suraiya's singing, that she requested Suraiya to record disc versions of her songs in her film Shama (1946), produced by Sohrab Modi, when Suraiya had become a busy heroine and had left singing playback in films for Mehtab. Suraiya then sang for Mehtab, in her own disc versions, available in YouTube, which were recorded by Shamshad Begum in the film. Suraiya debuted with Manna Dey in his first Hindi film song and their only duet 'Jago ayee usha' in 'Tamanna' in 1942, for which his uncle, famous K. C. Dey was the music director. Again in 1942, Suraiya paired with Rajkumari in 'Station-Master' for the song 'sajan ghar aye'. A few years later, the great singer actor, K.L. Saigal was so impressed by the singing of 16 years old youthful Suraiya, that he readily agreed to have her opposite him in the film 'Tadbir' as a heroine and a singer in 1945. Saigal again opted for Suraiya as his heroine and a singer in films 'Omar Khayyam' (1946) and 'Parwana' (1947). 'Parwana' was Saigal's last film and was released after his death. Later, Suraiya continued to work with music director Naushad in a few films and in 1946, she appeared with actress Noor Jehan in Anmol Ghadi as a co-star and Naushad as the music director. She sang three songs in the film, which became popular, of which 'Man Leta Hai Angdai' went viral throughout the country. Musical film 'Dillagi' (1949), under Kardar's direction, with Naushad's music, became a silver jubilee hit, with Suraiya becoming a national rage with her songs and acting. In a span of 22 years, she gave a number of hits. In her honey-rich voice, songs like \"Woh paas rahain, ya door rahein\", 'Tere naino ne chori kiya', 'Tu mera chaand, main teri chandni', \"Yaad karun tori batiya\" and the rare classical number, 'Man mor hua matwala' created hysteria in the country. Khurshid Anwar was the music director in Suraiya's three films, viz. 'Ishara (1943)', 'Parwana (1947)' and 'Singar (1949)'. Suraiya sang 13 songs in these films. Some outstanding songs of 'Parwana' are \"Jab tumhi nahin apne\", \"Mere munderey na bol\", and \"Papi papiha re\". With music directors duo, Husnlal Bhagatram, Suraiya worked in 11 films and recorded the highest number of songs for any music director from 1948 to 1958. The films were Pyar Ji Jeet (1948), Aaj Ki Raat (1948), Naach (1949), Balam (1949), Bari Behen(1949), Amar Kahani(1949), Sanam (1951), Shama Parwana(1954), Kanchan (1955), Trolley Driver (1955). Her song 'O, door janewale, wada na bhul jana' in 'Pyar Ki Jeet' in 1948 became a hit all over India. Suraiya did only three films with music composer Sachin Dev Burman, viz. Vidya(1948) (with Dev Anand), Afsar (1949) (with Dev Anand) and Lal Kunwar (1952)), as she was associated with other composers and SD Burman came late into the scene in Bombay. Yet, most of their songs are memorable. 'Man mor hua Matwala' (Afsar), 'Nain Dewane' (Afsar), 'Layi khushi ki dunia' (with Mukesh in 'Vidya') and 'Preet sataye teri yaad na'(Lal Kunwar) being some of them. All of Suraiya's songs from her film 'Mirza Ghalib' (1954) (music director: Ghulam Mohammed) have become classical songs and have enhanced the beauty of Ghalib's ghazals for the connoisseur and the layman alike. The songs 'Yeh na thi hamari kismat', 'Nukta- cheen hai gam-e-dil', 'Dil-e-nadan tujhe hua kya hai', 'Aah Ko Chahiye', 'Rahiye ab aisi jagha' are the finest examples of ghazal singing. Another movie of Suraiya, which has evergreen songs, is 'Shama' (1961). The lyrics were written by the stalwart lyricist Kaifi Azmi and the music composer was another 'Great', Ghulam Mohammed. The memorable songs sung by Suraiya are 'Mast aankhon mein shararat', 'Dhadakte Dil Ki Tamanna ho','Aap se pyaar hua jata hai'. Suraiya was the only singing actress, who also worked as a heroine and co-star with many other singing-stars of her times, including Noor Jehan (Anmol Ghadi), C. H. Atma (Bilwamangal), Talat Mahmood (Maalik and Waris), Mukesh (Mashuqa), K.L. Saigal (Tadbeer, Omar Khaiyyam and Parwana) and Surendra (1857 and Anmol Ghadi). Her last film as a singing actress was Rustom Sohrab, with the song \"Yeh kaisi ajab dastan ho gayi hai\", being her last, yet one of the most remembered songs. Suraiya was recognized as the first Melody Queen of the sub - continent and was the first singer to be given the honorific \"Malika-e-Tarannum\" (Melody Queen) for her singing talent before partition, ahead of any other singer. Suraiya could sing in all octaves, though she mostly sang her songs in lower octaves, as many of them were 'ghazals' and 'geets'. An example of her higher octave song is from the film 'Tadbir' (1945), viz. 'Jaag Ae Sonewale', with music by Lal Mohammad, who composed music in just four films, but was masterly in each one of them. Suraiya's songs, as a tribute to her, are played every year on her death anniversary on 31 January by Radio Sri Lanka (Hindi music) and are recorded on YouTube by eraksoldies. In the late 1940s and early 50s, craze for Suraiya amongst her fans was at its peak. Her house at Marine Drive was always mobbed by her fans and suitors, when her car used to come out or enter the gates. Most of the fans were obsessed with her. \"She was a screen goddess and a mellifluous singer, who had the world at her feet.\"(Tribune). Even one of them (actress Veena's brother) went on a fast outside her house, so that she would acquisce and marry him. Another crazy fan came with a 'barat'(wedding party) and dowry from Lahore, and yet another, kept a photograph of hers in the 'Puja' (temple at home) and would not eat without worshipping her. Even street singers would make money singing songs fom her film 'Pyar ki Jeet'. At the other extreme, even Kanti Desai, son of the Chief Minister, Bombay State, Morarji Desai (later Prime Minister of India), invited her to a private party, but she refused politely. It is said that Kanti Desai tried hard, even threatening her, but to no consequence. Actor Dharmendra was a great fan of Suraiya. He is said to have seen her film 'Dillagi' (1949) forty times in his teens, walking miles from his hometown, Sahnewal in Punjab, to watch her movies. Suraiya was known for her glamour, dresses and jewellery in films like ' Mirza Ghalib', 'Pyar Ki Jeet', 'Dillagi', 'Sanam', 'Dastan', 'Diwana' and 'Shama Parwana', while many of her films had simple, non-glamourous roles. In real life, Suraiya was known for her love for ethnic dresses and jewellery. At functions, she wore her jewellery to her maximum advantage and wore make-up. She kept her image of actress Suraiya alive in her viewers mind till her later life.  Journalist Suresh Kohli reported in 'Deccan Herald' in 2011, that during the 1977 Filmfare Awards function, hush descended on the scene, when heavily be-jewelled Suraiya, dressed in green brocade saree and sporting a 'bindi' and escorted by Filmfare editor B.K.Karanjia, walked towards Dev Anand, her favourite hero, former lover, marriage proposer and friend, whom she could not marry, under pressure. Suraiya was an ardent fan of the Hollywood star Gregory Peck, who paid her a surprise visit with actor, Al Nasir at mid-night from Hotel Ambassador near her home on January 5, 1954. Gregory Peck had come to Bombay for delivering the first Filmfare Awards, but was late because of flight delay from Ceylon. In 1952, Suraiya had given Frank Capra, a signed photograph of hers to be delivered to her idol, Gregory Peck, when Capra came to India for 20 days to attend the International Film Festival. Gregory Peck told Suraiya that \"he found my photograph which I sent him through Mr. Capra so beautiful that he had it on the wall of his bedroom! He did, and he actually asked me to act with him in a picture.\" In the late 1940s, Dev Anand used to enact Gregory Peck's mannerisms to please Suraiya, as she was a fan of Gregory Peck and she often expressed this to Dev Anand. Their love-affair continued for four years from 1948 to 1951. Dev Anand nick-named Suraiya \"Nosey\", while to Suraiya Dev Anand was \"Steve\", a name chosen from a book Dev Anand had given her. Suraiya also called Dev Anand \"Devina\" and Dev Anand called Suraiya \"Suraiyana\", while faking Italian accent. (Later on Dev Anand named his daughter 'Devina' as told to Suraiya, 'Star & Style', February, 1987). Suraiya was so much in love with Dev Anand that she let Lata sing some of the songs picturized on her in her films, in order to get more time to be with Dev Anand. Her love for Dev Anand was so intense, that she was ready to forgo her singing star career for Dev, who was even more passionate about her. \"All I could then think of was my love for Dev - Suraiya as a singing star and her career be damned!\"(in 'A Journey Down Memory Lane' by Raju Bharatan). During the shooting of director Rana Pratap's film 'Jeet', both Dev Anand and Suraiya, with the help of the film members, namely Durga Khote (actress), Dwarka Divecha (cinematographer) and others, had made plans for marriage in a temple, and elopement, but at the last minute, an assistant director, jealous of their marriage, informed Suraiya's grandmother, who dragged her home from the scene. Speaking to journalist Sheila Vesuna, Suraiya said, \"Eventually, my grandmother succeeded in separating us. Dev was deeply hurt and offended by my lack of courage. But I was afraid for him. In retrospect, I don't think anything would have happened if I'd been bold enough. But I was terrified of my grandmother. And was heartbroken. But time is the greatest healer.\" Suraiya's grandmother, Badshah Begum, who controlled the family, was fiercely opposed to Suraiya marrying Dev Anand. She was also supported by Suraiya's maternal uncle, Zahoor and some film persons, viz. composer Naushad, director-producer AR Kardar, lyricist Naqshab (Nadira's first husband) and director M. Sadiq. During the shooting of Dev Anand's own production 'Afsar' (1950), under the banner of 'Navketan', Suraiya's grandmother started to oppose their romance openly and started interfering even in the shooting of their love scenes. Kamini Kaushal, who worked with Suraiya and Dev Anand in 'Shair' (1949), said in an interview to Filmfare in January 2014, that Suraiya would pass on her letters to her be delivered to Dev Anand, when her grandmother started keeping an eye on their love-affair. She said that Dev Anand was non-aggressive, not someone to put his foot down and say, \"I'll marry her\". Dev Anand in a TV interview with Simi, \"Rendezvous with Simi Garewal\", after Suraiya's death in January 2004, revealed that Suraiya, who had gladly accepted his ring first, never told him the reason for her later refusal of the marriage proposal, and that she was coerced to say \"no\" to him by her grandmother. In an interview with 'Stardust', June 1972, Suraiya revealed that she lacked courage to resist her family and that Dev Anand truly loved her. \"When I refused to marry Dev Anand, he called me a coward. Maybe I was one. I admit I didn't have the courage to take a step I was not absolutely sure of. Perhaps, it was a folly, perhaps a mistake, or perhaps destiny\". Dev Anand in the interview with Simi, said that after she had said \"no\" to him, much later, she probably regretted it. But, by then, he had gone much ahead. The principal reason of opposition by the grandmother and her advisers was that Dev Anand was of a different religion and the covert one was that Suraiya was the only earning member of the family. Naqshab, even brought a copy of Koran to make her swear that she would not marry Dev Anand (February 1987, 'Star and Style' interview of both Dev Anand and Suraiya by Sheila Vesuna). The film people had also their own professional and personal interests in opposing an early marriage of their popular singing star. Rather, M. Sadiq, who was a married man, himself wanted to marry her. Suraiya's parents wanted her to marry Dev Anand, but being a mellow couple, their voice was ignored by the grandmother. In the 'Star and Style' interview, Suraiya said that she gave in only when both her grandmother and her maternal uncle threatened to get Dev Anand killed. Suraiya told during this interview, that during the shooting of the film 'Neeli', when she told Dev Anand that she did not want her to be the cause of his death, he slapped her across the face and called her a \"coward\". She did not mind Dev Anand slapping her, because she knew how much he loved her. Dev Anand later kept on apologising for days about his behaviour. The painful dalliance with Dev Anand, left her bruised emotionally, a phase from which many said she never recovered. A retreat from the public atmosphere was followed by a return in films like Mirza Ghalib (1954) for which she received praise even from the Prime Minister, Jawahar Lal Nehru, but she never attained the dizzy public popularity she had attained earlier on. Suraiya refused to marry anyone in future, in spite of efforts by her family to persuade her to marry certain film directors and businessmen of their community. M. Sadiq, film director, actor Rehman were some of the film persons who were interested in marrying Suraiya. Dev Anand who was very depressed on her reluctant refusal to marry him, and was counselled by his brother Chetan Anand to recover and stand up from the break up, went on to marry Kalpana Kartik after four years in 1954 in a hurried simple marriage, but as he said in his auto-biography, Suraiya was his first true love. Elsewhere, he has said to Shekhar Hattangadi that in spite of his marriage to Kalpana Kartik after his failed love affair that \"Suraiya was the love and passion of his life and that I will always cherish her memory\". While Suraiya was alive in October 2003, Dev Anand accepted the fact that \"Suraiya was my first and only real love. I wanted to marry her and she was willing. But her Muslim family objected to my being a Hindu, and created a big row over the communal issue. Remember, she was already a big singing star when we first met, and I was a nobody. Fans mobbed her, her songs were on the air, and her star image added to the attraction.\" In an interview to A Ganesh Nadar of rediff.com, reminiscing about Suraiya in his autobiography, Dev Anand said, \"The book would not be honest without mentioning her. Parting with her was painful. I met her for the last time on the terrace of her building in Marine Drive (in south Mumbai). That was the saddest day of my life.\" Suraiya and Dev Anand later did meet on a few occasions in parties as friends in Mumbai in their lifetime. Suraiya gave up her professional career as an actress and singer in 1963, and even later on refused to sing for music directors, like Naushad and for music companies like HMV and Polydor, despite several requests by them. She went on to live life away from media glare and public eye thereafter, except appearing on a very few public occasions, like during Noor Jehans visit to India in 1982. She did give a few interviews for magazines and some media people from India and Pakistan in the 1970s and 80s. Only later in life in the 1990s and thereafter, she accepted awards and mementos and appeared on a few public occasions. Suraiya's maternal grandmother, Badshah Begum, who played a major part in her career and even personal life, later went to Pakistan to live with her brother, and she was left alone with her mother, Mumtaz Begum. The time with her mother were her happy years, when her mother took care of her daily needs and she would occasionally go to her film world friends. She had a few friends like old timer Jairaj, Nimmi, Nirupa Roy and Tabassum, whom she met once in while. After her mother's death in 1987, Suraiya started feeling lonely in her rented apartment (owned by Aswin Shah) in Krishna Mahal, Marine Drive in Mumbai, where she lived from the early 1940s until her death in 2004 at the age of 74. She possessed several apartments in Worli and a house and orchard in Lonavala. Suraiya met Asha Bhonsle on 10 December 1993 at Raju Bharatan daughter Shilpa's wedding reception at Bombay's Vile Parle, where Raju Bharatan asked Suraiya in a chat along with Asha, whether the two had sung a song together, to which Suraiya said, \"regrettably no\", forgetting that the two had sung a duet together in 1954 in 'Shama Parwana', titled 'jake lage naina, wo paiye nahi chaina'. Tabassum, who worked with Suraiya in 'Bari Behan' and 'Moti Mahal' as her younger sister, met her often at her home, or rang Suraiya from her home. During Suraiya's last few months of her life, Tabassum said \"It's sad that she had shut her doors to the world in her last days. Sometimes when I visited her, I\u2019d find papers and milk collected at her door. She never opened the door. But she\u2019d talk comfortably with me on the phone. I remember our last conversation. I asked her, \"Aapa kaisi hain?\"(Elder sister, how are you?\") She replied in verse, \"Kaisi guzar rahi hai sabhi poochte hai mujhse, kaise guzaarti hoon koi nahin poochta.\"( \"Everbody asks me, how are you, but nobody asks me, how I spend my days and nights\".)(As told to Farhana Farook in 2012)\" She died on 31 January 2004 aged 74, after being hospitalized for a few days. In her last six months, she was taken care of by her neighbour and family friends, Dhimant Thakar's family, with whom she stayed during this period. She was very close to the two daughters (Amee and Camy) of Dhimant Thakar. She was admitted for a brief period for hypoglacemia, ischemia and insulinoma to Harkshandas hospital in South Mumbai by Thakars'. In the hospital, actor Sunil Dutt, music director, Naushad and Pratap A. Rana, writer-producer of her films, \"Jeet\" and \"Vidya\", visited her during this period. She died at 9.25\u00a0am on 31 January 2004. Actor Dharmendra, who was her ardent fan, also attended her funeral. She was buried at Badakabarastan in Marine Lines, Mumbai. After her death, Suraiya's property at Worli and her house at Krishna Mahal, where she lived on rent for over 70 years at Marine Drive, went into legal dispute, as she did not leave behind an explicit will. While the house at Krishna Mahal was claimed by her her adopted family (and lawyer) and her cousin, Mehfooz Ahmed (maternal uncle M. Zahoor's son) in Dubai, her property was claimed by the adopted family of her lawyer (based on his daughter being a nominee in Suraiya's papers and gift to her as 'hiba'), and her cousin. In 2006, Mumbai High Court, granted Mehfooz Ahmed, born in Lahore in 1943 and staying in Dubai, the right to administer Suraiya's estate, as she died without a will. In 2008, her cousin who never met her for over 40 years before her death, got the right to the rented house at Krishna Mahal, valued at 7.5 crores rupees, as a tenant by the High Court judgement (according to Mumbai's old rent control laws) over her family lawyer. The house owner Ashwin Shah did not contest the case. The cousin had no objection to the house being sold. In 1948, Suraiya was awarded a gold medal by the noted theatre personality, Adi Pherozeshah Marzban, for her role in Kajal(film), in which she acted as a sixteen year old to a sixty-year-old woman. In the 4 April 1952 issue of the newly launched film magazine 'Filmfare', Suraiya's coloured photograph appeared on the front-cover of the during the first year, second month of its publication, the first issue of which came out in March 1952. Suraiya featured regularly in 'Lux' soap campaigns in magazines and 'Lux' calendars in the 1950s. In 1955, Mirza Ghalib (film), a film in which Suraiya acted, was awarded the President's Gold Medal for the Best Feature Film of 1954 (first Hindi film) during the 2nd National Film Awards and her acting and singing was highly appreciated and extolled by the then Prime Minister, Jawahar Lal Nehru at Rastrapati Bhawan, during the special screening of the movie, which Suraiya said was bigger than an Oscar. In 1994, a retrospective of Suraiya's films was held at Mumbai by the 'Cine Club' during 21\u201326 March 1994, which was inaugurated by the then Cabinet Minister of Maharashtra, Vilas Rao Deshmukh (later Chief Minister of Maharashtra), in Suraiya's presence, wherein she gave an introductory talk about her films and the prevailing trends in Bollywood films. This event is recorded in YouTube as 'Suraiya-Khusboo ka Safar' in four parts. In 1996, Suraiya was awarded the Screen Lifetime Achievement Award, presented to her by the actor-politician Sunil Dutt. Dressed in a splendid white salwar kameez, Suraiya was overwhelmed with emotion on the occasion, and said in her ever sweet voice that she had had a long association with the film industry. She was deeply moved to note that the people continued to remember her after so many years. When the anchor-actor, Javed Jafri asked her to sing a few lines of any of her songs, she refused. Indian Express reported, \"As a star, she still remembers the meaning of letting a legend live. Heroines are captured forever on the silver screen and the public memory must never be updated.\" In December, 1998, she was especially honoured for perpetuating Mirza Ghalib's memory by her acting and songs by the then Prime Minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee during Mirza Ghalib celebrations in New Delhi conducted by the Urdu Academy and Sahitya Academy. In 1999, she was honoured with the Bimal Roy Memorial Trophy, instituted by the Bimal Roy Memorial and Film Society, Mumbai. In 1999, Suraiya was specially invited as the Chief Guest to present the Zee Cine Lifetime Acievement Award to Lata Mangeshkar, the event being conducted by Amin Sayani. On April 30, 2003, Suraiya, \"the unforgettable diva of yesteryears\", as described by the Times of India, was honoured by the Dadasaheb Phalke Academy and Screen World Publication at a special function on the 134th birth anniversary of Dada Phalke, the occasion was chaired by the Cultural Minister of Maharashtra, Ashok Chavan. The Times of India reported, \"Dressed in crimson red zardosi churidar with sparkling long dangling earrings, the singing rage of the 40's, Suraiya received a standing ovation as she went on the dais to receive a small token of appreciation from the Dadasaheb Phalke Academy and Screen World Publication, organisers of the show\". On 3 May 2013, a postage stamp, bearing her image in various roles, was released by the India Post owned by the Government of India to honour her on the occasion of the '100 Years of Indian Cinema'. In 2013, in a poll conducted by the ethnic Indian brand Seven East, in association with the International Indian Film Academy, as part of the 100 years of Indian Cinema, Suraiya was voted as the \"Best On Screen Beauty with the Most Ethnic Look\", followed by film Indian actresses Mumtaz, Waheeda Rehman, Madhubala, Meena Kumari, Sharmila Tagore and Hema Malini. Amin Sayani, renowned radio and TV anchor and music historian selected Suraiya song 'Wo pas rahe ya door rahe' from film 'Badi Behan', as one of the top songs among the 12 songs during the period 1949-1953. In 1954, Suraiya's duet 'Rahi Matwale' from the film 'Waris' with Talat Mehmood was selcted the 5th top songs of the year, chosen by listeners in 'Binaca Geet Mala' on Radio Ceylon. A building in which Suraiya owned flats in Worli, Mumbai is named 'Suraiya Apartments' and a road in Nagargaon, Lonavala, District Pune, where she had some property is named 'Suraiya Road' after her. Even now, in India, jewellery is sold by Suraiya's name by many online companies, because of styles popularized by her in her films and by her adornments, like 'Suraiya' earrings. Speaking about Suraiya, Dev Anand said in an interview, \"Suraiya and I fell in love when we started working together. She was a very nice girl who radiated warmth and friendliness. She was an established star but had no airs about her. I was passionately in love with her. I was young, It was my first love and very intense.\"  Suraiya continued to be so mesmerized by Dev Anand's memories and her love for him, that in a much later interview with Raju Bharatan, she always kept referring to him as \"my Dev', when talking about Dev Anand and her aborted love-affair (aborted by her granny, AR Kardar (producer-director) and Naushad (music-director)). \"I should have stood up to my granny, then and there. Gone ahead and wed my Dev. But, I was too much under Granny's thumb and the moment was gone. What hurt like hell was their \"Woh Hindu hai\" (\"He is a Hindu\") line on which they based their opposition. I owe so much to Kardar and Naushad (for her professional life), but I will never forgive them for the one-track outlook they adopted in creating hurdle after hurdle for me in the purely personal matter of my marrying my Dev\".\" Suraiya had a calm temperament and never showed any bitterness or rancour that is often found in people who have tasted the fruits of success and have to move on. On the contrary, there was a sense of relief from having escaped from the applause, bright lights and camera.(Interview to 'Society Magazine' in January,1982.)  Suraiya never boasted of her singing and acting ability, in spite of her immense popularity in her times. About her singing, she remarked to Raju Bharatan in his book 'Lata Mangeshkar- a Biography', \"Noorjehan was born great, Lata achieved greatness, I had singing greatness thrust upon me\". The centre of attraction of Suraiya's beauty were her large expressive eyes, which were so magnetic that songs were written about her eyes. A song which was sung by her in 'Pyar ki jeet' (1948) on the eyes, 'tere naino ne chori kiya', where her eyes were shown to advantage on screen, catapulted her to be the reigning superstar of her times, fetching her rupees one and a half lakh per film, the highest in those times, when heroes were getting less than one lakh rupees. Suraiya was friendly with elderly journalist, B.K. Karanjia, editor of Filmfare and Screen. She stood by him when a section of the movie industry did not support his hosting 'Constellation Nite', for a charitable cause (scarcity in the State) for a technical reason. The event was held on 10 May 1953 at the Lloyd's Reclamation Grounds at Marine Drive. When she went on stage to sing a song from the film 'Pagalkhana' with Vasant Desai wielding the baton, Dilip Kumar was so moved at the end, that he went on stage to garland her on the stage, which brought the whole house down.( 'Counting my Blessings' by B.K. Karanjia.) During her 28 years long career, Suraiya worked with several actors and actresses. During her interviews, she described the qualities of her co-stars in great detail. She worked with Prithviraj Kapoor in 'Ishara' in 1943, when she was only thirteen and Prithviraj Kapoor was in his mid forties. He encouraged her as his heroine, in spite of the age difference. She said that she respected him very much and the respect increased with years. Suraiya described Raj Kapoor as a \"bombshell\" on the sets and predicted in 1952 that he would make a great producer-director in future, as he was very imaginative. Suraiya worked with K.L. Saigal in three films during 1945 and 1946, when she was 15\u201316 years old. To her working with Saigal was a great honour and a privilege, as he was the king of romance and singing at that time. She was the heroine of actor Shyam and worked with him in three films, viz 'Dillagi', 'Nach' and 'Char Din', before he died suddenly of a fall from a horse on the sets in 1951. She said that she often thought of him as the Errol Flynn of India, as he was a merry person, jocular and talkative. Suraiya confided that Shyam was quite close to her family and even often teased her granny. Ashok Kumar with whom Suraiya worked in one film, 'Khiladi' (1950), was very humorous on the sets, although he appeared to be a serious person. To her, Ashok Kumar matured much as a polished actor after 'Mahal' (1949). Ajit, her hero in 'Moti Mahal' appeared to be a shy person to her at first, although to his fans, he was a \"tough\" guy. He did not mind people saying anything about him. He was nicknamed \"John Hal\" on the sets. Her hero of several films Rehman was a \"thinking actor\", who often played chess with her, a game she did not like much. He was generally serious, but could be witty at times with his jokes, which he wanted others to listen to. Jairaj, actor and hero in many of her films, had been known to her since her childhood. She knew him as a very generous and straightforward person, who was taken advantage of by many persons. He too was often a guest at her home on Sundays for lunch. Nasir Khan, younger brother of Dilip Kumar, acted in 'Lal Kunwar' (1952) could do well under a good director. He was much interested in puzzles and often asked puzzles on the sets from his co-aristes. Suraiya acted with Motilal as his heroine in three films, 'Do Dil', 'Aaj Ki Raat' and 'Lekh'. Motilal made a perfect lover on the sets, as he was a 'natural actor'. Mukesh acted in 'Mashuka' (1953) with her and was self-conscious on the sets at first and Suraiya had to guide her at first. Suraiya said that she had known Surendra since her childhood when he was already a grown-up person. She acted in two films with Surendra, viz. 'Anmol Ghadi' (1946) and '1857' (1946). Surendra once told her, when she was acting as a heroine opposite him, that he had saved her as a child from a car on the road when she was a toddler. According to Suraiya, Dev Anand was a debonair, handsome actor, who acted in the maximum number of films (seven) with her. Although, Dev Anand believed himself to be a \"tough\" guy, he actually was not. He had a habit of pulling Suraiya's hair between takes. He could play all types of roles, but hated singing roles. His greeting \"hello\" to all, while entering the sets, was known to everyone. Suraiya spoke highly of Noor Jehan, a few years her senior in acting, in an interview to 'Times of India' newspaper on 25 December 2000. \"Noor Jehan was my ideal. Noor Jehan was the most affectionate person, an ideal mother and a top class career woman. She was one of the greatest singer actresses the world has ever seen and the film industry has yet to produce another like her. I was only 14 years when I acted with Noor Jehan and was not a trained singer. But both Noor Jehan and Naushad encouraged me to sing in the film \"Anmol Ghadi\", I got a small role in the film but got noticed because of her. The film was a big hit and celebrated diamond jubilee in Novelty Cinema. It was a great experience with Noor Jehan, as she was friendly, witty and used to crack jokes and also used to give me tips for make up. She was like my sister, a great mother and a fighter who carried on with her career despite being a single mother\". On her death on 31 January 2004, the then Prime Minister of India, Atal Behari Vajpayee in a condolence message said Suraiya was \"not only a good actress but a talented singer\" and \"the legendary singer was endowed with a mellifluous voice\". Information and Broadcasting Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Suraiya was \"one of the most popular singing superstars of the forties and her famous honey voice and rich songs will remain popular for all times to come. Her contribution to the development of the Indian cinema will be remembered for long\". O.P. Dutta, director-writer, the only living director (when she died) to have worked with her in \"Pyar Ki Jeet\" remembered her as \"a lonely heart and a bundle of unforgettable qualities\".\"Suraiya, Bano to me, was a bundle of unforgettable qualities. A sublime voice, the ring in the voice, the perfect diction, the effortless rendering. But she always insisted that she was no singer.\" \"There were congratulations all around (on her success in his film). But Suraiya insisted she was no great shakes as an actress. The argument was over when she gave a sterling performance in 'Bari Bahen'. The success made Suraiya smile that unforgettable smile that could send a thousand hearts aflutter. She was right at the top and I was very happy for her.\" Dilip Kumar, veteran actor, said on her passing away, \"She was a caring girl, very affectionate, particularly with junior artistes,\". \"Suraiya will be sorely missed, even though she had been a recluse for decades.\" Dev Anand said on her death, \"I felt sad when she died. One does feel sad at death. I did not go to her funeral because I would have been reminded of her past. I cried from a distance.\". In an interview with Simi Grewal in her show, 'Rendezvous with Simi Grewal', Dev Anand paid his ultimate tribute to Suraiya, speaking poignantly about their failed love affair and Suraiya's loneliness in life. He said \"in her death, maybe she was relieved of her sorrows in life\". Lata Mangeshkar, Suraiya's co-singer in her films 'Balam', 'Sanam' and 'Diwana', narrated to Subash K. Jha of 'The Times of India' newspaper, \"My eyes mist over when I remember Suraiyaji's stardom. Oh-ho-ho ho! 'Kya naam tha unka'! ('How popular was she!'). I used to just gaze at her long sleek car ('Cadillac'). I remembered her car's number by heart. 'Humlog sochte thay kitne bade artiste hain'! ('We would feel in awe, how big an artiste was she!'). People say Suraiyaji's death is a big loss to the film industry. But who went to see her when she was alive?\" Singer Nitin Mukesh said Suraiya had played heroine opposite his father, playback legend Mukesh, in the movie, 'Mashooka' (1953), as the lead actor.\u2018\u2018Papa was very fond of her. She met me at a couple of award functions and was always affectionate.\u2019\u2019 Jaya Bhaduri, actress and wife of actor Amitabh Bachan, poignantly remembered Suraiya in 2004 just after her death, while receiving \"Sansui Lifetime Achievement Award\", saying that more tributes should have come her way, on how big an artiste she was. Earlier, in 1974, Sulakshana Pandit, then an upcoming actress cum singer, in an interview to Hindi film magazine 'Mayapuri' said \"I want to to be a heroine cum singer like Suraiya. Her voice was fabulous, and she sang her own songs for films. I want to do the same.\"  Editor of the film weekly, 'Screen (magazine)', Rauf Ahmed, remembered her, \"She was the uncrowned queen of her time, a dazzling singing star. She took off from where Noor Jehan left when she went to Pakistan. When Suraiya acted with Dev Anand and Raj Kapoor, she was bigger than all of them\".\"...(For the Screen Videocon Lifetime Achievement Award (1996)), it was difficult to bring Suraiya to the Screen Awards ceremony. Till the last moment, we didn\u2019t know if she would arrive to collect the award,\" he said. The Outlook (magazine) wrote after her death: \"She evoked the kind of hysteria [in the late 1940s] that can be compared only with Rajesh Khanna in his heyday from 1969 to 1972. Ask any old-timer and they would confirm that people bunked offices, schools and colleges, even shops closed on the opening day of her films, to see her films first day, first show.\" The Hindu newspaper wrote about Suraiya, \"What can you say about a lady, who was courted by Dev Anand, respected by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, but feared by Lata Mangeshkar! That she was beautiful, talented, adored by millions, but died a lonely single woman? Or, that she was the best ever superstar singer-actress of Indian films, yet walked away to a self-imposed exile at the height of her glory? Yes, Suraiya was all this, plus \"a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma\" who resolutely shunned screen and media once she departed from the arc lights.\" Suraiya's songs, as a tribute to her, are played every year on her death anniversary on 31 January by Radio Sri Lanka (Hindi music) (formerly Radio Ceylon) and are recorded on YouTube by eraksoldies.

(1) 'Rendezvouz with Simi Garewal Dev Anand Part-1' The TV interview of Dev Anand was conducted by Simi Garewal after Suraiya's death in 2004. Dev Anand comes out about their love-affair in quite a detailed way, and how he felt for Suraiya till her end. He said he did not go to meet her in her last days in the hospital, because he did not want to make a show of his sorrows. \"Your sorrows are the citadels of your loneliness, not to be shared with the world\", he said. (2) Dev Anand remembered Suraiya in an interview with Karan Thapar in 'Face to Face' for BBC in 2002. He said, he was in totally in love with Suraiya. His affair with Suraiya refined him and made a man out of him. About the question on eloping with Suraiya, he said he did not favour elopement. If he had married, it would have been with consent of her family. (3) In, possibly, his last interview on his birthday on 26 September 2011, Dev Anand said, if he cried for any girl in his life, it was Suraiya. Suraiya acted in the following films, along with singing her own songs in most of them. Three of Suraiya's films were left incomplete. 'Jaanwar' with Dilip Kumar (early 50s) was abandoned by Suraiya, owing to misbehaviour with her by the lead actor, Dilip Kumar and producer director, K. Asif. 'Pagalkhana' (also, in early 50s), with Bharat Bhushan as lead actor, was abandoned by the producer director P.L. Santoshi after eight reels, because of financial constraints. An English version of 'Wajid Ali Shah', starring Suraiya and Ashok Kumar in 1953, being filmed by British film director, Herbert Marshall, was shelved after being made for some time.

She has won the National Film Award for Best Actress twice, and has received six Filmfare Awards, including a record four Critics Awards for Best Actress.

Her international projects include a leading role in Mira Nair's drama The Namesake (2007) and a supporting role in Ang Lee's highly successful adventure film Life of Pi (2012).

Her first role as an actress was in the Telugu film Coolie No.1 co-starred with Venkatesh. In December 1987, Boney Kapoor launch two Big Films, Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja and Prem. In Prem, Tabu was signed opposite Sanjay Kapoor. The film took eight years in making and it was the biggest flop in Boney Kapoor's production career.[citation needed]Fortunately Tabu's career took off well after this film in spite of the long delay. Tabu's first release in Hindi as a leading lady was Pehla Pehla Pyar which went un-noticed. She came into prominence with her role in Vijaypath (1994) opposite Ajay Devgan for which she received the Filmfare Best Female Debut Award. This was followed by many films that did not do well at the box office. In 1996, Tabu had eight releases. Two films Saajan Chale Sasural and Jeet went on to be hits; both were within the top five films of that year. Her other significant film, Maachis, was critically acclaimed. Her role as a Punjabi woman caught in the rise of Sikh insurgency was acclaimed; she went on to win her first National Film Award for Best Actress for her performance. The same year saw her major blockbuster films down south. Critically acclaimed Malayalam period epic film Kalapani directed by Priyadarshan with Mohanlal and Prabhu Ganesan in the lead roles, brought her laurels for her acting from all across South India. She also debuted in Kollywood through the highly successful Tamil film Kadhal Desam directed by Kathir with Abbas and Vineeth. Tabu's first release of 1997 was Border. The movie was about the real life events surrounding the Battle of Longewala during the 1971 Indo-Pak war. She played the role of Sunny Deol's wife.

In 2000, the actress starred in Hera Pheri and Astitva. The former was a box office success whilst the latter was critically acclaimed. Hindustan Times critic Arnab Banerjee wrote of her performance, \"Tabu is brilliant and once again proves her mettle as an actress. The mind-blowing range of emotions she displays, her exquisite face and her subtle quiet dignity with which she handles her character, will take her far in her film career.\" She received her third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance for Astitva. Down south, Tabu had two releases in Tamil, namely, Kandukondain Kandukondain, a multi-starrer blockbuster film directed by Rajeev Menon and Snegithiye directed by Priyadarshan,along with a Malayalam release Cover Story. Original Malayalam version of Snegithiye which is Raakilipattu was later released in 2007. 2001 saw her star in Chandni Bar directed by Madhur Bhandarkar. Her portrayal of a bar dancer met with unanimous praise, and she won her second National Film Award for Best Actress for her performance. Critic, Taran Adarsh said, \"Chandni Bar is Tabu's film all the way and there are no two opinions on that. Her performance deserves the highest marks and of course, all the awards. Her work is flawless and the impact her character makes on the minds of the viewer is also due to a tailor-made role\". Another critic mentioned, \"if there is one actress who can carry a film on her shoulders, it is Tabu. As usual, she sparkles\". She has acted in a number of Telugu movies, many of them very successful, such as Coolie No. 1 and Ninne Pelladutha, the latter being one of her most famous and popular movies. She further continued to star in films such as Chennakeshava Reddy and Pandurangadu with Nandamuri Balakrishna, Andarivadu with Chiranjeevi and Aavida Maa Aavide with Akkineni Nagarjuna. Tabu made a reentry into Telugu movies after a long hiatus with the film Pandurangudu in 2008. At this time, she was 38 years old. Her roles in Telugu movies largely focused on glamorous roles. In 2003, Tabu starred in an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Macbeth. The actress played Nimmi based on the character Lady Macbeth. The film titled Maqbool was directed by Vishal Bhardwaj and premiered at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival. Maqbool was a box office failure but was met with huge acclaim. Tabu's performance opened to much appreciation; critic Ron Ahluwalia said, \"Tabu shines in a dark role. The most versatile actress in Bollywood takes to villainy like a second nature. She is menacing and seductive, but keeps an innocent look on her face, making her even viler. The way Tabu delivers her taunts simply perfect. Her gradual insanity is heart-wrenching and her final outburst is easily the highlight of the film.\" Another critic said, \"Tabu is fantastic in a complex role. Her performance in the film is worthy of awards. After Chandni Bar, this is another role that will be remembered for a long, long time.\" She had a supporting role in Fanaa (2006), with Aamir Khan and Kajol. The film went on to become the fourth biggest hit of that year. In 2007, Tabu starred in her first Hollywood film, The Namesake, directed by Mira Nair. The film was a big hit overseas. She also starred in Cheeni Kum in which she played a 34-year-old woman who falls in love with a 64-year-old played by Amitabh Bachchan. Critics were generally positive towards the film; Taran Adarsh said, \"Tabu stands on her feet despite a formidable co-star's domineering presence. She's excellent.\" Though the film did not do as well domestically, it performed well overseas, especially in UK and US. She started off 2009 by being featured on the cover of Vogue India's January 2009 issue. In 2010, Tabu portrayed the lead role in the romantic comedy film Toh Baat Pakki!, which earned huge publicity as it marked Tabu's return to Bollywood after three years. However, the film was a commercial failure. Her next release of the year was Khuda Kasam opposite Sunny Deol. Her other film Banda Yeh Bindaas Hai directed by B. R. Chopra got indefinitely shelved owing to the plagiarism issues. She made a comeback to Malayalam cinema in 2011 with her brief song appearance in the multi starrer film, Urumi, directed by Santosh Sivan. The song \"Aaranne Aaranne\" featuring Tabu alongside Prabhu Deva and Prithviraj Sukumaran was declared a chartbuster of the year. In 2012, she featured in her second Hollywood film, Life of Pi, directed by Ang Lee. She played a supporting role as the mother of the protagonist. Her next and only release in 2013 was David, a Tamil \u2013 Hindi bilingual film, starring Vikram in the lead and directed by Bejoy Nambiar. The year 2014 saw her comeback to mainstream commercial cinema with Salman Khan starrer Jai Ho, a remake of Telugu film Stalin, playing the elder sister role to Khan. The film evoked mixed response and was a failure at the box-office. Following this, she teamed up with her Maqbool director Vishal Bhardwaj for his adaptation film of Shakespeare's Hamlet titled as Haider. In this, she played the mother role to Shahid Kapoor's character and her performance was critically acclaimed. Her next venture saw her teaming up with actor Ajay Devgn after a gap of 14 years. She paired opposite him in Nishikant Kamat's murder-mystery film Drishyam which was a remake of the successful Malayalam film with the same title. Her performance of a strict police officer investigating her son's murder case received rave reviews and unanimous praise. This was followed by a cameo appearance in Meghna Gulzar's directorial Talvar. Her forthcoming projects include Abhishek Kapoor's next directorial Fitoor opposite Aditya Roy Kapoor and Katrina Kaif. She also has a psychological thriller film titled Missing, produced by actor Manoj Bajpai. In 1998, Tabu was charged with poaching two blackbuck in Kankani during the filming of Hum Saath Saath Hain along with co-stars Salman Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre and Neelam Kothari. A lower court charged her with the others under the Wildlife Act and the IPC. She had filed a revision petition before a sessions court which discharged her of Section 51 (causing harm to wildlife) of Wildlife Act and both of 147 (punishment for rioting) and 149 (unlawful assembly of persons) of the Indian Penal Code. The Rajasthan state government then filed a revision petition before the Rajasthan high court which again added Section 149 against her, which it had dropped. In December 2012, the Jodhpur court summoned her along with all the accused for commencement of the trial with the revised charges on 4 February 2013. Tabu has been the recipient of two National Film Award for Best Actress for her roles in Maachis (1996) and Chandni Bar (2001). She has also won six Filmfare Awards, four for Critics Award for Best Actress for Virasat (1997), Hu Tu Tu (1999), Astitva (2000) and Cheeni Kum (2007) and one each for Best Female Debut for Vijaypath (1994) and Best Supporting Actress for Haider (2014), and one Filmfare Awards South for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Telugu."

        "biography": " Tanuja Mukherjee (born Tanuja Samarth; 23 September 1943), popularly known as Tanuja, is an Indian film actress, who predominantly works in the Hindi film industry. Part of the Mukherjee-Samarth family, she is the daughter of Shobana and Kumarsen, and was married to Shomu Mukherjee, with whom she has two daughters, actresses, Kajol and Tanisha. A recipient of two Filmfare Awards, Tanuja is best known for her roles in the Hindi films, Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi (1966), Jewel Thief, Haathi Mere Saathi (1971), and Anubhav (1971).   Tanuja was born in a Marathi family to filmmaker Kumarsen Samarth and actress Shobhna Samarth. She has three sisters, including actress Nutan and one brother. Her grandmother, Rattan Bai, and aunt Nalini Jaywant were also actresses. Tanuja's parents parted amicably while she was still a child, and Shobhana became linked to actor Motilal. Shobhana produced debut films for Tanuja and her older sister, Nutan. Her two other sisters are, Chatura, an artist, and Reshma, and brother is, Jaideep, neither of whom took to acting. Tanuja married filmmaker Shomu Mukherjee in 1973. The couple has two daughters, actresses as are Tanuja's daughters Kajol and Tanisha. Kajol is married to actor Ajay Devgan. Shomu died on 10 April 2008 from a heart attack aged 64. Filmmakers Joy, Deb and Ram are her brother-in-laws. She is the aunt of actors Mohnish Behl, Rani, and Sharbani, and director Ayan Mukherjee.

As an adult, she debuted in the film Chhabili (1960) which was directed by her mother and had her sister, Nutan, in the lead. The film that truly marked her transition into adult heroine came with Hamari Yaad Aayegi (1961), directed by Kidar Sharma, who had earlier discovered Raj Kapoor, Madhubala and Geeta Bali. One of her early films, noticeable for her acting, was Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi (1966), directed by Shaheed Latif. Incidentally it was Guru Dutt team's last offering, especially visible in the song, \"Woh Hanske Mile Humse\" (believed to have been picturized while Guru Dutt was still alive) who worked hard to help her \"tone down\" her performance. The result was that the natural, spontaneous performer gave a highly restrained performance which became the highlight of the film \u2014 as well of her career \u2014 as she moved to lead roles soon after. Tanuja had an important supporting role in the hit film, Jewel Thief. Her next big film was with Jeetendra, Jeene Ki Raah (1969), an immediate and surprise hit. In the same year, Tanuja won the Best Supporting Actress at Filmfare for Paisa Ya Pyar. After the success of Haathi Mere Saathi (1971), she acted in Door Ka Raahi, Mere jeevan Saathi, Do Chor and Ek Baar Muskara Do (1972), Kaam Chor, Yaarana, Khuddar, and Masoom. Some of the other films she has acted in are Pavitra Paapi, Bhoot Bangla, and Anubhav. Some of her Marathi films are 'Zaakol', 'Unad Maina' and Pitruroon. During the mid 1960s, Tanuja started a parallel career in Bengali movies in Kolkata starting with Deya Neya (1963) where she was paired opposite Uttam Kumar. She followed it up with Anthony-Firingee (1967) and Rajkumari (1970). Tanuja had on-screen chemistry with Soumitra Chatterjee with whom she made some films like Teen Bhuvaner Parey (1969) and Prothom Kadam Phool. Tanuja spoke her own lines in these Bengali films. Afterward, Tanuja retired from films for a number of years but came back when her marriage ended. She was now offered supporting roles often starring former heroes. Her Pyar Ki Kahani hero Amitabh Bachchan had to call her \"bhabhi\" (sister-in-law) in Khuddar (1982). She also played a supporting role in Raj Kapoor's Prem Rog (1982). She then appeared in films such as Saathiya (2002), Rules: Pyaar Ka Superhit Formula (2003), and Khakee (2003) as a supporting actress. In 2008, Tanuja starred as a judge along with her daughter, Kajol, and son-in-law, Ajay Devgan on Zee TV's family dance series Rock-N-Roll Family.

In 1999, Matondkar had six film releases; four of them \u2014Jaanam Samjha Karo, Hum Tum Pe Marte Hain, Mast and Dillagi \u2014were critical and commercial success.

Her first hit that year was Ram gopal Varma's thriller film Kaun, opposite Manoj Bajpai, in which she played , the nameless character. Khalid Mohamed of The Times of India (who would later cast her in Tehzeeb) wrote that she \"rivets the viewer's interest, carrying off entire reels on her shoulders, through a gamut of quicksilver facial expressions.

During the 2000s, Matondkar revealed strong, dramatic and psychological features in her roles, and delivered a number of critically acclaimed performances.

Deepa Gumaste, writing for Rediff, praised the performances of the three leads and wrote \"As usual, the heroine has little to do apart from looking cute in the first half and scared in the second.

She later received the national honour Rajiv Gandhi Award for the film, as a recognition to her achievement in Bollywood. Taran Adarsh wrote of her performance, \"...the film clearly belongs to Urmila Matondkar all the way. To state that she is excellent would be doing gross injustice to her work. Sequences when she is possessed are simply astounding. If this performance doesn't deserve an award, no other performance should. It beats all competition hollow\". Khalid Mohamed wrote, \"Matondkar is consistently excellent - controlled and persuasively vulnerable \u2013 as the beleaguered wife, evoking your concern and empathy. She\u2019s the major triumph of Bhoot actually\". . The film became successful at the box office with gross earnings of \u20b9224.1 million (US$3.5\u00a0million). In 2004, she got critical recognition for her performance as a merciless avenger in Ram Gopal Verma's Ek Hasina Thi, co-starring Saif Ali Khan Although the film was unsuccessful at the box office.

She next appeared in Pankaj Parashar's Love Story film Banaras: A Mystic Love Story with Ashmit Patel and Dimple Kapadia, the film was not well received by critics. Raja Sen described \"it as And then there's Urmila. Let's start with the good. She looks great, refreshingly beautiful and striking. That's about it. This is an actress who has worked hard to earn respectability, but this role, like the film itself, suffers from inconsistency\". She next starred alonsgide in the woman-centric drama Bas Ek Pal (2006). Matondkar's all four releases underperformed at the box office. Apart from holding a successful acting career, she is regarded as an outstanding dancer and has been a featured performer in many Bollywood item numbers. Her best-known item number is the Chamma Chamma sequence from the 1998 China Gate. Other hit numbers include Aaiye Aajaye from the hit film Lajja. She was signed to perform the item song in Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag, a remake of the 1975 blockbuster Sholay. She played the role originally played by Helen. In 2007, Matondkar lent her voice for Asha Bhonsle's album Asha and Friends Vol 1, where she performed with Bhosle the duet song \"Mehbooba Dilruba\". In fact, throughout the 1990s\u20132000s, Bhosle sang the maximum number of songs for Urmila. In that same year, she was seen on the second season of the dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa on Sony Television as a judge along with Jeetendra and Shiamak Davar. In 2008, Matondkar was seen with Himesh Reshammiya in a remake of the 1980 film Karz, titled Karzzzz. Even though the film was dubbed a failure critically, Urmila was praised for her acting and adding her own flavour to the role of Kamini.

        "artist_name": "Varun_Dhawan", 
        "biography": " Varun Dhawan (born 24 April 1987) is an Indian actor who appears in Hindi films. The son of film director David Dhawan, he studied Business Management from the Nottingham Trent University, after which he worked as an assistant director to Karan Johar on the 2010 drama My Name Is Khan. Dhawan made his acting debut with Johar's 2012 romantic comedy Student of the Year, for which he received a Filmfare nomination for Best Male Debut. Dhawan established himself in Bollywood by starring in the romance Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania (2014) and the dance film ABCD 2 (2015), both of which earned over \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide. He garnered a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for portraying an avenger in the crime thriller Badlapur (2015). Dhawan subsequently starred in the action drama Dilwale (2015), the crime drama Dishoom (2016), and the romantic comedy Badrinath Ki Dulhania (2017); the former ranks among the highest-grossing Bollywood films .   Varun Dhawan was born on 24 April 1987 in a Punjabi family to David Dhawan, a film director, and Karuna Dhawan. His elder brother, Rohit, is a film director, while his uncle, Anil, is an actor. He completed his HSC education from the H.R. College of Commerce and Economics. Dhawan has a degree in Business Management from the Nottingham Trent University, United Kingdom. Prior to his acting career, Dhawan worked as an assistant director to Karan Johar on his directorial terrorist drama My Name Is Khan (2010). In 2012, Dhawan made his acting debut with Johar's romantic comedy Student of the Year alongside Sidharth Malhotra and Alia Bhatt. He was confident as Rohan Nanda, the teenage son of a rich businessman, who competes with his girlfriend (played by Bhatt) and best friend (played by Malhotra) to win an annual school championship. Film critic Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama found Dhawan to be \"a talent one can't help but marvel at\" and CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand added: \"It\u2019s Varun Dhawan who stands out with a confident, charming turn, able to tackle both comical and vulnerable scenes with ease\". Student of the Year was a success, grossing \u20b9970 million (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide. In 2014, Dhawan had two film releases. His first appearance was in the comedy Main Tera Hero (2014), a remake of the Telugu film Kandireega, which was produced by Balaji Motion Pictures and directed by his father. He played the leading role of Sreenath \"Seenu\" Prasad, an impetuous brat, who is in love with Ileana D'Cruz's character but is seduced by the character played by Nargis Fakhri. Raedita Tandon of Filmfare commended Dhawan on his comic timing and compared him favorably to Govinda and Prabhudheva.. Dhawan then played Rakesh \"Humpty Sharma\", a flirtatious Punjabi boy who engages in a romantic affair with an engaged woman, in the romantic comedy Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania. Co-starring Alia Bhatt and Siddharth Shukla, the film was described as a tribute to Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) by Johar, who served as producer. Rohit Khilnani of India Today praised Dhawan's screen presence, and Nandini Ramnath of Mint noted how much he stood out in the \"few quieter scenes\" of the film. Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania emerged as one of top-grossing productions of the year, earning \u20b91.11 billion (US$17\u00a0million) worldwide. The crime thriller Badlapur (2015) from director Sriram Raghavan saw Dhawan play a man who over the course of 15 years avenges the murder of his wife and son. Portraying the character was a \"terrifying\" experience for Dhawan, who \"slipped into depression as after a point it no longer felt like I was acting in a film\". Raja Sen of Rediff.com praised Dhawan's acting range, writing that he \"sheds his easy-breezy charm \u2014 but, crucially, not his slightly hapless natural likeability \u2014 and bubbles up volcanically, his eyes frequently doing the talking.\" He received a Filmfare Award for Best Actor nomination for his performance. Dhawan next starred opposite Shraddha Kapoor in a sequel to the dance film ABCD: Any Body Can Dance, entitled ABCD 2, in which he portrays the real life character of Suresh Mukund, a dancer from Mumbai who wins the 2012 World Hip Hop Dance Championship. Critic Shilpa Jamkhandikar of Reuters criticised the film, finding Dhawan to be the only asset of the film, writing that \"except for the honest note he strikes, the rest of the film could have been just a bunch of music videos\". ABCD 2 earned \u20b91.57 billion (US$24\u00a0million) worldwide; the film's commercial performance led Box Office India to consider it an emergence of Dhawan's star power. His final appearance that year was in Rohit Shetty's ensemble action drama Dilwale, co-starring Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Kriti Sanon, in which he played the younger sibling of Khan's character. Despite negative reviews from critics, the film was a major commercial success and rank among the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time. Dhawan next starred in the action drama Dishoom (2016), directed by his brother Rohit, alongside John Abraham and Jacqueline Fernandez. He began 2017 by collaborating with Khaitan and Bhatt for the romantic comedy Badrinath Ki Dulhania, which served as the second installment of a franchise that began with Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania. The film tells the story of an independent young woman (Bhatt) from rural India who refuses to conform to patriarchal expectations from her chauvinistic fiancee (Dhawan). The film as well as Dhawan's performance was particularly praised. Shubhra Gupta from The Indian Express wrote that Dhawan \"impresses as a boy-struggling-to-be-a-man\". In addition, Tushar Joshi of Daily News and Analysis noted that \"Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt prove that on screen chemistry can be enough sometimes to keep you engaged in an average plot with a predictable narrative\". Both Dishoom and Badrinath Ki Dulhania were financial successes. As of January 2017, Dhawan has begun filming for his father's Judwaa 2, a sequel to the 1997 comedy film Judwaa, alongside Jacqueline Fernandez and Tapsee Pannu. Alongside his acting career, Dhawan performs on stage and has co-hosted two award ceremonies. In 2013, he performed at the Filmfare, Screen, and Stardust award ceremonies, and at an event in Hong Kong. He hosted the 2013 Stardust Awards ceremony with Sidharth Malhotra and Ayushmann Khurrana, and a segment of the 59th Filmfare Awards. He was also part of the 20th Screen Awards, co-hosting the show alongside Shahrukh Khan and Richa Chadda. In 2013, Dhawan performed at a special event alongside Malhotra, Alia Bhatt, Aditya Roy Kapur, Shraddha Kapoor and Huma Qureshi to raise funds for the flood-affected victims of Uttarakhand."

        "artist_name": "Vidya_Balan", 
        "biography": " Vidya Balan (pronounced [\u028b\u026ad\u032aja\u02d0 ba\u02d0l\u0259n]; born 1 January 1979) is an Indian actress. She has established a career in Bollywood and is the recipient of several awards, including a National Film Award, five Filmfare Awards, and five Screen Awards, and was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2014. She is known for portraying strong protagonists and has been acknowledged in the media for pioneering a change in the concept of a Hindi film heroine. Vidya aspired to a career in film from a young age, and had her first acting role in the 1995 sitcom Hum Paanch. She pursued a master's degree in sociology from the University of Mumbai and simultaneously made several unsuccessful attempts to start a career in film. She subsequently featured in television commercials and music videos. In 2003 she made her feature film debut as the protagonist of the independent Bengali drama Bhalo Theko. In 2005 Vidya garnered praise for her first Hindi film, the drama Parineeta, and followed it with a leading role in the highly successful 2006 comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. This initial success was followed by roles in the romantic comedies Heyy Babyy (2007) and Kismat Konnection (2008) which had negative reviews. By 2009 Vidya had established herself as a leading actress of Hindi cinema, as she went on to portray five consecutive roles to wide critical acclaim in the 2009 drama Paa, the 2010 black comedy Ishqiya, the 2011 semi-biographical thriller No One Killed Jessica, the 2011 biopic The Dirty Picture, and the 2012 thriller Kahaani. She followed this with a series of films that performed poorly at the box office, although her performance in Kahaani 2: Durga Rani Singh (2016) was praised. In addition to acting in films, Vidya promotes humanitarian causes and supports the empowerment of women. She initially drew criticism for her fluctuating weight and \"questionable\" dress sense, but was later credited in the media for \"not morphing herself to fit into any conventional slot\". She is married to the film producer Siddharth Roy Kapur.   Vidya Balan was born on 1 January 1979 in Chembur, Mumbai, to parents of Tamilian descent. Her father, P. R. Balan, is the executive vice-president of Digicable and her mother, Saraswathy Balan, is a homemaker. According to Vidya, they speak a mix of Malayalam and Tamil at home. Her elder sister, Priya Balan, works in advertising. The actress Priyamani is her second cousin. Vidya grew up in the suburban neighbourhood of Chembur, Mumbai and attended St. Anthony Girls' High School. From a young age she aspired to a career in film and was inspired by the work of actors Shabana Azmi and Madhuri Dixit. At the age of 16, she starred in the first season of Ekta Kapoor's sitcom Hum Paanch as Radhika, a bespectacled teenager. Following the success of the show, Vidya refused director Anurag Basu's offer to star in a television soap opera, as she wanted to concentrate on a film career. Her parents were supportive of the decision but encouraged her to complete her education first. She attended St. Xavier's College to pursue a bachelor's degree in sociology and later earned a master's degree from the University of Mumbai. While pursuing her master's degree, Vidya was cast as the female lead in the Malayalam film Chakram, opposite Mohanlal and was subsequently signed on for 12 other Malayalam language films. However, due to production difficulties, Chakram was shelved. The postponement of a film starring Mohanlal was an unheard of occurrence in Malayalam cinema and producers blamed Vidya for bringing \"bad luck\" to the project; labelled her as a \"jinx\"; and replaced her in the films that she had been contracted for. She shifted focus to Tamil cinema. In 2001, she was cast as the female lead in N. Linguswamy's Run (2002). However, after completing the first shooting schedule, she was unceremoniously dropped and replaced by Meera Jasmine. She was signed up under false pretences for a sex comedy, a genre she was uncomfortable with, and decided to leave the project. Thereafter, she signed on for a third Tamil film, Manasellam (2003), but was replaced by Trisha as the director was dissatisfied with her work. Kalari Vikraman, another Malayalam film that she completed work for in 2003, failed to get a theatrical release. After failing to start a film career, Vidya appeared in approximately 60 television commercials and in music videos for Euphoria and Shubha Mudgal; a majority of these were directed by Pradeep Sarkar. In 2003, she was signed on by Goutam Halder for his independent Bengali drama Bhalo Theko: her first film release. Her portrayal of Anandi, a young woman reminiscing about her past, won her an Anandalok Purashkar for Best Actress. In 2005 Vidya made her Hindi film debut with Pradeep Sarkar's musical drama Parineeta. Before being cast, she had to undergo extensive auditions for six months. The film, an adaptation of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel of the same name, narrated the love story of an idealist Lalita (Vidya) and a musician Shekhar (Saif Ali Khan), the son of a capitalist businessman. Her performance in the film was praised by critics; Derek Elley from Variety wrote, \"An acting revelation is Tamil newcomer [Vidya] Balan, whose devoted but dignified Lalita is the picture's heart and soul.\" Parineeta fetched her a Best Female Debut award and a nomination for Best Actress at the annual Filmfare Awards ceremony. The following year, Vidya appeared opposite Sanjay Dutt in Rajkumar Hirani's comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. She portrayed the role of Jhanvi, a radio jockey and the love interest of the protagonist Munna Bhai. To prepare for her role, she met with a couple of radio jockeys and watched them at work. Her performance was critically well received, and the film emerged as a blockbuster with earnings of \u20b91.19 billion (US$18\u00a0million). In 2007 Vidya featured in a supporting role in Mani Ratnam's semi-biographical drama Guru as a woman suffering from multiple sclerosis. The film, which starred Mithun Chakraborty, Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, and R. Madhavan in leading roles, performed well at the box office. However, film critics Khalid Mohamed and Raja Sen noted that her \"talent was wasted\" in a \"minuscule role\". Her next release was Nikhil Advani's Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute To Love, a romantic comedy featuring an ensemble cast, in which she was paired opposite John Abraham. The film, which narrated six love stories, saw Vidya play the role of a television reporter, Tehzeeb Hussain, suffering from a memory loss condition. The film, which was a critical and commercial failure, generated positive reviews for Vidya. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com wrote, \"Vidya's transformation from a self-assured working woman to a helpless, vulnerable person is superb.\" Vidya then took a supporting role in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's drama Eklavya: The Royal Guard, alongside Amitabh Bachchan, Boman Irani, Sharmila Tagore, Saif Ali Khan, and Sanjay Dutt. The film, which failed commercially, met with positive critical reviews and was selected as India's official entry to the Oscars for the 80th Academy Awards. She was later cast as Isha Sahni, a single mother, in Sajid Khan's Heyy Babyy, alongside co-stars Akshay Kumar, Ritesh Deshmukh, and Fardeen Khan. The comedy was a box-office success but garnered negative reviews from critics, as did Vidya's performance; CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand criticised her wardrobe and make-up, and considered her the \"sore thumb\" of the film. Vidya's fifth and final film of 2007 was Priyadarshan's Bhool Bhulaiyaa, a remake of the Malayalam film Manichitrathazhu (1993). Vidya featured as Avani Chaturvedi (a character played by Shobana in the Malayalam original), a woman suffering from dissociative identity disorder. Co-starring Shiney Ahuja, Akshay Kumar, and Ameesha Patel, Bhool Bhulaiyaa was a commercial success with a worldwide revenue of over \u20b9830 million (US$13\u00a0million). Reviewers, while being generally negative of the film, were appreciative of Vidya's performance. Writing for Hindustan Times, Khalid Mohamed described her as \"bankably likeable\" and Bollywood Hungama's Taran Adarsh labelled her as \"splendid\". The role earned Vidya a second Filmfare nomination in the Best Actress category. In 2008's Halla Bol, Vidya played a supporting role alongside Ajay Devgn and Pankaj Kapur. The story was based on the life of activist Safdar Hashmi, who was killed by political rivals while performing in a street play (Halla Bol) in 1989. The film was a critical failure. Later that year, she co-starred with Shahid Kapoor in Aziz Mirza's romantic comedy Kismat Konnection. Faring poorly at the box office, the film and her performance generated a negative response; critic Sonia Chopra commented, \"[Balan] is made to look downright drab. The haircut is unflattering, the make-up too plain, the clothes usually in off-white or brown. Plus the character is repetitive and reminds us of the one she played in Lage Raho Munna Bhai.\" In 2009 Vidya played the role of an unwed gynaecologist struggling with her 12-year-old son's progeria syndrome, in the R. Balki-directed dramedy Paa. Amitabh Bachchan played the role of Vidya's son and Abhishek Bachchan played the title character. A critical and commercial success, the film has been described as a major turning point in her career. Sukanya Verma compared her acting style to that of Dimple Kapadia and noted, \"Balan is poignant yet restrained and projects an impressive figure of grace and integrity\"; Nikhat Kazmi from The Times of India further argued that Vidya was successful in lending a \"rare dignity to the image of the Bollywood mom.\" Her portrayal garnered her several awards, including a Filmfare Award for Best Actress and a Screen Award for Best Actress. Vidya followed the success of Paa with the Vishal Bhardwaj-produced Ishqiya (2010), a black comedy directed by debutant Abhishek Chaubey; co-starring Naseeruddin Shah, Arshad Warsi, and Salman Shahid. Vidya's role was that of the sexually manipulative Krishna Verma. Vidya described her character as \"an epitome of grey\" and a departure from the conventional portrayal of women in cinema. In preparation for her part, she undertook professional training to speak in the local Uttar Pradesh-dialect. The feature as well as her performance received critical acclaim. Anupama Chopra of NDTV stated, \"Vidya Balan's smoldering looks scorch the screen even as her eyes hint at tragedy. She proves that she is miles ahead of the cookie cutter Barbie dolls that clutter Bollywood and that sensuality has very little to do with showing skin.\" Her work in the film earned Vidya a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress, a second consecutive Best Actress award at Screen and a nomination for Best Actress at Filmfare. Raj Kumar Gupta's semi-biographical thriller No One Killed Jessica with Rani Mukerji was Vidya's first release of 2011. The film, based on the Jessica Lal murder case, saw her portray the real-life character of Sabrina Lal, Jessica's reticent sister. While preparing for the role, Vidya did not meet Lal on the insistence of Gupta as \"the Sabrina [...] today is different from the Sabrina a decade ago, [when] the story begins\". No One Killed Jessica met with contrasting reviews from critics, but Vidya's performance was particularly praised. The Hindu remarked on Vidya's ability to be \"in sublime control over her emotions\" and Savera Someshwar of Rediff.com added that \"her hesitant body language, her faith, her helplessness, her rage, her sorrow and her gratitude all come across beautifully\". The film had earnings of \u20b9490 million (US$7.6\u00a0million) and was noted for being a commercial success despite the absence of a male lead. Vidya earned another Filmfare nomination in the Best Actress category for the film. In March 2011, a retrospective of Vidya's films was held in Australia, as part of the Bollywood and Beyond festival. That same year, Vidya featured in a guest appearance in Santosh Sivan's Malayalam language fantasy film Urumi. Vidya's next appearance was in Ekta Kapoor's production The Dirty Picture, a biopic based on the life and death of the controversial Indian actress Silk Smitha. Vidya was cast as Silk, who was\u2014in Vidya's words\u2014\"known for her brazenness and in-your-face sexuality.\" She described the role as the \"boldest\" she had ever played, one that \"required a lot of mental preparation.\" To look the part, she gained 12 kilograms (26\u00a0lb). The film opened to major critical acclaim, and Vidya received unanimous praise for her portrayal which several reviewers regarded as her best performance to date. Khalid Mohamed observed, \"She's extraordinary: gutsy, consistently in character and unafraid of exposing her darker side. Here's the kind of complex performance which you haven't evidenced in years and years.\" Her director Milan Luthria described her as the contemporary claimant of the \"sex-symbol\" title and compared her \"voluptuousness\" to the likes of yesteryear actresses Sridevi and Vyjayanthimala. The film was eventually declared a blockbuster, earning \u20b91.14 billion (US$18\u00a0million) worldwide. Vidya won a second Filmfare Award, a third consecutive Screen Award, and a National Film Award for Best Actress. For her next feature film, Vidya starred as Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant woman in search of her missing husband in Sujoy Ghosh's Kahaani (2012). The thriller, set in the city of Kolkata during the Durga Puja festivities, met with wide critical acclaim. To lend authenticity to her part, Vidya met several pregnant women and learnt about their lifestyle. She generated public and media attention by wearing a fake baby bump during the film's promotional activities. Vidya received further appreciation for her performance in Kahaani. Subhash K. Jha praised Vidya's portrayal of \"grace under pressure\" as \"measured and skilled\"; Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph added that she \"gets into the physicality of a pregnant woman with unfailing mastery\". Kahaani emerged as a major commercial success both at the domestic and international box office, with revenues of over \u20b91.04 billion (US$16\u00a0million). Vidya won a fourth consecutive Best Actress Award at Screen and a third Best Actress Award at Filmfare. After completing the duties of a jury member at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, Vidya starred opposite Emraan Hashmi as a boisterous Punjabi woman in Ghanchakkar, a comic-thriller from director Raj Kumar Gupta. Critics were unenthusiastic about the film and it earned little at the box office. Vidya then provided the voice of Draupadi for Mahabharat, a 3D animation film based on the Indian epic of the same name. The romantic comedy Shaadi Ke Side Effects was Vidya's first film release of 2014. Directed by Saket Chaudhary and co-starring Farhan Akhtar, the film tells the story of a married couple who face a series of comic events after the birth of their first child. Critics found the film to be a \"bit overstretched\", but praised both Akhtar and Vidya's performances. Also that year, Vidya featured as the host of No More Kamzor, a television special on women empowerment. She then starred in the comedy-drama Bobby Jasoos, which saw her play the eponymous role of a Hyderabadi woman aspiring to be a detective. Vidya was drawn to the idea of playing a detective and identified with the character's struggle to \"do something unusual\" in life. The role required her to sport twelve elaborate disguises, and she trained with a language coach to adopt a Hyderabadi accent. Saumil Gandhi of Mumbai Mirror wrote that Vidya's \"effervescence rubs off on the proceedings and gives it an energy that drives the film\". However, both Shaadi Ke Side Effects and Bobby Jasoos failed to find a wide audience. In 2015, Vidya reteamed with Hashmi in the Mohit Suri-directed romantic drama Hamari Adhuri Kahani. Penned by Mahesh Bhatt, the film tells the story of Vasudha, a single mother trapped in an abusive marriage, who has an extra-marital affair. Shubha Shetty-Saha of Mid Day reviewed, \"Vidya Balan, a fine actress with thousand emotions fleeting across her lovely face, has shown us what she's capable of in her earlier movies. But here, saddled with a boring, outdated, weepy character, there was nothing much even she could do\". Vidya next took on the part of a police officer in Te3n (2016), a thriller inspired by the 2013 South Korean film Montage, co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. She was attracted to the idea of playing a \"no-nonsense police inspector who commands much respect\" and was particularly drawn to her character's \"silent aggression\". NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee criticised the decision to bill Vidya's pivotal role as a special appearance and noted how much her presence benefited the film. Rajeev Masand was critical of the film's predictable denouement, but wrote that Vidya \"is reliably solid each time she\u2019s on screen, raising her brow, curling her lip to effectively communicate more than words can\". She then portrayed the actress Geeta Bali in multiple songs for Ekk Albela, a Marathi language biopic of the actor-director Bhagwan Dada. Vidya's final release of the year was Sujoy Ghosh's Kahaani 2: Durga Rani Singh, a sequel Kahaani, although it narrated a different story. The film was highly anticipated, and critics believed that Vidya's recent spate of poorly received films would come to an end. Kahaani 2, however, was not as well-received as the first film, although Vidya received a Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her portrayal of a child sexual abuse survivor in the film. Raja Sen thought that despite being an engaging thriller the film's denouement was predictable, but added that \"with tremendous commitment to the part, [Vidya] gives us a stirring performance free of vanity or obviousness\" and praised her \"knack for winning the audience over; when she gasps, we gasp\". Srijit Mukherji's period drama Begum Jaan (2017) saw Vidya play the role of the titular procurer. A Hindi language remake of the Bengali film Rajkahini (2015), Begum Jaan tells the story of how the lives of prostitutes living in brothel are affected by the partition of India in 1947. In preparation, Vidya worked with Mukherji to provide a backstory to her character, and she researched on the era by reading Urvashi Butalia\u2019s novel The Other Side of Silence. Filming in the barren landscape of rural Jharkhand proved to be a challenge for Vidya, and she said that the experience taught her that \"if push comes to shove, I can brave scorpions, snakes and whatever else\". Anna M.M. Vetticad of Firstpost disliked the film, and wrote that \"[Vidya] \u2013 who has been so wonderful in the past \u2013 is unable to dig deep and summon up a relatable human being, because there is nothing in the writing that she can dig into.\" As of April 2017, Vidya has committed to play a radio jockey who anchors a relationship advice talk show in the romantic comedy Tumhari Sulu. The mass media has often speculated about a romantic relationship between Vidya and her co-actors, but she has strongly denied these reports. In 2009, Vidya was involved in a controversy when she mentioned a previous relationship in which \"caustic remarks\" were made at her due to her weight. She said, \"If someone who matters to you takes you down, it can break you. That someone whose approval mattered to me started to constantly find faults with me. At that point of time, it was important to walk away from that relationship.\" Though she refused to name the person, tabloid reports suggested that she was referring to Shahid Kapoor (her co-star in Kismat Konnection). Kapoor, however, denied the allegations. During an interview in May 2012, Vidya announced that she was dating Siddharth Roy Kapur, the CEO of UTV Motion Pictures. On 14 December 2012, the couple were married in a private ceremony in Bandra, Mumbai. Vidya is trained in carnatic music and briefly studied the dance forms of Bharatnatyam and Kathak. Regarding her religious affiliations, Vidya said, \"I am a person with a lot of faith and I have conversations [with God] all the time but I am not so religious in the conventional, organised sense\". She practices vegetarianism and was listed as \"India's hottest vegetarian\" in polls conducted by PETA in 2011 and 2012. Her weight fluctuations over the years have been the subject of substantial media coverage in India. Besides acting in film, Vidya promotes humanitarian causes and supports charitable institutions. In March 2011, she endorsed World Wildlife Fund's Earth Hour campaign in India. She campaigned for the cause of nutrition in India for Child In Need Institute (CINI), a non-profit organisation based in Kolkata. In September 2012, Vidya visited a village in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh, where she participated in a campaign to promote children's education and the empowerment of women. For her attempts to empower women, Vidya was awarded The Prabha Khaitan Puraskar 2012 by the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce; she was the youngest recipient of the award. Vidya has also been appointed by the Government of India as their brand ambassador in the drive to improve the country's sanitary condition. In August 2013, she served as the grand marshal of the India Day parade held in New York City. In September that year, she launched a technology-based learning platform for underprivileged children in the Thanapur village of Uttar Pradesh. On the occasion of International Women's Day in 2015, Vidya wrote an opinion column in Hindustan Times on the issues faced by women in India. Following the success of Parineeta and Lage Raho Munna Bhai, Vidya's film roles were subject to wide critical analysis. Vir Sanghvi noted that the films Heyy Babyy and Kismat Konnection were \"strange films [...] in which she tried to pretend to be what she is not\u00a0\u2014 a Bollywood bimbette.\" Vidya described that particular phase in her career as a \"struggle to be someone else\". Due to the criticism that her film choices evoked, Vidya decided to choose roles that she \"believed in\" rather than choose by convention. Members of the media have subsequently labelled her as \"bold\" and \"daring\" in her choices. Her starring roles in Heyy Babyy and Kismat Konnection also led to considerable attention in the media for her \"questionable wardrobe\". Several publications listed her as the \"worst dressed actress\" and her costume designers attributed her failure to carry off western clothes due to her weight and body structure. She was later praised in the media for wearing saris at public events; designer Niharika Khan explained, \"Vidya's beauty lies in her curves. She's comfortable in her voluptuousness, and therefore in a sari.\" Vidya has since been identified as defying \"an anglicised idea of sexuality\" and embody the idea of \"raw Indian sexuality\". After portraying strong protagonists in Paa, Ishqiya, No One Killed Jessica, The Dirty Picture and Kahaani, Vidya was credited in the media for pioneering a movement that breaks the stereotypical portrayal of heroines in Bollywood. The major commercial success of the latter two earned her the title of a \"female hero\" and Kalpana Nair of First Post noted that with these two films Vidya spearheaded a change in the roles that were offered to actresses over 30. Critic Mayank Shekhar predicted, \"Just a few smart male actors can completely change the face of a commercial, star-driven film industry. Looking at [...] Vidya Balan [...] it appears, that change could well originate from the leading lady instead.\" India Today featured her in their listing of the \"25 Power Women\" and noted that \"she has toppled the all dominating hero, reducing him to a supporting role in a male dominated film industry\". Vidya occupied the top slot in Rediff.com's annual listing of \"Bollywood's Best Actress\" for two consecutive years (2010\u201311). She also featured in the list for the years 2005, 2006, 2009, and 2012. In 2010, she featured in Filmfare's listing of the \"Women we love\". In 2012, the magazine Verve listed her as one of India's \"Young Power Women\" and wrote, \"In a reel world peopled by size zero-toned bodies and pretty-as-a-picture heroines, Vidya comes across as completely real and natural\u00a0\u2013 a woman who has followed her own instincts and dared to live her destiny by being her own person and not morphing herself to fit into any conventional slot.\" In 2014, Vidya was awarded the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India, for her contributions to the entertainment industry. The following year, she received an honorary Doctor of Arts degree from Rai University; the university also named a scholarship program for underprivileged girls after her. The chancellor of the university, Harbeen Arora said, \"Among the league of iconic actors, Vidya is a pioneer in every way. Her films epitomise a distinct Indianness and a powerful womanhood\". Among Vidya's film awards are a National Film Award for Best Actress for The Dirty Picture (2011), and five Filmfare Awards: Best Female Debut for Parineeta (2005), Best Actress for Paa (2009), The Dirty Picture (2011), and Kahaani (2012), and Critics Award for Best Actress for Ishqiya (2010).

        "biography": " Vyjayanthimala Bali (born 13 August 1933), also known by the mononym Vyjayanthimala, is an Indian film actress, Bharathanatyam dancer, Carnatic singer, dance choreographer and parliamentarian. She was referred to as the first female superstar of Hindi cinema. She made her debut in the Tamil language film Vazhkai in 1949 and in the Telugu film Jeevitham in 1950. She later became one of the most prominent actresses of South Indian cinema and in the golden era of Bollywood and was known as one of the iconic leading actress of all time. Vyjayanthimala was one of the biggest Bollywood stars with a career lasting almost two decades. She was the first south Indian actress to become a national star and \"paved a way\" for other south Indian actresses to foray into Bollywood. Vyjayanthimala is an accomplished dancer and was one of those who introduced semi-classical dance to Bollywood. Her subsequent dance numbers in her films had earned her the title of \"twinkle toes\". Vyjayanthimala made her screen debut at the age of 16 through the Tamil film Vazhkai (1949) and Telugu film Jeevitham in 1950 and acted in Bollywood movies Bahar and Ladki. Following the success of Nagin, Vyjayanthimala established herself as one of Bollywood's leading actresses while making in-roads in successful Tamil and Telugu films. After successfully establishing herself as a commercial actress, Vyjayanthimala appeared in Devdas playing Chandramukhi, the hooker with a heart of gold, in 1955. In her first dramatic role, she received her first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 4th Filmfare Awards where she refused to accept the award citing that hers was not a supporting role, being the first person to refuse a Filmfare Award. Following that, Vyjayanthimala appeared in series of blockbuster films such as New Delhi, Naya Daur and Aasha. She reached the pinnacle of her success in 1958, when two of her films \u2014 Sadhna and Madhumati \u2014 became huge critical and commercial hits. She was nominated for two Filmfare Award for Best Actress Award for Sadhna and Madhumati and won the award for the former. At this point, Vyjayanthimala made comeback to the Tamil films, where she tasted commercial success with Vanjikottai Valiban, Irumbu Thirai, Baghdad Thirudan and Then Nilavu. In 1961, the release of Dilip Kumar's Ganga Jumna saw her playing a rustic village belle Dhanno who speaks Bhojpuri dialect. Critics applauded her performance with some labeled it as her best till date. She won her second Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her role in Ganga Jumna. Beginning from 1962, most of her films performed either averagely or poorly at the box office. However, in 1964, with the success of Sangam her career hits the peak again. She reinvented herself playing a modern Indian girl appearing in revealing costumes and one-piece swimsuit. She went to receive her third Best Actress Award at the 12th Filmfare Awards for her role as Radha in Sangam. She later achieve critical acclaim for her performance in the historical drama Amrapali, which was based on the life of Nagarvadhu (royal courtesan) of Vaishali, Amrapali. The film received universal acclaim, but it was a huge box office failure, which left Vyjayanthimala, who had a huge expectation on the film, disenchanted to the point where she decided to quit films. In the end of her career Vyjayanthimala was mostly seen in commercially successful films such as Suraj, Jewel Thief and Prince with few critically acclaimed films such as Hatey Bazarey and Sunghursh. Most of them were released after Vyjayanthimala had left the film industry. Besides films, Vyjayanthimala's main concentration was in Bharata Natyam a form of Indian classical dance. After quitting movies Vyjayanthimala Bali continued with her dance career. In addition, she was conferred with the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, the highest Indian recognition given to practising artists. The award was presented to Vyjayanthimala in 1982 for her contribution in Bharata Natyam field. Moreover, Vyjayanthimala is an avid golfer and is one of the oldest in Chennai. She has also served as chairperson of 48th National Film Awards.   She was born in Triplicane near Parthasarathy Temple in Tamil family to M. D. Raman and Vasundhara Devi. Her mother was a leading actress in Tamil Cinema in the 1940s where her Mangama Sabatham was the first Tamil film to be declared a \"colossal\" hit at the box office. She used to call her mother by her name as her mother was only 16 years older. Similarly, she called her father \"Anna\", meaning elder brother, as her father happened to be the eldest in their family and everyone called him \"Anna\" which is common in a Hindu joint family. She was raised primarily by her maternal grandmother, Yadugiri Devi, and M.D. Raman. She was known as \"Papakutty\", which means little child. Her ancestors were from Mysore (now in Karnataka). In 1938, her grandfather Gopalacharya, the late Mandayam Dhati, started a nursing home on Narayan Shastri Road, Mysore. At the age of seven, Vyjayanthimala was chosen to perform a classical Indian dance for Pope Pius XII while her mother was an audience in 1940 at Vatican City. Vyjayanthi did her schooling from Sacred Heart Higher Secondary School, Presentation Convent, Church Park, Chennai.

Her maternal uncle is Y. G. Parthasarathy. When director M. V. Raman was looking for a new face to cast in AVM Productions's Vazhkai, he saw Vyjayanthimala performing Bharata Natyam in Chennai's Gokhale Hall. He tried to convince her grandmother, who was apprehensive about Vyjayanthimala joining films as she felt it would come in the way of her education and dance. Vyjayanthimala played a college girl named Mohana Shivashankaralingam and acted along with senior actors S. V. Sahasranamam, M. S. Draupadi, T. R. Ramachandran and K. Sankarapani. The movie was a big success and was remade in Telugu after one year as Jeevitham with a slightly different cast, namely C. H. Narayana Rao, S. Varalakshmi and C. S. R. Anjaneyulu. This film enjoyed great success upon release. For the Telugu version, Vyjayanthimala did her own voice dubbing with a little assistance from her father who knew Telugu well and coached her during the filming process. Vyjayanthimala also did a guest appearance in the 1950 film Vijayakumari which had actress T. R. Rajakumari in dual role. She danced for the song \"laalu...laalu...laalu\" which was choreographed by Vedantam Raghavaiah. Though the film was not a commercial success but her western-style of dance became popular and was considered as one of the major highlights of the film. The success of her Tamil film Vazhkai in South India inspired AVM Productions to remake it in Hindi as Bahar in 1951. In their first Hindi venture, they decided to cast Vyjayanthimala again in the lead role with Karan Dewan, Om Prakash and Pandari Bai (who was credited as Padmini in the film). She learned Hindi at the Hindi Prachar Sabha to dub her own voice for her character in the film. Upperstall.com in their review, wrote that \"She does bring the film to life with her dances though, something which was new then for the North Indian audience\". The film became sixth highest-grossing film of 1951 with a verdict of box-office hit. After the success of her debut films in all three languages, Vyjayanthimala again acted in multilingual film which was produced by Avichi Meiyappa Chettiar of AVM Productions. The first version was in Tamil as Penn where she co-starred with actor Gemini Ganesan, S. Balachandran and Anjali Devi. \"Kalyanam...venum\" sung by J. P. Chandrababu for S. Balachandran became an instant hit. The second version was in Telugu titled Sangham which was released in the same year with N. T. Rama Rao, Vyjayanthimala, S. Balachandran and Anjali Devi in the lead. The Tamil and the Telugu films were big successes across South India. The film was once again remade in Hindi as Ladki starring Bharat Bhushan, Kishore Kumar while Vyjayanthimala along with Anjali Devi reprised her role from the original film. Her performance was described by Upperstall.com as, \"Vyjayanthimala's dances are the film's saving grace although it is unintentionally funny now to see how deliberate and obviously tacky the sequences are which lead into her dances[...]Ladki too makes no real demands on 'feminist' tomboy Vyjayanthimala histrionically\". The movie became second highest-grossing film of 1953. In 1954, Vyjayanthimala acted in magnum opus film Nagin with Pradeep Kumar. The film got favourable responses from the audience and became the highest-grossing movie of 1954 where it was labelled as blockbuster. Her performance as the Nagi tribe's chief, Mala got her favourable reviews from the critics, where in 1955 a critic from Filmfare magazine had said that \"Vyjayanthimala in the title role puts over a commendable performance besides looking ravishingly beautiful as the belle of the hills. Her dancing, too, is very graceful, specially in those eye-filling colour sequences and delightful ballets towards the finish\" while in The Hindu review Vijay Lokapally similarly praised her portrayal \"The ethereal Vyjayanthimala, barely 18, illuminates the screen with her stunning beauty, moving around daintily from one song to the other[...]The close-up shots of Vyjayanthimala highlight her ability to convey so much with so little effort[...]Nagin was a precursor to her rise in Hindi cinema as an iconic actor, who combined her talents, performing and dancing, to rule the screen on her terms[...]biggest recall values of Nagin are Vyjayanthimala\". Post Nagin Vyjayanthimala had established herself as one of the leading actresses in Bollywood because of the film's nationwide success. Hemant Kumar's music and her dance on the song, Man Dole, Mera tan dole, rendered by Lata Mangeshkar was one of the highlights of the film. In the same year she acted in Miss Mala with Kishore Kumar whichwas a box office success. Vyjayanthimala debuted in Kannada cinema through a film called Asha Nirasha which was produced by G. D. Venkatram. The film had Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle and Mohammed Rafi as the playback singers, but the movie was unreleased though the producer's son Srikant Venkatram claimed that the film was released and flopped miserably at box office which made the film obscure. In 1955, Vyjayanthimala acted in 5 films in Bollywood. The first one was by director Abdur Rashid Kardar's Yasmin alongside actor Suresh which won the Filmfare Best Cinematographer for Dwarka Divecha. Besides that, she also starred in three other films namely Pehli Jhalak with Kishore Kumar, Sitara with Pradeep Kumar and Jashan with Karan Dewan. Eventually all her four films released in 1955 failed at box office. The same year, Bimal Roy cast her as Chandramukhi opposite Dilip Kumar in the critically acclaimed Devdas which was the adaptation of the novel with same title by Sharat Chandra Chatterji. The industry initially was not in favour of this choice when they heard about Vyjayanthimala being cast in Bimal Roy's film, the response being: \"Why don't you take comedian Kishore Kumar as Devdas?\". Initially Nargis was selected for Chandramukhi's role, but she refused to accept the role. The role was later offered to Bina Rai and Suraiya but they too turned it down as they wanted to essay the lead role of Paro, which was earlier offered to Meena Kumari. Subsequently, the film unit suffered with financial crisis and at this point Vyjayanthimala offered to do the role of Chandramukhi where she said to Bimal Roy, \"I am ready if you think I can do it\". On the other hand, Nabendu Ghosh, the script writer of Devdas, said that, \"I did not approve of Vyjayanthimala [as Chandramukhi], but we had no option \u2013 no one wanted to play Chandramukhi, and we were committed to our distributors[...]She was, of course, a very good actress, but she was too young for Chandramukhi, as envisioned by Saratbabu\". On her performance, Rediff wrote, \"Vyjayanthimala imbues Chandramukhi with true sympathy. Who better than Chandramukhi would know the pain of a hopeless love?[...]Vyjayanthimala, a star after the blockbuster Nagin, still had to establish her acting credentials when Roy went against the tide and cast her in the role of Chandramukhi\". While Upperstall.com describes her performance as, \"Vyjayantimala's Chandramukhi is embellished with her graceful dance style that evolves with the evolution in her character within the film from a popular dancing woman to a woman, who, in love with Devdas, has unconsciously mutated to reflect the mainstream woman. For Vyjayantimala, the character marked a turning point from glamour to pure histrionics, offering her scope to explore her potential as a dramatic actress without taking away from her, the most outstanding gift she brought to cinema\u00a0\u2013 her dance\". Subsequently, she won Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress but refused to accept it, stating that her role was a leading one and in equal importance to the role played by Suchitra Sen and not supporting. In 2006, a poll conducted by Rediff ranked her role of Chandramukhi as one of the best Tawaif character in Bollywood. Subsequently, the same role was listed in The Times of India's \"10 Celluloid Hookers You Loved\" at number six by Nikhat Kazmi. Though the film was critically successful but it did not garner much support at the box office and ended up as 10th highest-grossing movie of 1955 with an average verdict . After being recognised as a capable actress with Devdas, Vyjayanthimala acted in successful movies in 1956, namely Taj, Patrani and Anjaan: Somewhere in Dehli - all three films with Pradeep Kumar as the hero and Kismet Ka Khel with Sunil Dutt. In the same year, she also acted in swashbuckler film Devta which was a remake of a hugely successful Tamil film Kanavaney Kankanda Deivam. Surprisingly though, she accepted a supporting role as a vamp which was originally done by Lalitha in the Tamil version. However, according to Upperstall.com, her role was very crucial in the film and her portrayal as the Naag Rani accompanied by her dance is the main attraction of the film. Also starring in the movie, reprising their lead roles from the original, were Gemini Ganesan and Anjali Devi. Meanwhile, she was signed by Sohrab Modi for his film Rajhath opposite Pradeep Kumar. However, due to her schedule problem she was replaced by Madhubala. Vyjayanthimala then acted with Kishore Kumar again in the comedy film New Delhi which became the fifth highest-grossing film of 1956 a box-office hit. The film showcases a love that sprouts between a Punjabi boy, played Kishore Kumar, and Tamil girl, played by Vyjayanthimala. Her performance was applauded by fans and critics alike; a review on Upperstall.com regarding her performance in this movie states that, \"Vyjayanthimala proves to be the perfect foil for Kishore Kumar[...]has always had the mandatory dance sequence in practically every film of hers evoking 'classical art' associations. She excels in the two main dances in New Delhi\u00a0\u2014 the solo Bharatnatayam Aliruppu number and the Bhangra folk dance in her Punjabi avtaar and she is absolutely brilliant in the Bhangra folk dance[...]in her second avtar. Even Vyjayanthimala played a Punjabi girl and most successfully too\". Subsequently, she did a Tamil film called Marma Veeran along with Sriram, Rajasulochana, M. N. Rajam, J. P. Chandrababu and Chittor V. Nagaiah. The film had some of the South Indian established actors such as N. T. Rama Rao, Sivaji Ganesan and Gemini Ganesan in guest appearance. In 1957, director B. R. Chopra planned to make Naya Daur with Ashok Kumar in the lead. However, the actor refused to accept this role and it later went to Dilip Kumar. For the female lead, the first choice of the director was the star-actress of those days, Madhubala. But, as fate would have it, after 15 days of initial shooting at Mumbai, the director wanted the unit to travel to Bhopal for an extended outdoor shooting. However, Ataullah Khan, the father of Madhubala, objected to this and the role went to Vyjayanthimala. Chopra later sued Madhubala for the cash advance she received from him for the film, saying that she accepted the sum and now had no intention of completing it. Vyjyanthimala had previously acted with Dilip Kumar in Devdas and the duo shared an easy chemistry on-screen. The new film, Naya Daur, had a theme of \"man vs. machine\" and Vyjanthi's portrayal of a village belle Rajni received positive reviews from critics. A review from Rediff says that, \"Vyjayanthimala too is not your average petulant gaon ki gori. She ably projects a hands-on worker who comes up with ideas on how to ford a stream and risks her life to save the bridge[...]wonderful scene between two stars whose chemistry is undeniable\" while reviewer Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama mentions that, \"Commendable performances come in from Vyjayantimala [natural][...]The relationships [Dilip Kumar-Vyjayantimala] are so human and believable\". At the end of its theatrical run, the film had collected around \u20b9 54,000,000, thus becoming the second highest-grossing film of 1957, second only to the critically acclaimed Mother India which became the highest grossing Bollywood film ever at the time. Following that, Vyjayanthimala almost signed for the lead role in Filmistan's Tumsa Nahin Dekha opposite Dev Anand in 1957, but due to the producer Sashadhar Mukherjee's promise to actor Shammi Kapoor, he replaced Dev Anand with Shammi Kapoor. However the director, Nasir Hussain was in a quandary as he had already read the script to Dev Anand and Vyjayanthimala but Mukerji prevailed and he also replaced Vyjayanthimala with Ameeta, who was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Filmistan Studios owner Tolaram Jalan. Vyjayanthimala's next release was Kathputli in which she co-starred with actor Balraj Sahni for the first time. This film was about a young girl named Pushpa who, on account of being a good dancer and singer, assists puppeteer Shivraj in his puppet show. This film was director Amiya Chakravarty's last film. He died during the filming of Kathputli and the remaining project was completed by director Nitin Bose. Kathputli remains as one of the memorable film of Vyjayanthimala which has an offbeat theme with a Pygmalion touch. Vyjayanthimala then acted in Ek Jhalak with Rajendra Kumar and Pradeep Kumar which was produced by the latter with his home production company Deep & Pradeep Productions. She returned to the screen again with Kishore Kumar in the 1957 partially colour-made film Aasha which became a hit at the box office. The story revolves around the central character Kishore, played by Kishore Kumar, who, despite being a Zamindaar, believes in helping the needy. Vyjayanthimala, as Nirmala, plays the lover of Kishore. The story suddenly goes from being light-hearted and humorous to a court-drama when Kishore is falsely accused for murder. The rest of the movie sees both the protagonists trying to prove Kishore's innocence. The movie is best known for its song Eena Meena Dekha sung by Kishore Kumar and Asha Bhosle, in two different versions Aasha also introduced actress Asha Parekh, to the silver screen, in a song alongside Vyjayanthimala, whom Parekh described as her matinee idol. The following year proved to be very successful for Vyjayanthimala where she signed opposite Dilip Kumar in Bimal Roy's Madhumati in the title role. Originally supposed to essay four roles, the director finally scaled it down to three, Madhumati, Madhavi and Radha. The film was launched in front of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival Theatre in Czechoslovakia. During the filming at the hills of Nainital, Vyjayanthimala was required to dance with barefoot where she tripped on a stone and fell while hurting herself badly causing damage to her fibre tissues in the sole of her foot. Roy who was terrified and in a quandary over the incident as the shooting could not be stopped insisted on her wearing sandals which made it difficult for her during running sequences. Even after the completion of Madhumati, she still encountered the pain from the injury which always reminded her of Madhumati's shooting experience. Written by Ritwik Ghatak, the film is about Devendra, played by Dilip Kumar, who takes shelter during a storm in an abandoned house. Here he discovers a painting of the owner of the house Raja Ugranarayan painted by him in his previous life when was Anand, also played by Dilip Kumar, and worked as a foreman on a plantation of Raja Ugranarayan. Devendra had been in love with Madhumati, played by Vyjayanthimala. She had committed suicide while trying to save herself from Ugranarayan\u2019s advances. Madhumati\u2019s ghost finally takes revenge on Ugranarayan. The film was well received by critics and audience where it became highest grossing Bollywood film of 1958 and was labelled as blockbuster at box office and ended up as fifth highest-grossing film of the decade with its adjusted inflation net gross to about \u20b9586.4\u00a0million. Her performance as Madhavi, Radha and the ghost Madhumati earned her accoladates from critics. Shahid Khan from Planetbollywood.com said \"Vyjayantimala has never been one of my most favourite actresses but this is one of the few performances where I am completely bowled over by her. Her expressions while playing both the main characters are perfect. With Madhumati, she brings the wonder, surprise and innocence needed in the person. With Madhavi, she brings the poise, the curiosity and pity for the grief that Anand is going through\" and Karan Bali from Upperstall.com wrote that \"For Vyjayanthimala, the film showcases both her acting as well as dancing abilities and the dizzying success of Madhumati took Vyjayanthimala to the highest rungs of stardom[...]to cap off an extremely successful year for her. Both, as an actress of considerable dramatic merit and as a star\". Madhumati came to be known as the first film which dealt with the theme of reincarnation and had a gothic noir feel to it. The film later inspired films such as Milan (1967), The Reincarnation of Peter Proud (1975), Mehbooba (1976), Kudrat (1980), Karz (1980), Karan Arjun (1995) and particularly Om Shanti Om (2007) which had also lifted the film's climax which led to Rinki Bhattacharya, the late Roy's daughter accusing the film of plagiarism and threatening legal action against its producers. The same month she had another release, B. R. Chopra's Sadhna alongside Sunil Dutt. Vyjayanthimala was the second choice for the role of Champabai, the prostitute, after actress Nimmi who hesitated to play the role of a prostitute which arguably led to her career decline. The Filmfare award winning story by Mukhram Sharma revolves around Rajini, enacted by Vyjayanthimala, a prostitute's love affair with a professor, played by Sunil Dutt. Chopra who previously directed Vyjayanthimala in Naya Daur, had adapted the theme on the rehabilitation of prostitutes which was then a controversial topic in India. Along with the film her performance received universal acclaim, as told by Vijay Lokapally from The Hindu, \"Among the great movies made on the subject of helpless women versus society, Sadhna holds its own for its realistic portrayal and treatment of a subject, so aesthetically documented by Chopra and Vyjayanthimala\" and praised the latter \"gorgeous when she entertains the clients at her kotha[...]stunningly restrained when she assumes the character of a prospective wife\". Similarly, the Rediff's critic Dinesh Raheja has commented that \"But finally, the show belongs to Vyjayanthimala. Fetchingly frivolous in the first half, she is suitably serious in the second. She makes her need for acceptance palpable; her eyes emit twin lasers of anger and condemnation at those that exploit women\". Sadhna also performed well at the box office where it became fifth highest-grossing film of 1958 with trade pundits declaring the film a box-office hit. Subsequently, Vyjayanthimala received two Filmfare nominations in Best actress category for Madhumati and Sadhna, where she won her first ever Filmfare trophy for the latter after refusing to accept the Best Supporting Actress Award trophy for Devdas (1955) earlier. Her next release was Amar Deep where she was paired against Dev Anand for the first time. A production of Sivaji Ganesan's Sivaji Productions, the film was a remake of 1956 Tamil film Amara Deepam which had Ganesan himself in the lead. Along with Padmini who reprised her role from the original, Vyjayanthimala plays the role of Aruna which was originally performed by actress Savitri in Tamil.Her other releases of 1958 Sitaroan Ke Aage and Piya Milan became average success. In 2011, in conjunction with actor Dev Anand's death, Vyjayanthimala recollected her memories during the filming in Madras where she remembers the actor calling her \"Papa\", the Tamil termed that was used by her family and friends, and he would search for her throughout the sets while yelling \"where is Papa, where is my heroine\". According to Subhash Chheda, when Amar Deep was released, the long-awaited airing of Vyjayanthimala and Dev Anand was compared to the Madhubala and Dev Anand pair, where the public verdicted that \"\"If Madhubala brooks no equality, Vyjayanthimala admits no superiority\". Unfortunately, the film failed to turn Vyjayanthimala and Dev Anand team into a hit pair. The same year Vyjayanthimala was booked by M. G. Ramachandran for his second directorial venture Ponniyin Selvan. One of the first screen adaptation of Kalki Krishnamurthy's Ponniyin Selvan the film had a huge ensemble cast consisting of Gemini Ganesan, Padmini, Savitri, Saroja Devi, M. N. Rajam and Nagesh along with Ramachandran and Vyjayanthimala. In the film, she was given the role of Kundavai, the elder sister of Raja Raja Chola I, played by Ganesan and the wife of Vallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan, played by Ramachandran. However, in the mid of 1958 the film was shelved for unknown reasons. The same year she did another Tamil film Gemini Pictures's Magnum opus Vanjikottai Valiban along with Gemini Ganesan and Padmini. Written by Gemini Story Department which was headed by Kothamangalam Subbu, the Black-and-white epic film was produced and directed by S. S. Vasan. She played the role of Princess Mandakini, the beautiful princess of Ratna Island Kingdom. As a stubborn princess, she always wanted to achieve her ambition in any deed which led to her ultimate death and formed the climax. The film had a great theatrical run where the film completed 100 days run at cinemas and was labelled as blockbuster at box office. The film is still remembered for the dance of Vyjayanthimala and Padmini in the \"Kannum Kannum Kalanthu\" song which was choreographed by Hiralal and was well received by critics and audience alike wherein the popularity of the song surpassed the popularity garnered by the film. The song is still regarded as one of the best dance sequences in Indian cinema. Vanjikottai Valiban was followed by its Hindi version titled Raj Tilak. Screenplay of the film was by Ramanand Sagar. The film was directed by S. S. Vasan with Ganesan, Vyjayanthimala and Padmini in the lead. Within a week, the film sank at box office and was unable to achieve the same box office success made by the Tamil version. By the end of the year, The Indian Express named Vyjayanthimala as the most successful female star of 1958. Similarly, Boxofficeindia.com ranked Vyjayanthimala at the top spot in their list of \"Top Three Successful Box Office Actress of 1958\". In 1959, Vyjayanthimala reunited with Dilip Kumar for the fourth time in bilingual Paigham. Produced and directed by S. S. Vasan, the film featured the lead actors along with Raaj Kumar, B. Saroja Devi, Pandari Bai and Motilal. Besides them, Vyjayanthimala's real-life mother Vasunthara Devi also acted in a small role where she played the role of mother to her own daughter who died in vain. Upon release Paigham became second highest-grossing film of 1959 with a verdict of a box-office hit. The same year she did a Tamil film, Athisaya Penn where she co-starred with Telugu actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao for the first time. Athisaya Penn was a remake of Aasha which again was directed by M. V. Raman. She acted opposite Pradeep Kumar in romantic film Jawani Ki Hawa in 1959. In 1960, Vyjayanthimala mostly concentrated on Tamil films to keep in touch with the industry. Her first release in 1960 was S. S. Vasan's Irumbu Thirai, the Tamil version of Paigham. She starred opposite Sivaji Ganesan for the second time after the latter's cameo appearance in Marma Veeran (1956). Along with Vyjayanthimala, all the female cast including B. Saroja Devi, Pandari Bai and Vasunthara Devi reprised their role from the original with S. V. Ranga Rao in Motilal's role and K. A. Thangavelu in Raaj Kumar's character. The film was followed by Raja Bakthi again with Sivaji Ganesan. Raja Bakthi had huge ensemble cast featuring P. Bhanumathi, Padmini, T. S. Balaiah and E. V. Saroja. Her subsequent release was D. Yoganand's magnum opus Parthiban Kanavu. Co-starring Gemini Ganesan for the third time and B. Saroja Devi for the second time, the film was based on Kalki Krishnamurthy's 1942 novel with the same name. Apart from Tamil, the film was produced in Telugu and Sinhala languages. Upon release the film met with positive response from the critics and was awarded the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil at the 8th National Film Awards. However the film did not fare well at box office but Vyjayanthimala's performance was appreciated by critics. She also acted opposite M. G. Ramachandran for the first time in Baghdad Thirudan. Meanwhile, she did a Hindi film titled College Girl opposite Shammi Kapoor which fared average at box office and was declared as eighteenth highest-grossing film of the year. Following successful re-entry in Tamil cinema, Vyjayanthimala then signed Dilip Kumar's home production film Gunga Jumna. Having inspired by 1934 Manhattan Melodrama, the film was one of the first Bollywood films to deal with the theme based on two brothers on the opposite sides of law. Directed by Nitin Bose, she co-starred Kumar for the fifth time after Devdas, Naya Daur, Madhumati, Paigham. In this dacoit drama, she enacted the role of Dhanno, a washerwoman who falls for childhood friend Gunga, played by Kumar and eventually killed during a gun fight. To prepare herself for that role, Vyjayanthimala had to learn the Bhojpuri, a Hindi language dialect spoken by people in East India region. She was assisted by Kumar who chose the shade of saree that Vyjayanthimala would wear in every scene. Upon release the film opened to widespread critical acclaim from the critics. Her performance earned her rave reviews. Dinesh Raheja from Rediff said that \"Ganga Jamuna deployed several crowd-pleasing elements[...]most of all, an enchanting relationship between Dilip Kumar and Vyjayanthimala[...] Their characterisation ran so deep, which helped Dilip Kumar and Vyjayanthimala give magnetic performances. Dilip is of course a thespian but Vyjayanthimala is a revelation\" while K. K. Rai from Stardust applauded her performance by adding \"Vyjayanthimala played the village woman with such simplicity and grace; you\u2019d forget she was one of the most glamorous stars of her time. She also spoke the Bhojpuri dialect like a native\". Critics praised Vyjayanthimala for her ability to master the Bhojpuri dialect despite her South Indian upbringing. Subsequently, the film enjoyed huge success at box office across India. At the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed around \u20b9 70,000,000 with net gross of \u20b935,000,000 and a verdict of a blockbuster. The film was the Highest-grossing film of 1961 and was third highest grossing Hindi film of the decade behind Mughal-e-Azam and Sangam, another Kumar and Vyjayanthimala starer respectively. The film was ranked second by Boxofficeindia.co.in behind Mughal-e-Azam in their list of \"Top 50 Film of Last 50 Years\" which features all-time highest grossing Bollywood films by using the relative price of gold in different years to arrive at a hypothetical current value of box-office collections of past films with its adjustment to inflation rate. \u20b97.36 billion (US$110\u00a0million). For her performance Vyjayanthimala was awarded with the Filmfare Award for Best Actress trophy at the 9th Filmfare Awards. In addition to that, she also won her first ever Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards in the Best Actress category. In the same year, she starred in C. V. Sridhar's Nazrana. Remake of highly successful 1959 Tamil film Kalyana Parisu, again directed by Sridhar, she acted alongside Raj Kapoor for the first time.

The triangular love story received average run at the cinemas and ended as twelfth highest-grossing film of that year. The same year she did another film with Sridhar. Being the first Tamil film to be shot in Jammu and Kashmir, she acted alongside Gemini Ganesan after a long gap in Then Nilavu. The film and the soundtrack was widely appreciated by the audience where it was a huge success. The film was followed by J. Om Prakash's Aas Ka Panchhi with Rajendra Kumar. For her portrayal Vyjayanthimala got some negative feedback from the critics, The Hindu review said that \"Even the otherwise powerhouse of talent, Vyjayantimala, with many a sterling performance under her belt, barely passes muster, despite the usual dance and song sequence to showcase her formidable prowess as an accomplished dancer thrown in\". Despite some mixed reviews, the film was labelled as hit at box office and was declared as the fourth highest-grossing film of 1961 where it had a silver jubilee run at the theatres. Her career then struggled again with some box office duds in the following year. In 1962 she co-starred Manoj Kumar in Dr. Vidya which performed average at box office. Dr. Vidya was followed by two more box office disappointments, Rungoli with Kishore Kumar and Jhoola with Sunil Dutt. 1963 saw a steady decline in offers for her Tamil film career as Saroja Devi, Savitri, Bhanumati and Padmini were getting thebest roles. She co-starred with Sivaji Ganesan in Historical fiction Chittoor Rani Padmini. Written by C. V. Sridhar and directed by Chitrapu Narayana Rao, the film proved to be a box office failure, however her performance was critically acclaimed.The same year Bimal Roy who earlier worked with her in Devdas and Madhumati offered her the lead role in Bandini opposite Ashok Kumar and Dharmendra. However, Vyjayanthimala could not accept the role due to her busy schedule. The Boxofficeindia.com ranked Vyjayanthimala at Top spot in their list of \"Top Three Successful Box Office Actress\" of 1962 and 1963 respectively despite her box office failures. Following two years sabbatical, Vyjayanthimala re-attained her success in Bollywood through Raj Kapoor's first technicolor film Sangam. Termed as Kapoor's magnum opus, the film was produced at lavish budget by his production company R. K. Films. Earlier in the 1940s, Kapoor planned to launch Sangam in the title of Gharonda with Dilip Kumar and Nargis and himself in the lead, however the film was delayed for several times until 1962. Following Kumar and Dev Anand's refusal to be a part of the film, Kapoor then fixed Rajendra Kumar and himself as the male leads. Sangam was the first Indian film shot in Europe and outside of Asia. It was the longest running film in India when it was released at 238 minutes. The film also created a record by being the first film to have two cinema intervals. Cinematography by Radhu Kamarkar, the European filming locations include Venice, Paris, Switzerland and London while the Indian locations include Ooty and Kashmir Valley. Upon release the film was well received by critics and was considered as Bollywood's greatest love triangle. Vyjayanthimala's performance too was praised by critics. Dinesh Raheja of Rediff said that \"to put it simply, radiant[...]the maturity with which she tackles her character, the insouciance as well as the agony\" and call it as \"one of commercial cinema's most unforgettable performances\". Similarly, the film was commercially successful throughout India and other country as well. On its overall theatrical run, Boxofficeindia.com reported that the film had grossed \u20b98,00,00,000 and netted around \u20b940,000,000 with its adjusted to inflation nett gross is about \u20b9843,900,000 (US$13\u00a0million).

Sangam also had great box office run outside of India where it was well received in countries such as China, Malaysia and Russia. For her role Radha, who caught between her husband and her former lover, Vyjayanthimala was awarded with Filmfare Best Actress trophy. She then co-starred Dilip Kumar for the sixth time in Ram Mukherjee's Leader. The film was comeback film for Kumar whose last film was Gunga Jumna also with Vyjayanthimala. Like most of Vyjayanthimala and Kumar's film, their screen chemistry receives praises from the critics, where Deepak Mahan from The Hindu said \"What made the film even more enjoyable was the equally spirited response of doe-eyed Vyjayantimala, oozing oodles of impish charm in every frame. The pair carried the film on their shoulders, giving abundant joy and mirth to audiences with their outstanding histrionics. Their interactions make the film worth going miles to watch and it is certain that without their resolute shoulders\". However the film Leader did not fare well at the box office where it was labelled as below average. During the making of Leader, Rediff describe Vyjayanthimala as \"recalcitrant\" which annoyed Kumar. The film was followed by Gemini Film's Zindagi directed by Ramanand Sagar. A female centric film, it features Vyjayanthimala alongside Rajendra Kumar, Raaj Kumar and Prithviraj Kapoor. Zindagi becomes success at box office where it celebrated silver jubilee theatrical run and was fourth highest-grossing film of that year with verdict hit. Soon she signed for Anjali Pictures' Phoolon Ki Sej with Ashok Kumar and Manoj Kumar and this became her third consecutive hit of the year. Her last release in 1964 was Ishaara, in which she co-starred actor Joy Mukherjee for the first time and her performance ensured film was box office success. In 1965, Vyjayanthimala starred in two box office wise disappointing films Naya Kanoon with Ashok Kumar and Bharat Bhushan, Nam Iruvar with T. R. Mahalingam but both the's films are considered as masterpieces by critics. Naam Iruvar became her last Tamil film. In 1966, Vyjayanthimala starred in Do Dilon Ki Dastaan which failed at the box office. After some box office flops, Vyjayanthimala soon signed alongside Rajendra Kumar in the swashbuckler ruritanian romance Suraj. Directed by T. Prakash Rao, the film had Mumtaz, Bharathi Vishnuvardhan and Neetu Singh. Suraj was huge box office success and was one of the popular costume drama in Bollywood.

Following Suraj, Vyjayanthimala starred in the historical film Amrapali.

Upon release the film was opened to widespread critical acclaim and was India's official submission for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 39th Academy Awards. The film was huge colossal flop which left Vyjayanthimala heartbroken where she decided to quit the industry, though director Baldev Raj Chopra felt that she could have easily continued for another decade in lead roles. After Amrapali which was the biggest flop in her career and some personal issues with co-stars, Vyjayanthimala lost interest in films. In 1967, she was signed in Tapi Chanakya's Ram Aur Shyam which was a remake of 1964 Telugu film Ramudu Bheemudu. She co-starred Dilip Kumar for the seventh time who previously had made some memorable films with her. However, due to some misunderstanding between Kumar and Vyjayanthimala, Vyjayanthimala was replaced by Waheeda Rehman. The same year she starred in Vijay Anand's Jewel Thief after Saira Banu backed out of the project due to her marriage with Dilip Kumar. The crime thriller reunited Vyjayanthimala after a decade with her co-star Dev Anand after Amar Deep. Jewel Thief also had Ashok Kumar as the main antagonist with four more female leads Tanuja, Helen, Anju Mahendru and Faryal. For the first time she worked under Dev Anand's production house, the Navketan Films after being rejected by Tad Danielewski for the lead role in 1965 Hindi film Guide. The success of Jewel Thief made Vyjayanthimala and Dev Anand a hit pair. Three decades later, Vyjayanthimala was approached by Dev Anand for a role in the sequel of Jewel Thief, Return of Jewel Thief (1996), but she refused to act in the film as she did not planned to make a comeback. Subsequently, Vyjayanthimala's dance number in \"Hothon Pe Aisi Baat Main\" sung by Lata Mangeshkar becomes huge hit where it was considered as one of the best dance number in Indian cinema while being influential for the rises of other dance numbers such as \"Chamma Chamma\" and \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" from China Gate and Tees Maar Khan respectively. The same year she did the magnum opus Chhoti Si Mulaqat produced by Bengali actor Uttam Kumar.

Inspired by Banaphool's novel with the same, the film was directed by acclaimed director Tapan Sinha where Vyjayanthimala made her Bengali cinema debut through the film. She played the role of widowed young women - Chhipli - who falls for a civil surgeon Doctor Anandi Mukheerjee. Upon release the film received unanimously positive reviews where it was awarded with the Best Feature Film Award at the 15th National Film Awards while Vyjayanthimala's performance also appreciated by critics alike. A review from Upperstall had mentioned that, \"Vyjayantimala, in her debut in Bengali films is extremely convincing as the independent and vivacious tribal widow\". Similarly her singing in the song \"Shyam Tor Tore Tamal Tolay Boshe Thaki\" along with singer Hemanta Mukherjee received her praises where it was described as \"pleasant surprise\" in the same review. Hatey Bazarey was also received well commercially and was one of the successful Bengali film of the 1960s. In 1968, Vyjayanthimala appeared in three big budget film with high-profile actors such as Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand and Rajendra Kumar. Her first release in the year was Sunghursh, directed by Mere Mehboob (1963) fame Harnam Singh Rawail. She co-starred Dilip Kumar for the seventh and last time in her career with Balraj Sahni and Sanjeev Kumar in key roles. Originally offered to actress Sadhana, the role later went to Vyjayanthimala as the former suffers with her thyroid problem. Reportedly she did not exchange a word with Kumar while filming following their relationship broke up. Vyjayanthimala's enactment of a courtesan Laila-e-Aasma, she received positive feedback from the critics. Anuj Kumar form The Hindu said that \"Vyjayanthimala is graceful as ever. In a film dominated by men, Rawail made sure she had a substantial role. Her dances and Naushad\u2019s lilting tunes come as a welcome break to the sinewy tone imparted by Abrar Alvi and Gulzar\u2019s dialogues\". The role fetched her Best Hindi Actress Award at 25th Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards. Sunghursh was followed by Saathi directed by C. V. Sridhar. Remake of highly acclaimed Tamil film of 1961, Palum Pazhamum, the film had Rajendra Kumar and Simi Garewal replacing Sivaji Ganesan and Sowcar Janaki respectively from the Tamil version with Vyjyanthimala enacting the role originally portrayed by B. Saroja Devi. The same year she co-starred with Dev Anand for the third time and last time in T. Prakash Rao's Duniya. Duniya, Saathi and Sunghursh was named as tenth, eleventh and twelfth highest-grossing film of 1968 respectively, with the first two was labelled as average while the latter only managed to do above average business at box office. On the other hand, Duniya is considered as a hit film by some critics and often included in the hit film list of Dev Anand. All her films released from 1969, Pyar Hi Pyar, Prince and Ganwaar, became huge box office success. Ganwaar was her last Hindi film. Post her retirement in films, Vyjayanthimala was offered with many roles by big banners opposite leading actors of that time. But she refused all those offers as she does not want to make a comeback. In 1968, she was signed opposite Raj Kapoor in Mahesh Kaul's Sapno Ka Saudagar, she refused the role which went to the debutante Hema Malini, who become one of the biggest actress in Bollywood later. However, in 1975, Vyjayanthimala was almost signed in Gulzar's Aandhi with Sanjeev Kumar but she backed out from the project as the role resemble Indira Gandhi's personal life. Perhaps the most famous role that Vyjayanthimala ever turned down was the 1975 crime-drama film Deewar. Inspired by 1961 film Ganga Jumna, a Vyjayanthimala starer, the film was directed by Yash Chopra and features Amitabh Bachchan and Shashi Kapoor in the lead roles. She turned down the role of a mother for the lead actors which later went to Nirupa Roy who attained popularity through success of the film and later cast in similar roles. Following that, she refused the multi-starrer 1981 blockbuster film Kranti opposite Dilip Kumar with Manoj Kumar, Shashi Kapoor, Hema Malini, Shatrughan Sinha, Parveen Babi, Sarika as the ensemble cast which was directed and produced by Manoj Kumar himself. Apart from Hindi films, she refused the 1989 Tamil film Mappillai starring Rajinikanth. As said by Rajinikanth who played the lead role, \"actor Vyjayanthimala was first offered the role of mother-in-law in Maapilai which was a pivotal role, but she refused the film even though the producer of the film Chiranjeevi come forward to give her huge salary, she said that she does not want to play the role of antagonist opposite me and will never agree to be part of fighting scene against me\". Following many films refused by Vyjayanthimala, Dinesh Raheja from Rediff commented that \"good money and pivotal roles notwithstanding[...]did not seem alluring enough\". Vyjayanthimala's political career was initiated in 1984 when she contested in 1984 Tamil Nadu general election for the South Chennai constituency as the nominee of the Indian National Congress opposite Era Sezhiyan, the leader of Janata Party and seasoned parliamentarian. During the campaign, Sezhiyan took provoking quotes such as \"Send me to the Lok Sabha. Send her to R.R. Sabha (an organisation promoting fine arts)\" to defeat Vyjayanthimala, ironically she won the election with margin of about 48,000 votes where she gained 313,848 with percentage of 51.92%. Subsequently, she debuted in the Lok Sabha, the directly elected lower house of the Parliament of India by the end of January 1985 with Amitabh Bachchan. In 1989, Vyjayanthimala again had to face the 1989 Tamil Nadu general election, this time she was opposed by Aladi Aruna of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. She again beat her opposition by nearly 12584\u00a0 votes. Later in 1993, she was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India for a six-year term. In 1999, she has resigned from the primary membership of the Indian National Congress party. In her letter to the party's president Sonia Gandhi, she included the reason for her resignation where she said that, \"painfully watching the party drifting from its avowed principles after the death of Rajiv Gandhi. The party has lost touch with its grassroots and one can see day in and day out that sincere party workers are being steadily ignored\", she adds more, \"increasingly difficult to justify ourselves to the public and my conscience does not allow me to stay in the party any longer\". Later she joined the Bharatiya Janata Party on 6 September 1999. In her hey-days, Vyjayanthimala was the subject of many controversies, particularly for her relationship with her co-stars. In the early 1960s, Vyjayanthimala was linked by magazines with Dilip Kumar, who has acted with her the most compared to any other actress which resulted in great on-screen chemistry between them. While working for his home production Gunga Jumna (1961), it is said that Kumar handpicked the shade of sari that Vyjayanthimala would wear in every scene. In addition to that, film historians Bunny Reuben and Sanjit Narwekar have confirmed the Kumar & Vyjayanthimala's affair where they had said that Vyjayanthimala was Kumar's third love after Kamini Kaushal and Madhubala. In the early 1960s, actor Raj Kapoor had commenced the filming of Sangam with Vyjayanthimala playing the female lead along with Rajendra Kumar and Kapoor himself as male lead. The filming took four years to finish. During this time Vyjayanthimala is said to have been romantically involved with Kapoor and almost married him. Initially, she was vexed with him and kept him at a distance. However Kapoor did not give up over her attitude. This incident had made Kapoor's wife Krishna move out of her husband\u2019s house with their children. They checked into Natraj Hotel in Mumbai and stayed there for four and a half months as Krishna was disgusted with the affair.However Vyjayanthimala in her autobiography mentioned that it was the publicity stunt by newspapers in North India to link her with Raj Kapoor and Dilip Kumar and that she was never in any relationship with her co-stars. Vyjayanthimala married Chamanlal Bali in 1968. After marriage, she gave up her acting career and moved to Chennai.However between 1968 and 1970, she shot for those films which she had signed before her marriage, like Pyar Hi Pyar, Prince, Ganwaar. They have a son, Suchindra Bali. In 2007, she published her autobiography, titled Bonding, with Jyoti Sabarwal as co-writer. Vyjayanthimala is a Vaishnavite and a vegetarian. She grew up listening to holy chants and devotional songs. She is a devotee of Aandaal, one of the 12 Alvar saints of South India. She used to invoke Aandaal before any public performance to gain her blessing."

        "artist_name": "Waheeda_Rehman", 
        "biography": " Waheeda Rehman (born 3 February 1938) is an Indian actress who has appeared in mainly Hindi films, as well as Tamil, Bengali and Telugu films. She is noted for her contributions to different genres of films from the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s. She has received a Centenary Award for Indian Film Personality, a Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award, a National Film Award for Best Actress and two Filmfare Awards for Best Actress, throughout her career. She has been cited as the Bollywood's \"most beautiful\" actress by various media outlets, a title for which she has received substantial publicity. Rehman was born in Chengalpattu, Tamil Nadu, India. She was in her teens when her father died. Her dream was to become a doctor but, due to her family circumstances and her mother illness, she abandoned her goal. In order, to help her family, she hit the silver screen with Telugu films, Jayasimha (1955), followed by Rojulu Marayi (1955) and a Tamil film Kaalam Maari Pochu (1956). It is in Vijaya-Suresh's Ram aur Shyam (a remake of Telugu movie Ramudu Bheemudu) in 1967 that she acted again under the direction of the topnotch Telugu director Tapi Chanakya who incidentally directed her movies Rojulu Maaraayi in Telugu (1955) and Kaalam Maaripochu in Tamil (1956). Her first initial appearance in a Hindi film was in CID (1956). Later, she was seen in a series of successful films including Pyaasa (1957), 12 O'Clock (1958), Kaagaz Ke Phool (1959), Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam, Chaudhvin Ka Chand (1961). Her other notable works include Solva Saal (1958), Baat Ek Raat Ki (1962), Kohra (1964), Bees Sal Baad (1962), Guide (1965), Teesri Kasam, Mujhe Jeene Do (1966), Neel Kamal and Khamoshi (1969).   Waheeda Rehman was born into a Dakhini Muslim family in Chengalpattu, Tamil Nadu, India. She and her sister learnt Bharatnatyam in Chennai, where Guru Trichunder Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai and in Bombay Guru Jayalaxmi Alva, doyen among nattuvanars taught and performed on stage together. Her father, who was a district commissioner, died while she was in her teens. It is a common misconception that Rehman was born in Andra Pradesh .\"I was born in Chengalpattu, she reveals, I used to have a house in Chennai and agricultural land in the Red Hills area. So, why the widespread belief that she was born in Hyderabad? It's a long story, she says, When I was in Chennai, I did three to four Telugu movies. In the first one, Rojulu Maraayi, I did only a folk dance number. However, it went on to become a hit! I was in Hyderabad celebrating its success and Guru Dutt happened to be there. He was on a lookout for new faces and heard that I could speak in Urdu. It is because he spotted me in Hyderabad that people assume I was born there.\" Her dream was to become a doctor but, due to circumstances of illness, she abandoned this goal. Instead helped by her supportive parents, she hit the silver screen with Telugu films Rojulu Marayi (1955), followed by Jayasimha (1955) and Tamil film Kaalam Maari Pochu (1956). It is in Vijaya-Suresh's Ram aur Shyam (a remake of Telugu movie Ramudu Bheemudu) in 1967 that Waheeda acted again under the direction of the topnotch Telugu director Tapi Chanakya who incidentally directed her movies Rojulu Maaraayi in Telugu (1955) and Kaalam Maari Pochu in Tamil (1956) She made her debut in the films with Alibabvum 40 Thirudurgalum starring M.G.Ramachandran and P.Bhnumati in lead roles as a dancer, appearing in the number \"Salam Babu\". Waheeda Rehman, started her career in films in 1954 and her first successful films were the Telugu films Jayasimha (1955), Rojulu Marayi (1956) and Tamil film Kaalam Maari Pochu (1955). In the success party of Rojulu Maaraayi, Guru Dutt noticed her and decided to groom her and have her act in Hindi films. Waheeda considered Guru Dutt as her mentor. Dutt brought her to Bombay (now Mumbai) and cast as a vamp in his production CID (1956), directed by Raj Khosla. A few years after joining the Hindi film industry, she lost her mother. After the success of C.I.D., Dutt gave her a leading role in Pyaasa (1957). Their next venture together, Kaagaz Ke Phool (1959), depicted the story of a successful director's decline after he falls for his leading lady. Dutt's existing marriage and her film successes with other directors caused them to drift apart personally and professionally, although they continued to work together into the 1960s (Chaudhvin Ka Chand). She completed Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam (1962) under some strain. They broke away from each other after its indifferent reception at the Berlin Film Festival in 1963. Soon afterward, Guru Dutt died on 10 October 1964 in Mumbai reportedly from an overdose of sleeping pills and alcohol. Waheeda Rehman established a great working relationship with Dev Anand, and together as a pair had number of successful films to their credit. The box office hits of the pair include CID (1956), Solva Saal (1958), Kala Bazar (1960), Baat Ek Raat Ki (1962) and Guide (1965); box office duds were Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja (1961) and Prem Pujari (1970). She reached her peak with Guide (1965) and was much in demand. Rehman was cast as Gulabi in Satyajit Ray's Bengali film Abhijan in 1962. She worked in comedy film Girl Friend in 1960 with Kishore Kumar. She was offered lead actress's role in films even opposite actors junior to her by experience like Dharmendra, but they flopped. But she continued to taste success in the late sixties when she was paired with well established stars. She delivered hits opposite Dilip Kumar in three successive years; Dil Diyaa Dard Liyaa in 1966, Ram Aur Shyam in 1967 and Aadmi in 1968 and some box office duds but critically acclaimed films with Rajendra Kumar \u2013 Palki, Dharti and Shatranj\u00a0; two films opposite Raj Kapoor \u2013 Ek Dil Sau Afsane and the acclaimed Teesri Kasam which was the debut film of Basu Bhattacharyya; a few films opposite Biswajeet like, Bees Saal Baad and Kohra; this helped her continue to get lead roles in the early seventies. Her career's biggest hit Khamoshi came in 1970, opposite Rajesh Khanna. Her career continued throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. She won the Filmfare Best Actress Award for her roles in Guide (1965), where she hit the peak of her career, and Neel Kamal (1968), but despite excellent offbeat roles in subsequent films, including a National Award winning performance in Reshma Aur Shera (1971), some of the films failed at the box office. Seeing her films being successful, Waheeda decided to experiment with roles at this stage of career. She accepted Reshma Aur Shera, opposite her old co-star Sunil Dutt, with whom she had previously in the sixties had hits like Ek Phool Char Kaante, Mujhe Jeene Do, Meri Bhabhi and Darpan. Her performance was appreciated by critics, but the film failed at the box office. But Waheeda continued to experiment with roles and accepted the offer to play a mother to Jaya Bhaduri in Phagun (1973). This she regards the mistake of her career as after this film flopped suddenly people started offering her motherly roles to heroes. Film expert Rajesh Subramanian informs that Manmohan Desai had approached her on behalf of Shammi Kapoor during the making of Naseeb. In the song John jani janardhan, Shammi Kapoor and Waheeda Rehman make a grand entry holding hands. Incidentally this was the first time the two stars appeared together on screen. Later she also did Manmohan Desai's Coolie and Allah Rakha. From the mid seventies, Waheeda's career as lead heroine ended and her career as character actor began. At around this time, Kamaljit, who starred opposite her in Shagoon (1964), proposed and they got married in 1974. After her appearance in Lamhe (1991), she retired from the film industry for 12 years. In her new innings from seventies her successful films, where she played pivotal roles include, Kabhi Kabhie (1976),Trishul (1978), Jwalamukhi (1980), Namkeen and Namak Halaal (1982),Mashaal (1984), Chandni(1989), Rang De Basanti(2006). She played the central character in the Mahesh Bhatt directed film Swayam that starred Akash Khurana and Anupam Kher. She also appeared in a tele-series being directed by Gulzar. In recent years she made a comeback playing elderly mother and grandmother roles in Om Jai Jagadish (2002), Water (2005) and Rang De Basanti (2006), 15, Park Avenue and Delhi 6 (2009) which were all critically acclaimed. In October 2004, a Waheeda Rehman film retrospective was held at the Seattle Art Museum and the University of Washington where Waheeda participated in spirited panel and audience discussions on her most memorable films\u2014Pyaasa, Teesri Kasam and Guide\u2014although her most successful film is still considered to be Khamoshi, with costar Rajesh Khanna. After her marriage to Shashi Rekhi (screen name Kamaljeet) on 27 April 1974, she shifted to a farmhouse in Bangalore. She has two children named Sohail and Kashvi, who are writers.

        "artist_name": "Zeenat_Aman", 
        "biography": " Zeenat Aman (born November 19, 1951 in Bombay) is an Indian actress, model and beauty queen best known for her work in Hindi films during the 1970s and 80's. She won the Miss Asia Pacific 1970 title. She is the first South Asian woman to win the title. Upon making her debut in Bollywood, Zeenat Aman, along with Parveen Babi, was credited with making a lasting impact on the image of its leading actresses by introducing the modern look to Hindi cinema.   Zeenat Aman was born in Mumbai (then called Bombay) in 1951 to Amanullah Khan. Her father, Amanullah Khan, was related to the Bhopal State ruling family. He was a script writer who made the script for such movies as Mughal-e-Azam and Pakeezah. Amanullah Khan often wrote under the nom de plume 'Aman' which she later adopted as her second name on screen. He died when Aman was 13. Her mother remarried a German man called Heinz. Zeenat Aman's mother's name is Scinda (Vardhini) Heinz. Aman's mother obtained a German citizenship and took her to Germany where Zeenat Aman stayed temporarily. She returned to India when she turned 18. She is the cousin of actor Raza Murad and niece of actor Murad. Aman did her schooling in Panchgani and went to University of Southern California in Los Angeles for further studies on student aid but she could not complete her graduation. Upon her return to India, she first took up a job as a journalist for Femina and then later on moved on to modeling. One of the first few brands that she modeled for was Taj Mahal Tea in 1966. She was the second runner up in the Miss India Contest and went on to win the Miss Asia Pacific in 1970. After having studied in Los Angeles, winning the Miss Asia Pacific 1970 contest and a successful modeling career, Aman's film career began with a small role in O.P. Ralhan's Hulchul in 1971. A second role in Hungama (1971), starring singer Kishore Kumar where both films were not successful and she was ready to pack her bags to leave India and was ready to leave to Malta with her mother and step father. Dev Anand offered Zaheeda (his second heroine in Prem Pujari) the role of his sister in Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971). Not realizing the importance of this secondary role, Zaheeda wanted the lead female part (eventually played by Mumtaz) and she opted out. Zeenat Aman was chosen as a last-minute replacement. In Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Zeenat Aman, aided by R. D. Burman song Dum Maro Dum (Take Another Take), won over the hearts of audience as Janice. She earned a Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award and BFJA Award for Best Actress. Throughout the 1970s, the Dev-Zeenat pairing was seen in half a dozen films: Heera Panna (1973), Ishq Ishq Ishq (1974), Prem Shastra (1974), Warrant (1975), Darling Darling (1977) and Kalabaaz (1977). Of these, Warrant, was the biggest box-office success. Her hip looks in Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973) as the girl carrying a guitar, singing Churaliya hai tumne jo dil ko (in Asha Bhosle's voice) has won her more popularity and the hearts of millions of fans. She appeared on every Hindi film magazine's cover during the 1970s. In December 1974, Cine Blitz magazine was launched with Zeenat Aman on its cover, a testimony to her popularity at the time. However, she went on as the favourite cover girl of the popular magazine 'Stardust'. Zeenat Aman, in her career and her success with Navketan Films and Dev Anand, found success with other banners such as B.R. Chopra, Raj Kapoor, Manmohan Desai, Feroz Khan, Nasir Hussain, Manoj Kumar, Prakash Mehra, Raj Khosla and Shakti Samanta. In 1978, she starred in Raj Kapoor's massively publicised Satyam Shivam Sundaram (1978), however, the film was heavily criticized. The subject ironically dealt with the notion of the soul being more attractive than the body but Kapoor chose to showcase Aman's sex-appeal. The actress was highly criticized for her exposure but somehow at later stage, the film had a great deal to do with Aman's fame and the movie itself was distinguished as a work of art. She also earned a Filmfare nomination as Best Actress for this film. Aman's entry into Hollywood also backfired when Krishna Shah's Shalimar (1978), co-starring Dharmendra and international names like Rex Harrison, John Saxon and Sylvia Miles, proved to be a failure in the United States and in India. Aman possessed a convent schoolgirl accent and a penchant for revealing dresses. She matched Gina Lollobrigida in the battle of oomph at Shalimar's launch. 1978 could have been a disaster year for her, because of the diminishing box office returns of Shalimar and discouraging critics riviews of Satyam Shivam Sundaram but Aman had other successful commercial films during that year such as Heeralal Pannalal and Chor Ke Ghar Chor, yet it was Don that came to the rescue with its huge success. Ironically, her reasons for accepting the role in Don were altruistic and she didn't even take any remuneration for it because she wanted to help the producer Nariman Irani who died midway filming. Her role of a Westernized revenge-seeking action heroine contributed to the film's huge success and her fans reconnected with her again. Westernized heroines like Parveen Babi and Tina Munim now followed in her footsteps by the late 1970s. Aman continued to act in hits like Dharam Veer, Chhaila Babu and The Great Gambler. By the beginning of the 1980s, multi-starrer films became a trend and Zeenat Aman was increasingly asked to just provide sex appeal in hero-oriented films, despite success in so many films. In contrast to this trend was her performance as a rape victim seeking justice in B. R. Chopra's Insaaf Ka Tarazu (1980) for which she received a Filmfare Best Actress nomination. This film was followed by success in the love triangle Qurbani (1980 film), Alibaba Aur 40 Chor, Dostana (1980) and Lawaaris (1981). Aman's popularity in Russia was so great after Alibaba Aur 40 Chor that she felt pressured into doing a supporting role in Sohni Mahiwal. The film was moderately successful but no credit went to Aman.[citation needed] Her last role as the female lead was in the movie Gawahi, a court room drama in 1989. Aman came back to the silver screen after a decade doing a cameo role in the film Bhopal Express (1999). Aman went on to do roles in Boom (2003), Jaana... Let's Fall in Love (2006), Chaurahen (2007), Ugly Aur Pagli (2008), Geeta in Paradise (2009),Dunno Y... Na Jaane Kyon (2010) and \"Strings of Passion\" (2012). In 2004, she appeared as Mrs. Robinson in the play The Graduate staged at St Andrew's auditorium in Mumbai. Zeenat Aman had a TV show called In Conversation with Zeenat made by B4U TV and also made an appearance along with Hema Malini in the popular show Koffee with Karan hosted by Karan Johar. She received a Lifetime Achievement Award during the Zee Cine Awards function in 2008 as a recognition of her contribution to Hindi Cinema. She also received An Outstanding Contribution to Indian Cinema award at IIFA awards 2010 held at Colombo, Sri Lanka. She dedicated this award to her mother. Zeenat Aman's persona was a contrast to many of the more conservative stars of the era. At a time when heroines were obedient wives and lovers on the screens of Hindi Cinema, Aman was drawn to more unconventional roles\u2014she was cast as the opportunist who deserts her jobless lover for a millionaire (Roti Kapda Aur Makaan), the ambitious girl who considers having an abortion in order to pursue a career (Ajnabee), the happy hooker (Manoranjan), the disenchanted hippie (Hare Rama Hare Krishna), the girl who falls in love with her mother's one-time lover (Prem Shastra) and a woman married to a caustic cripple but involved in an extramarital relationship (Dhund). She managed to balance these roles with acting in more conventional films such as Chori Mera Kaam, Chhaila Babu, Dostana and Lawaaris, which is considered by many to be a landmark in Indian Cinema. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's \"Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema\" wrote, \"Zeenat Aman had a definite impact on the characterization of the heroine in Hindi films. With films such as Hare Rama Hare Krishna and Yaadon Ki Baraat, she fashioned the image of the youthful and westernized woman in Hindi cinema.\" Zeenat Aman's persona was such that newcomers were and still are compared to her. Parveen Babi was called \"The poor man's Zeenat Aman\", Sarika was christened \"Zeenat Aman 2\", Padmini Kolhapure was named \"Baby Zeenat\", and more recently, Bipasha Basu was referred to as the \"new age Zeenat\". In 1985, she married Mazhar Khan and had two sons Azaan and Zahaan. Mazhar Khan died in September 1998 of renal failure. Today, Zeenat Aman lives with her two sons and makes many social appearances and film awards functions."
