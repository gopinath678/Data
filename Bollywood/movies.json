        "full_text": " 1942: A Love Story is a 1994 Bollywood film starring Anil Kapoor, Manisha Koirala, Jackie Shroff, Anupam Kher, Danny Denzongpa, and Pran. The film was the first ever to be given a U/A rating while featuring a scene, previously considered inappropriate for young children, showing the actors kissing. The film was highly acclaimed for its music, songs, picturization, cinematography, lyrics and the portrayal of its leading lady Manisha Koirala, a turning point for her career. The film was released some time after the death of the music director, Rahul Dev Burman. The film received nine Filmfare Awards. This is the first Indian film to use Dolby Stereo. The movie was reported to be inspired by the 1992 Kannada movie Mysore Mallige.   The film is set in 1942, when the British Raj was declining. It was a time when many Indians were either working for the British or rallying in underground meetings and protests against them. In this atmosphere, Naren Singh (Anil Kapoor) falls in love with Rajeshwari \"Rajjo\" Pathak (Manisha Koirala). Their romance is shown developing in spite of the political and social unrest at the time. Naren's father, Diwan Hari Singh (Manohar Singh), is a loyal British employee, while Rajjo's father Raghuvir Pathak (Anupam Kher) is a revolutionary fighting against British rule. When Naren asks Raghuvir for Rajjo's hand in marriage, Raghuvir gets livid. Naren declares that he is willing to sacrifice everything for Rajjo, and convinces Raghuvir of his love for her. Pathak relents and tells Naren to talk to his father. When Naren does so, Hari Singh is angry that his son has chosen Rajjo, the daughter of a revolutionary, but pretends that he will do anything for Naren's happiness. Hari Singh tricks Naren into revealing Pathak's secret location, and leaks the information to the British authorities. Soon, police barge into Pathak's hideaway and try to kill him, only to find him waiting to light a bomb. He kills them all, dying with them. Rajjo, who was out at that time, realizes what has happened and runs away. She is taken into refuge by Shubhankar (Jackie Shroff), a compatriot of Pathak who has learned of his death. Under Shubhankar's tutelage, Rajjo follows her father's revolutionary path. Meanwhile, Naren is angry with his father for being used as a pawn in the ambush and killing of Pathak and driving Rajjo away. Promising to make up with Rajjo and help her cause, he pledges to become a protester or a revolutionary, opposing his own father. Naren severs all ties with his father and stands up against British rule, in particular General Douglas, in front of the city. He is convicted and sentenced to hang for attempted murder. Moved by Naren's actions, Rajjo tells Shubhankar about him. Shubhankar saves Naren from being hanged and the two finish off Hari Singh and many of the British loyalists. They are helped by Major Bisht (Danny Dengzongpa), who has a change of heart after having tragically witnessed the killing of his daughter Chanda, a revolutionary, by the gunshots of British loyalists upon General Douglas' orders. With the loyalists dead, Shubhankar hangs General Douglas by the same noose that was intended for Naren. Shubhankar, Rajjo and Naren, together with Major Bisht and the citizens are shown at the end of the movie saluting the Indian flag, being hoisted by Shubhankar. The film's music was composed by music director R.D. Burman with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. R.D. Burman won his last Filmfare Award for Best Music Director and Javed Akthar bagged the Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist. Kumar Sanu won his 5th consecutive Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer and Kavita Krishnamurthy won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer, the first of her Hat-trick feat. The music in the introduction of the film is from Gustav Holst's 'The Planets - Mars the bringer of war'. The film's adjusted gross amounts to Rs 896.4\u00a0million and was declared \"average\".",

Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama awarded the film 4.5 out of 5 stars, and noted, \"On the whole, 2 States is one of the finest movies to come out of the Hindi film industry of late. This is one of those rare Hindi movies that commands a repeat viewing. Strongly recommended!\" Critic Saurabh Dwiwedi, writing for India Today, gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, and published, \"2 States can be a good mirror for parents to understand their children. So take along your parents and enjoy the film.\" Meena Iyer of The Times of India gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, and wrote, \"What makes 2 States work is the simple narrative told humorously. Adapted as it is, from one of author Chetan Bhagat's best-selling works, the film, just like the book before it, is light-hearted. Chetan's funny one-liners and life-view are studiously borrowed by the director for his screen outing. And though there is a sense of deja-vu, for those who have read the book, the movie still manages to charm and surprise.\" Paloma Sharma of Rediff.com gave the movie 3.5 out of 5 stars and opined, \"There's nothing that should keep you from watching 2 States\". Mohar Basu of Koimoi gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and wrote, \"2 States is barely unwatchable but misses the magic of Chetan Bhagat\u2019s novel. As a stand alone, it is endearingly done with Alia and Arjun\u2019s scorching chemistry coming off as adorable. The Bhagat fan in me is disappointed but the cinegoer isn\u2019t.\" DNA posted, the first half of the film is light and breezy and the second dramatic and emotional, perhaps a better balance would have helped the post interval portion which seems heavy. Hindustan Times' Anupama Chopra gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5, and said, \"In 2 States, the story is the weakest link. The film is bolstered by talented actors, gorgeous songs by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, nice styling, sumptuous production design and a few sparkling moments. But in the second half, 2 States falls apart. At almost two-and-a-half hours, it\u2019s also stretched so thin that by the time Krish and Ananya walk into the sunset, you are long past caring\". Concerning Kapoor and Bhatt, she said, \"Arjun, departing from his earlier violent roles, makes a nicely goofy and later subdued lover boy, but it\u2019s Alia who lights up the screen.\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, and wrote, \"2 States is a cross-culture love story that strives to be sweet, funny and emotionally wrenching all at once. It is occasionally funny and sweet in parts all right, but the family drama at the film\u2019s core has a severely stultified feel. The trouble is that the impending wedding remains impending far too long to sustain interest... it sets out to be a slice-of-life drama about a real couple grappling with the politics of inter-community marriage, but it fails to generate enough energy and warmth to draw the audience into a tight clinch\". Shubra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, and said, \"2 States... sets out to be a solid, emotionally satisfying rom com, and goes well for a bit but then turns into a too-stretched-out \u2018jhagda\u2019 between the two sets of North-South parents. The smooth, engaging first half descends, post-interval, into mopey melodrama, and I got impatient waiting for the inevitable resolution.\" She praised Bhatt's performance, saying, \"...Alia Bhatt is a surprise. She leaves behind her earlier films, and gets into her character: she may not be an authentic \u2018Southie\u2019 in terms of body language, but she is all girl, easy and fresh and natural\".",

        "full_text": " 3 Idiots is a 2009 Indian coming of age comedy drama film co-written, edited, and directed by Rajkumar Hirani and produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra. Abhijat Joshi wrote the screenplay. It was inspired by the novel Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat. The film stars Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor, R. Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Omi Vaidya, Parikshit Sahni and Boman Irani. Upon release, the film was the highest-grossing film in its opening weekend in India and had the highest opening day collections for an Indian film up until that point. It also held the record for the highest net collections in the first week for a Bollywood film. It also became one of the few Indian films to become successful at the time in East Asian markets such as China, eventually bringing its overseas total to more than US$65 million at the time\u2014the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time in overseas markets, before being overtaken by Chennai Express in 2013. The film is distinctive for featuring real inventions by little-known people in India's backyards. The brains behind the innovations were Remya Jose, a student from Kerala, who created the pedal operated washing-machine; Mohammad Idris, a barber from Hasanpur Kalan in Meerut district in Uttar Pradesh, who invented a bicycle-powered horse clipper; and Jahangir Painter, a painter from Maharashtra, who made the scooter-powered flour mill. The subtitled version of the film grew popular in South Asia, especially China, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. This film was remade in Tamil as Nanban (2012) which also received critical praise and commercial success. It has also been announced that there will be a Chinese remake of the film produced by Stephen Chow and that there are plans for a Hollywood remake produced in the United States. A Telugu remake was planned despite Nanban having a Telugu dubbed version titled Snehitudu. 3 Idiotas a Mexican remake will be released in 2017.   Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) are students at the prestigious Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) who also share a room at the institution's dormitories. Farhan's passion is wildlife photography, but he pursues an engineering degree to appease his father. Raju chooses engineering with hopes of improving his family's financial situation, but his lack of self-confidence results in poor grades. Their third roommate and friend, Ranchodas \"Rancho\" Chanchad (Aamir Khan), has an immense interest in engineering, and invents in his spare time. After giving unorthodox answers in class, Rancho faces scrutiny from the college's director, Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), known as \"Virus\", whose traditional philosophies on education and learning contrast sharply with Rancho's atypical ideas of teaching. Virus is shown to be extremely strict \u2014 a trait that indirectly caused his own son's suicide after putting him under excessive pressure. Rancho eventually falls in love with Pia (Kareena Kapoor), Virus' younger daughter, who is a medical student in residency at the city's hospital. Rancho always scores the highest marks on exams out of his class, much to the dismay of both Virus and Chatur Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya), an arrogant Ugandan-born Tamil student who believes in rote learning, and dislikes Rancho, Farhan, and Raju. One night, Rancho, Farhan, and Raju drunkenly break into the Sahastrabuddhe household to allow Rancho to profess his love to Pia. After discovering their antics, Virus threatens to expel Raju unless he writes a letter blaming Rancho for the break-in. Unwilling to betray Rancho or disappoint his family, Raju unsuccessfully attempts suicide, and ends up in a coma. After intensive care and support from his friends, Raju recovers just before he successfully interviews for a corporate job. Before this Rancho and Pia post Farhan's letter to his favorite photographer. Farhan gets a positive response but fears his father. Rancho then convinces him to go confront his father and his father reluctantly agrees to it. Unfortunately, Virus gets frustrated at Rancho's influence on Raju and Farhan after knowing all these, and he conspires to deliberately modify the final exams and make it so difficult so that none of them can graduate. However, Pia gives Virus' office duplicate keys to Rancho to enable him to get the exam papers. But Virus finds the trio and expels them. The trio, however, earn a reprieve when Virus' pregnant elder daughter Mona (Mona Singh) goes into labour at the same time a heavy storm cuts off all power and traffic. Despite this, Rancho uses his engineering knowledge to deliver the baby in the college common room. A grateful Virus finally acknowledges Rancho as an extraordinary student, and allows the three to graduate. Rancho then unexpectedly disappears shortly after the ceremony. None of them have heard from Rancho since graduation. Ten years later, Farhan is a successful wildlife photographer, Raju is doing corporate job and settled in a comfortable lifestyle with his wife and Chatur Ramalingam is a vice president of a corporation in the United States. In present day Farhan is boarding for a flight. Suddenly he gets a call from Chatur telling him that he found Rancho. Farhan causes an emergency landing by faking a heart attack. On the way to the campus, he takes Raju and reaches the campus only to find Chatur but not Rancho. Chatur reveals that Rancho is in Shimla. Arriving at Shimla, they meet a man with the same name (Javed Jaffrey). From him, they learn that the Rancho they knew was actually \"Chhote\", an orphaned servant to the Chanchad family household in Shimla. When the real Ranchodas went to London for four years, his father allowed the servant to fill his son's place - including using his son's full name - and take credits for the degree. Ranchodas gives the address of \"Chhote\" in Ladakh, where he is a school teacher. On the way, the three rescue Pia from her arranged wedding with Suhas Tandon (Olivier Sanjay Lafont) at Manali so that Pia could marry \"Rancho\". Upon arrival in Ladakh, the four find the village school where they see young students' inventions resembling Rancho's own college projects. Raju, Farhan, and Pia then happily reunite with Rancho on a sandbar, where Rancho and Pia kiss. Assuming Rancho to just be a school teacher, Chatur forces him to concede that he is less successful than Chatur. Shortly after, Rancho reveals that he became a scientist while also teaching young children when he's not researching, and that his real name is Phunsukh Wangdu. Much to Chatur's horror, this also happens to be the name of an important inventor and business magnate that Chatur had spent a year trying to find and sign a business deal with. Principal photography began on 28 July 2008. Hirani and his team left in late August for the shoot with the principal cast. The film was shot in Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Ladakh, Chail and Shimla. Aamir and rest of the cast began shooting in early September. Hirani planned to wrap up the film by December. The first scene was shot in an aircraft with Madhavan. From Mumbai, the crew and cast comprising Aamir and Kareena went to Ladakh for a 20-day schedule. Filming of the ICE college scenes took place at the Indian Institute of Management\u00a0\u2013 Bangalore campus for 33 days as a part of the second schedule of production. The film's soundtrack is composed by Shantanu Moitra with lyrics penned by Swanand Kirkire. The film initially opened up on 2000 prints worldwide. 3 Idiots was released in 1800 theaters in India, which was at that time a big domestic release. 3 Idiots was released in 415 screens overseas. 3 idiots was released in 2,215 theaters worldwide. Subhash K. Jha stated: \"It's not that 3 Idiots is a flawless work of art. But it is a vital, inspiring and life-revising work of contemporary art with some heart imbued into every part. In a country where students are driven to suicide by their impossible curriculum, 3 Idiots provides hope. Maybe cinema can't save lives. But cinema, sure as hell, can make you feel life is worth living. 3 Idiots does just that, and much more. The director takes the definition of entertainment into directions of social comment without assuming that he knows best.\" Nikhat Kazmi of the Times of India gave it four and a half stars and suggests that, \"The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas [\u2026] Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munna Bhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track.\" Mayank Shekhar of the Hindustan Times gave the film three and a half out of five stars and comments that \"this is the sort of movie you\u2019ll take home with a smile and a song on your lips.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 3 Idiots four and a half out of five stars and states: \"On the whole, 3 Idiots easily ranks amongst Aamir, Rajkumar Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra's finest films. Do yourself and your family a favour: Watch 3 Idiots. It's emotional, it's entertaining, it's enlightening. The film has tremendous youth appeal and feel-good factor to work in a big way.\" Kaveree Bamzai of India Today gave 3 Idiots five stars and argues that \"it's a lovely story, of a man from nowhere who wanted to learn, told like a fairy tale, with the secret heart carrying its coded message of setting all of us free.\" Sonia Chopra of Sify gave the film 3 stars and said \"Though a bit too calculated and designed, 3 Idiots is still an ok option for the significant message, interesting cast and scattered breezy moments.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film three out of five stars and states: \"Going home after watching 3 Idiots I felt like I'd just been to my favorite restaurant only to be a tad under-whelmed by their signature dish. It was a satisfying meal, don't get me wrong, but not the best meal I'd been expecting.\" Shubhra Gupta from The Indian Express also gave it 3 stars, stating \"\u20183 Idiots' does not do as much for me. The emotional truth that shone through both the 'Munnabhai' movies doesn\u2019t come through strongly enough.\" Raja Sen of Rediff gave the film two out of five stars and states: \"Rajkumar Hirani's one of the directors of the decade, a man with immense talent and a knack for storytelling. On his debut, he hit a hundred. With his second, he hit a triple century. This time, he fishes outside the offstump, tries to play shots borrowed from other batters, and hits and misses to provide a patchy, 32*-type innings. It's okay, boss, *chalta hai*. Even Sachin has an off day, and we still have great hope.\" The film has received praise overseas. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 100% \"fresh\" critics' rating based on six reviews. Derek Elley of Variety wrote that \"3 Idiots takes a while to lay out its game plan but pays off emotionally in its second half.\" Robert Abele of Los Angeles Times wrote that there's an \"unavoidable joie de vivre (symbolized by Rancho's meditative mantra 'All is well') and a performance charm that make this one of the more naturally gregarious Bollywood imports.\" Louis Proyect described it as a \"fabulous achievement across the board. A typical Bollywood confection but also social commentary on a dysfunctional engineering school system that pressures huge numbers of students into suicide.\" The Korean site Naver gave the film a review rating of 9.4 out of 10. It was expected to be the first Indian film to be officially released on YouTube on 25 March 2010, only 12 weeks after its initial theatrical release. Officially, it was released on YouTube in May 2012, but its access has since been restricted. The film also went on to win many awards, winning six Filmfare Awards including best film and best director, ten Star Screen Awards and sixteen IIFA awards. After its initial run, the film's adjusted worldwide lifetime gross was \u20b9339 crore (equivalent to \u20b9597\u00a0crore or US$92\u00a0million in 2016). According to Box Office, 3 Idiots grossed \u20b911.92 billion (equivalent to \u20b921\u00a0billion or US$320\u00a0million in 2016) worldwide at the end of its theatrical run. The film was listed in Guinness World Records for the record of highest box office film gross for a Bollywood film. The film broke all box office records upon release. It created the highest collection record for paid previews with Rs 27.5\u00a0million that time, which was broken by Chennai Express (2013). In its four-day first weekend, the film netted \u20b938 crore (equivalent to \u20b967\u00a0crore or US$10\u00a0million in 2016), and broke the record held by Ghajini for the first weekend collections. By the first week, the film netted \u20b979 crore (equivalent to \u20b9139\u00a0crore or US$22\u00a0million in 2016), again breaking the box office record held by Ghajini. 3 Idiots had nett grossed \u20b956 crore (equivalent to \u20b999\u00a0crore or US$15\u00a0million in 2016) in its 2nd week, \u20b9302.5 million (US$4.7\u00a0million) during the third week, \u20b916 crore (equivalent to \u20b928\u00a0crore or US$4.4\u00a0million in 2016) in its fourth week and \u20b99.75 crore (equivalent to \u20b917\u00a0crore or US$2.7\u00a0million in 2016) in fifth to make a total of \u20b9202 crore (equivalent to \u20b9356\u00a0crore or US$55\u00a0million in 2016) in five weeks, first Indian film ever to collect this huge amount, hence established the \u20b9200 crore (US$31\u00a0million) Club. 3 Idiots became the then highest-grossing Bollywood film in overseas markets and now[when?] it ranks 4th with overseas gross of US$25\u00a0million. 3 Idiots first weekend opening collection in overseas was $4\u00a0million. It set record collections for Indian-produced films in territories such as United States, Australia, Fiji, and some African territories.[citation needed] In the United States, the film earned $6.5\u00a0million since its opening, in addition to over $2.5\u00a0million in the United Kingdom, over $2\u00a0million in Canada, nearly $1\u00a0million in Australia, and over $3\u00a0million in South Korea. 3 Idiots has the biggest first week total in US with around $3\u00a0million over its first four days. Unusual for an Indian film, 3 Idiots has become a major success in East Asian markets. The film had the longest showing period at cinemas in Taiwan, for more than two months from December 2010, breaking the record of Avatar, with over TWD $10\u00a0million grossed. The film was the first aired Indian film in Hong Kong, where it grossed HKD $22\u00a0million since its showing from 1 September 2011, as of January 2012, and the equivalent of over US$3\u00a0million as of 4 March 2012. In China, where it is known as San Geshagua (\"Three Idiots\"), the film grossed \u20b911 crore in 2 weeks in December 2011, eventually crossing the $2\u00a0million mark within 18 days, and nearly $3\u00a0million within a month, as of 5 January 2012. Alongside the original Hindi version, a Chinese-dubbed version was also released, with the popular actress Tang Wei (best known for Lust, Caution) voicing Kareena Kapoor's role. One reason for its success in East Asian markets such as China and Hong Kong is because of their similar education systems, thus many students were able to identify with the characters, with some Chinese universities \"even prescribing the film in their coursework as a kind of stress-relief in their classrooms.\" 3 Idiots added US$7\u00a0million from a wide release in far eastern markets like South Korea, China, Hong Kong etc. Following its success in other Asian markets, Japanese distributor Nikkatsu has announced plans to release the film in Japan. Upon its release in Japanese markets in June 2013, it went on to collect around \u00a5100\u00a0million (61\u00a0million) in its first two weeks of run\u00a0\u2013 That makes the film the highest grossing Hindi film ever in Japan. The film won 52 accolades; among these are five Filmfare Awards including best film and best director, ten Star Screen Awards, sixteen IIFA Awards, three National Film Awards, five GIMA Awards, two Apsara Awards and seven Bollywood Hungama Surfers Choice Movie Awards. In January 2014, it was nominated in the Best Outstanding Foreign Language Film category for 37th Japanese Academy Awards. Latika Gupta in an article published in the weekly journal Economic and Political Weekly mentions that the film has serious problems when seen from the gender perspective, in particular that it follows the trend set by the 2007 film Jab We Met in their use of women's sexual vulnerability to create sensation and humor. In a scene of the movie, students, professors and the chief guest are seen bursting with laughter hearing a speech where the word balatkar (rape) figures 21 times and the word stan (breast) four times. Prior to the release of the film director Rajkumar Hirani commented on the relationship between Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat and 3 Idiots stating: The day after the film opened, Chetan also noted: A controversy developed a few days after the release, however, over the fact that Chetan's credit, \"Based on the novel Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat\" appeared in the closing credits rather than in the opening ones. At that time, Bhagat stated that he \"was expecting an opening credit and I was quite surprised on not seeing it. They had bought the rights, made the payment and committed to a credit in the contract. It\u2019s there, but it\u2019s not about it being there, it\u2019s about the placement and the prominence.\" In a 31 December 2009 blog post on his personal website, Bhagat stated that he was told the movie was only 2\u20135% based on the book, but when he saw it, he felt that it was 70% of the book. He also argued that he was misled by the makers of the film, though he noted, that \"this has nothing to do with Mr Aamir Khan [\u2026] I am a big fan of Aamir and he has made my story reach people. However, he was told by the makers not to read the book, and he hasn\u2019t. Thus, he cannot comment on the issue in a meaningful manner.\" A few people responded to Chetan's statements. According to the Indo-Asian News Service (IANS), during a press conference with reporters producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra \"clarified that in the agreement between the producer and Bhagat, it was clearly mentioned that the author\u2019s name would be put in the closing credits.\" IANS also reported that Chopra \"lost his cool\" and \"asked a reporter to shut up after being questioned whether his hit 3 Idiots was lifted from author Chetan Bhagat\u2019s book Five Point Someone.\" Chopra later apologised, stating: \"I really think I\u2019m silly. I was provoked, but I shouldn\u2019t have done this. I saw myself on TV and saw how I was shouting 'shut up, shut up' like an animal. I told myself\u00a0\u2014 'what nonsensical behaviour'.\" Aamir Khan also responded to these claims. Rajkumar Hirani stated that \"We have officially bought the rights for the film. We drew a contract with him and it clearly mentions about the position of his credit. With open eyes he had seen the contract, consulted his lawyer and signed the agreement [\u2026] In the contract, we have said that the title would be given in the rolling credits. We haven't changed the font size. We haven't increased the speed of the title. It's exactly there where it was agreed to be.\" Chetan Bhagat later apologised stating, \"I definitely do not have anything against team 3 Idiots. I may have some issues on the mistake they may have made but nothing about their personality or the kind of people they are. I apologise to their families if there was any distress caused to them. I also want to thank all my fans, who stood by me but I don't want them to turn against anyone especially Aamir.\" This film was remade into Tamil entitled Nanban, in January 2012. Its dubbed version in Telugu, Snehithudu, released on 26 January 2012 in Andhra Pradesh to positive reviews. A Mexican remake named 3 Idiotas will be released in 2017. Following the success of 3 Idiots in East Asian markets such as China and Hong Kong, the producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra has announced that Hong Kong film star Stephen Chow (known for comedy films such as Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle) will be producing a Chinese remake of the film. Chopra also announced that there are plans for a Hollywood remake, and is in talks with three different American studios interested in remaking the film. Chopra also stated that there is an Italian film studio also interested in remaking the film. When asked about plans of a 3 Idiots sequel in an interview with Hindustan Times, screenwriter Abhijat Joshi replied, saying, \"Honestly, I don\u2019t know. We have an idea for the 3 Idiots sequel, a Munna Bhai part three, and also for a PK sequel; but the PK and Munna Bhai sequels interest me the most. So, I think the 3 Idiots sequel may happen in the future, but these two I really want to work on.\"  In January 2016, director Rajkumar Hirani and actor Aamir Khan confirmed that they were considering a 3 Idiots sequel. Khan told reporters, \"\u201cRaju Hirani has given me a hint about \u20183 Idiots\u2019 sequel and I am giving you all a hint. The film will happen if and whenever he will write the script.\u201d Hirani agreed, saying \" this is one film that I really want to do.\" ",

        "full_text": " 7 Khoon Maaf (read as Saat Khoon Maaf, released internationally as Seven Sins Forgiven) is a 2011 Indian black comedy film directed, co-written and co-produced by Vishal Bhardwaj. The film stars Priyanka Chopra in the lead role, with Naseeruddin Shah, Irrfan Khan, Annu Kapoor, Neil Nitin Mukesh, John Abraham, Aleksandr Dyachenko, Vivaan Shah and Usha Uthup in supporting roles. The film tells the story of a femme fatale, Susanna Anna-Marie Johannes, an Anglo-Indian woman who murders her seven husbands in an unending quest for love. 7 Khoon Maaf is an adaptation of the short story Susanna's Seven Husbands by Ruskin Bond. After Bhardwaj saw the possibility of a script in the short story, he requested Bond to develop the story for a film adaptation. Bond expanded his four-page short story into an 80-page novella, and later Bhardwaj co-wrote the script with Matthew Robbins. The film's musical score was composed by Bhardwaj, and Gulzar wrote the lyrics. Principal photography started in Kashmir before moving to Coorg, where extensive filming was done. The film opened on 18 February 2011 to mostly positive reviews, with praise for Chopra's performance. Despite the critical acclaim, 7 Khoon Maaf underperformed at the box-office. However, according to its producers, it made a profit by earning a total of \u20b933 crore (US$5.1\u00a0million) for its box-office run and television-music-home-video rights against a production budget of \u20b915 crore (US$2.3\u00a0million). It premiered at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival, receiving several accolades at award ceremonies across India. At the 57th Filmfare Awards 7 Khoon Maaf received three nominations, winning two: the Best Actress Critics Award for Chopra and the Best Female Playback Singer for Uthup and Rekha Bhardwaj's song, \"Darling\".   7 Khoon Maaf tells the story of an Anglo-Indian woman, Susanna Anna-Marie Johannes (Priyanka Chopra), who murders all her husbands. Susanna tries to find love, but six of her seven husbands have a flaw which proves fatal. The killings (and her yearning for love) are explained by the loss of her mother at a young age. The story is told by a young forensic pathologist, Arun (Vivaan Shah), to his wife, Nandini (Konkona Sen Sharma). Arun has watched Susanna since their childhood, and has a secret crush on her. He owes his life to her; she funded his education, making him what he is today. Arun tells his wife that Susanna has committed suicide, leaving him a note congratulating him on his marriage. The doctor must now confirm that the body found is Susanna's. Arun is unable to overcome his grief over her death and pours out his heart to his wife, who listens patiently. Susanna's (Priyanka Chopra) first husband\u2014Edwin Rodriques (Neil Nitin Mukesh), an army major\u2014is overbearing, jealous and possessive. Disabled, he cannot believe that a beautiful woman like Susanna would be faithful to him. Uncertain of his sexual potency, he takes out his anger on his wife. Although Susanna endures his mental cruelty, she cannot forgive Edwin for blinding her faithful, mute stableboy (Shashi Malviya) with a whip. Edwin is eliminated during a panther-hunting trip with the help of Susanna's faithful maid (Usha Uthup), butler (Harish Khanna) and the mute stableboy. Susanna's second husband\u2014Jamshed Singh Rathod (John Abraham), who renames himself Jimmy Stetson after their marriage\u2014is a singer whose flaw is pride. The marriage begins well, but Jimmy becomes successful and misuses his new-found fame. He steals songs, dallies with other women and becomes dependent on drugs. Susanna wants to be lucky in love the second time; she tries to wean him from his addiction, but he continues in secret. She gives up, disposing of him with a heroin overdose. Police investigators find footprints near his body indicating that a person with six toes is the murderer. Susanna's third husband\u2014Wasiullah Khan (also known as Musafir) (Irrfan Khan)\u2014is a soft-spoken, thoughtful poet by day and a sado-masochist by night. Susanna tries to cover her bruises with makeup; her servants cannot bear to see her mistreated, and advise her to get rid of him. Khan is ultimately interred in a snowy Kashmiri grave. Her fourth husband, Nicolai Vronsky (Aleksandr Dyachenko), is a Russian spy leading a double life. When Susanna discovers he has another wife and family, her rage knows no bounds and he meets his end with the aid of Susanna's pet snakes. After Vronsky's death, Susanna no longer agonizes over eliminating anyone of whom she disapproves. Her fifth husband, Keemat Lal (Annu Kapoor), is a police inspector who has shielded his \"Madame\" from prosecution for two murders in exchange for marriage. With a voracious appetite for sex, his dependence on Viagra proves his undoing; one fateful night, Susanna mixes an overdose of the drug into Lal's drink. Modhusudhon Tarafdar (Naseeruddin Shah) is a Bengali doctor who rescues Susanna from a suicide attempt (when she learns about Arun's marriage) and puts her on a mushroom-only diet. Although she does not want to marry him, Tarafdar persuades her with a promise that she will be the sole heir of his property. Actually bankrupt, he tries to poison Susanna with mushroom soup several years later for her inheritance. Her butler drinks it by accident and dies instead; in a state of shock, she shoots Tarafdar during a game of Russian roulette. That night, Susanna sets her house ablaze in another suicide attempt. Seeing the house on fire, her maid (who has six toes) tries to rescue her but dies in the attempt. In the forensics laboratory, Arun discovers that the body is not Susanna's; however, he declares Susanna dead in his reports. He looks for her; when he finds Susanna, she tells him she is finally getting married the next day to someone who accepts her, knowing all her sins. In an epiphany she imagines Jesus Christ as her seventh husband, full of love and never hurtful; she becomes a nun and finding the love she sought all her life. Arun and Nandini return home after he tells her that Susanna is dead. The idea for 7 Khoon Maaf came when Ruskin Bond sent his book of Short Story collection to Vishal Bhardwaj. He was intrigued by a four-page story's title named \"Susanna's Seven Husbands\", and thought it had potential for a novel and a film. Bhardwaj said, \"I told myself why would a woman have seven husbands and then I came to know that she also kills them! I was immediately hooked to it. It reminded me of a very old film, Bluebeard's Seven Wives\". Bhardwaj suggested the story to a fellow director, who was looking for a good story. However, after reading the short story, the director dismissed it saying it has no film potential. After reading the story twice, he became even more confident about possibility of a film. Bhardwaj who had previously adapted Bond's novel The Blue Umbrella into a film, decided to adapt the short story for the screen. Bhardwaj later requested Bond to turn the story into a novella, noting that only Bond could flesh out the characters well, to which he agreed. Bond expanded the story into an 80-page novella, which later became a 200-page full-length Hindi script. Bhardwaj co-wrote the script with Matthew Robbins. Bhardwaj noted that he retained Bond's theme, but incorporated his own elements to make the film a dark comedy. He said, \"I had previously taken liberties with Shakespeare. Naturally, when you adapt a story, your vision also comes in it. But I have remained honest to its essence\". He included Keemat Lal (who plays a police officer in all Bond's stories), although the character is not in the original story. Bhardwaj decided to include him in the film as an homage to Bond, explaining that he took liberties with characters' names and traits. Bond also had to devise Indian methods of killing the husbands, which he found challenging: \"The challenge was devising seven ingenious ways in which she could kill her husbands without being suspected. And she does it successfully, until towards the end\". Priyanka Chopra was Bhardwaj's original choice for the role of Susanna after he worked with the actress in Kaminey: He said that Chopra \"is the finest actor of her generation right now... As a director I had so much trust on her that I felt that no one else can essay this role as brilliantly as she would do\". Mohanlal was cast as one of Susanna's husbands in the film; however, he left the project to concentrate on Malayalam films. The actor was replaced by Annu Kapoor in the role of Inspector Keemat Lal. Other actors in the film were John Abraham, Naseeruddin Shah, Neil Nitin Mukesh and Vivaan Shah. Directors Karan Johar and Imtiaz Ali were approached to play two of the seven husbands, but they reportedly turned down the offer. Usha Uthup was cast as Susanna's maid in the film. Konkona Sen Sharma was confirmed for a cameo appearance. During production, the film underwent two name changes. The project was initially titled Seven, which became Ek Bataa Saat and finally 7 Khoon Maaf. In the film, Chopra's character ages from 20 to 65, and prosthetic makeup was used for her looks at different ages. Bhardwaj hired Hollywood special makeup effects artist Greg Cannom, who did the makeup for 2008's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, to create seven looks for the character. Chopra found the most challenging period was that of the 65-year-old woman. The actress said, \"prosthetics had to play a heavy part but I\u2019m happy that I pushed myself as the result is really fab. I had to be very careful of not doing things that would damage the make-up\". To make Chopra look authentic, the makeup team used Chopra's mother's and grandmother\u2019s photos to create her look. She had to gain five kg weight to fit her aging character. Principal photography began in March 2010 with Chopra and Irrfan Khan in Kashmir. Locations included Shalimar Bagh and Dal Lake in Srinagar. The cast and crew were provided with two-tier security coverage by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Jammu & Kashmir Police, due to unrest in the valley. The film was also shot in Gulmarg, Delhi and Coorg, which included extensive shooting in the forests. Other locations were Puducherry, Mumbai, Hyderabad and in Russia. During filming Chopra was restricted from eating and drinking while donning the prosthetic makeup (which took five hours to apply). The film's score and songs were composed by Vishal Bhardwaj, with lyrics by Gulzar. Its soundtrack contains seven songs and two reprise versions. The soundtrack was digitally released on Ovi (Nokia) on 21 January 2011, and on CD 24 January 2011. The song \"Darling\" is based on the Russian folk song \"Kalinka\", and contains several Russian words (one of Susanna's husbands was Russian). \"Kalinka\" is credited on the album cover. \"Tere Liye\", sung by Suresh Wadkar, was not used in the film. The soundtrack received positive reviews from music critics. The Indo-Asian News Service gave the album 3.5 stars (out of 5): \"Bharadwaj has composed a wonderful album that is not a clone of his previous work. It exudes freshness and is worth listening. However, the songs would not have achieved zenith without Gulzar's lovely lyrics. The team has done it again\". Bollywood Hungama rated the album a 3 (out of 5): \"7 Khoon Maaf is a good album with a couple of definite hits, couple of skip worthy ones and the remaining have the potential to grow. Since 7 Khoon Maaf is not a routine Bollywood affair, it can't be expecting a quick pick at the stands from Day One\". The Hindustan Times noted that the soundtrack takes the listener through a variety of moods: \"Bhardwaj has certainly succeeded in adding new sounds to his catalogue. He continues to evade Bollywood monotony with this soundtrack [...] an innovative effort.\" The film's preview and trailer were released on 24 December 2010 to a positive response from critics, who praised the whole presentation and Chopra's dialogues particularly: \"duniya ki har biwi ne kabhie na kabhie toh yeh zarur sochega, ki main apne pati se hamesha hamesha ke liye chutkara kaise paun\" (\"Every wife in the entire world must have once in her lifetime thought of how to get rid of her husband forever\"). Following the preview-trailer launches, Chopra promoted the film by appearing with seven men (dressed as bridegrooms) at the Radio Mirchi FM studio. The succession of marriages and funerals was illustrated at a promotional event for the film, where Chopra appeared as a Catholic bride in a wedding gown holding a bouquet. A short time later she reappeared as a widow in mourning, for her husbands' funerals. Emphasizing the film's theme, Chopra introduced a \"seven ways to lose your Valentine\" press kit for reporters at a Valentines Day promotion. The kit contained a rope, a syringe, a knife, a bottle of poison, a sachet of potassium cyanide, an ice pick and a blister pack of Viagra, which was based on Susanna's way to kill her husbands in the film. In February 2011, a book entitled Susanna's Seven Husbands was released by Penguin Books as a collector's edition including the novella, the short story and the film\u2019s screenplay. The film was screened at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival as part of its world premiere in the festival's Panorama section. At the Friedrichstadt Palace (a Berlin theatre) an audience of some 2,500 people watched the film on the festival's final evening, giving the director and the nine cast and crew members present a standing ovation when they appeared onstage. 7 Khoon Maaf was originally scheduled for release on 21 January 2011, but was postponed a month to avoid conflicting with Dhobi Ghat. The film was released on 18 February 2011 on about 700 screens across India. Reliance Home Entertainment released 7 Khoon Maaf on DVD in March 2011 across all regions in a one-disc NTSC format. The Blu-ray and Video CD versions were released at the same time. 7 Khoon Maaf was critically praised and Chopra's performance was singled out in particular, with many reviewers describing it as \"a role of a lifetime\". Aniruddha Guha of the Daily News and Analysis rated the film a four (out of five) and wrote, \"For a filmmaker who has long established his hold over the craft, 7 Khoon Maaf is the only way forward \u2013 it pushes the envelope and takes you on a cinematic journey you may not experience in a Hindi film for a long time to come\". She praised Chopra's performance: \"Priyanka Chopra takes on a character that most of her contemporaries would shy away from and enacts it in a way that only she possibly can. For a woman with as many shades as Susanna, Chopra gets a crack at a role of a lifetime. And Bhardwaj ensures she sparkles like never before\". The Indo-Asian News Service described the film as a \"winner\" by Vishal Bhardwaj, rating it four out of five: \"Chalk up an absolute winner for the Vishal Bhardwaj-Priyanka Chopra team. They make a coherent vision out of an inconceivable marital crises.\" Zee News also rated the film four out of five: \"Vishal Bhardwaj does it again. The maverick filmmaker has once again woven magic with his latest blockbuster Saat Khoon Maaf, which presents Priyanka Chopra in a never before character\". Nikhat Kazmi of the Times of India gave the film a 3.5 (out of 5) rating, describing it as \"serious, sensitive and stirring\", \"a whole new cinematic experience\" and praising Chopra's performance: \"7 Khoon Maaf would undoubtedly end up as a milestone in Priyanka Chopra's career graph. The actor displays exquisite command over a complex character that is definitely a first in Indian cinema. She renders a subtle and restrained portrayal of a lonely and wronged woman who wanted love and only love from life\". Mayank Shekhar of the Hindustan Times gave 7 Khoon Maaf three out of five stars noting that the film was crafted around strong, effective scenes alone: a lot of them, cleanly cut and clinical, a whole lot immediately compelling, and recommended not to miss the partly captivating film Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film three stars, saying that \"7 Khoon Maaf is a dark film that has its share of positives and negatives. However, the film will meet with diverse reactions \u2013 some will fancy it, while some will abhor it. The film will appeal more to the critics/columnists and the festival circuit\". The film also received some criticism. The Telegraph's Pratim D. Gupta called 7 Khoon Maaf \"adventurous but over-indulgent\", saying that Vishal Bhardwaj \"traded economy for mainstream acceptance\". However, Gupta praised the film's cinematography and its unexpected ending: \"Discovering Susanna\u2019s seventh husband [is] a killer twist in the end\". Anupama Chopra of NDTV gave the movie two-and-a-half stars (out of five), terming it a \"disappointment\" and saying \"the film stumbles and fumbles. The episodic nature of the narrative makes the plot predictable.\" At the box office, the film opened to weak ticket sales across India (its release coincided with the 2011 Cricket World Cup). It grossed \u20b914 crore (US$2.2\u00a0million) during its first week. By the end of its domestic box office run, the film earned approximately \u20b920 crore (US$3.1\u00a0million), an underperformance compared to its production budget of \u20b915 crore (US$2.3\u00a0million). It made an additional \u20b913 crore (US$2.0\u00a0million) from the pre-release sale of music, television, and home video rights. Its producers reported that the venture was commercially successful. Siddharth Roy Kapur (CEO of UTV Motion Pictures) said, \"'7 Khoon Maaf' has worked well for us commercially due to a combination of tight production budgeting, optimised spending on prints and publicity and a pre-sales strategy that helped us to de-risk the film via sales of home video, music, satellite and theatrical rights even before the release\". 7 Khoon Maaf received a number of nominations and won several awards, particularly Best Actress for Chopra. The film received three nominations at the 57th Filmfare Awards, winning two: Best Actress (Critics) for Chopra and Best Female playback singer for Utthup and Bhardwaj for \"Darling\". At the Screen Awards the film received five nominations; Chopra won the Best Actor in a Negative Role award. 7 Khoon Maaf won three Producers Guild Film Awards (out of six nominations) in technical categories: Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.",

        "full_text": " Aah is a 1953 black and white Bollywood romantic drama film starring Raj Kapoor and Nargis in lead roles. The film was produced by Raj Kapoor and directed by Raja Nawathe. This was Nawathe's first independent directorial venture. He had previously worked as assistant director to Kapoor in Aag (1948), Barsaat (1949) and Awaara (1951). The film was rated \"Below Average\" at the box office but has various hit songs like \"Raja Ki Aayegi Baaraat\", \"Aaja Re Ab Mera Dil Pukara\" and \"Jaane Na Nazar\". The song \"Chhoti Si Yeh Zindagani\" sung by Mukesh was also picturised on him. Subsequently, the film was later dubbed in Tamil as Avan and Telugu as Prema Lekhalu .   Raj Raibahadur (Raj Kapoor) lives a wealthy lifestyle with his father, a widowed businessman. One day Raj is sent to work at the countryside Saraswati Dam. His father one day visits him and tells him how his deceased mother wished that he be married to Chandra (played by Vijayalaxmi), the daughter of his rich family friend. Raj decides to write a letter to Chandra which she completely ignores. But Chandra's younger sister Neelu (Nargis) acknowledges the letter and responds to it in Chandra's name. After few letters Raj and Neelu fall in love, but Raj is still unaware that it is Neelu who writes to him. Just then Raj is diagnosed with tuberculosis, the same disease that killed his mother. Raj decides to pretend that he never loved Neelu and also insists that she should marry his physician friend, Dr. Kailash (Pran). He also flirts with Chandra to make Neelu believe that he does not love her. Chandra decides to end the suffering of her sister, who is sobbing for her love-loss. Upon learning the truth, Neelu accepts Raj as he is. Miraculously, Raj also turns well and both lead for a happy life. The theme of the tragic hero and the sufferings of the heroine was inspired from Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's famous novel Devdas, which has also been inspiration to various other films. The end of the film originally showed Neelu marrying Dr. Kailash at Raj's insistence; Raj dies while Neelu's wedding procession is passing by. But at the premiere, Kapoor realised that this film would not work. Kapoor said, The atmosphere in an auditorium is like a living, palpitating thing. It told me again and again: \"Your picture is a flop.\" The end of the film was then changed from a tragic one to the happy one, but the change destroyed the thematic unity of the text. Bunny Reuben, who wrote Kapoor's biography Raj Kapoor, The Fabulous Showman, gives his rationale for the change: \"The film had some of Shankar-Jaikishan's loveliest music, and a 'Devdas'-ian tragic ending which was changed to the conventional happy ending because the film didn't do well in its first release.\" Composed by the musical duo Shankar Jaikishan. Hindi songs for the film are written by Shailendra and Hasrat Jaipuri. Tamil songs for the film are written by Kambadasan. Telugu songs for the film are written by Aarudhra. Amongst them Panditlo Pellauthunnadi song is an evergreen track played at many marriage functions even today.",

It was released in India and in the United States on 30 November 2007. The film stars Madhuri Dixit in her first film after five years, alongside Konkona Sen Sharma, Jugal Hansraj, Akshaye Khanna and Kunal Kapoor in pivotal roles. The film opened to mixed reviews and was declared a Flop by Box Office India.   Dia (Madhuri Dixit) is a choreographer who lives in New York with her daughter Radha. One day she receives word that her old dance teacher, Makarand, is dying. She returns to her hometown Shamli with Radha, to find that he has already died and left her the responsibility of saving the deserted dance theatre, Ajanta, which is to be demolished to make way for a shopping mall. Shamli has changed a great deal since Dia left. Her parents left the town in shame a decade ago, after she eloped with an American photographer, and their house is now owned by the strict Mr Chojar and his wife. Her childhood friend Najma is married to Farooque, a successful businessman. Both of them greet Dia coldly. The only ally she has left is her old friend Doctor Saab. To save Ajanta, Dia goes to petition the local MP Raja Uday Singh. He issues her a challenge; if she can put on a successful performance using only people from Shamli, he will cancel the demolition. That night Dia dances in Ajanta and afterwards calls on the people to help her put on a performance of the famous Laila-Majnu play. Jeering at her, they leave the theatre one by one, but Raja remains behind, reminding her of the challenge. Refusing to accept defeat, Dia goes out into the street the next day to scout for talent. When she returns to the theatre she finds that a group of thugs are burning the set, after being ordered by a local election candidate, Chaudhary Om Singh. Instead of being angry, she is intrigued by the ring-leader, Imran, and makes a deal with Chaudhary - she will help him win the next election, if he will support Ajanta and if Imran plays Majnu. He agrees and Imran is forced to take on the role. After finding out about the casting of Imran, many girls flock to the theatre for the part of Laila. Among them is Anokhi, a tomboy who is in love with Imran. She begs Dia, who is reluctant because of her rough appearance and lack of talent, but agrees in the end, thinking that her love for Imran will make her the ideal Laila. Other parts in the play go to Mr Chojar, who wants to prove to his wife that he is not boring, Chaudhary who plays Laila\u2019s father and Dia\u2019s former fianc\u00e9 Mohan, who is able to overcome his bitterness towards her. With one month to put the show together, Dia struggles to get Imran and Anokhi to work together. With Dia\u2019s support, Anokhi changes her attitude and appearance to get Imran to take her seriously and soon their relationship deepens. A few days before the show, Farooque pays Chaudhary to abandon Ajanta and makes Najma spread hurtful stories about Dia. Chaudhary tries to get Imran to give up his part, but Imran is aware of Chaudhary\u2019s political intentions and refuses, leading him to be attacked by Chaudhary\u2019s men while Anokhi tries to protect him. With the whole town against her, Dia loses hope until Najma arrives to apologise and asks to be in the show. On the night of the show, Dia is amazed to find that the entire town has come to Ajanta. The troupe put on a performance that amazes and excites the audience, including Chaudhary who is moved to tears. Farooque is stunned to see his wife playing the part of Laila\u2019s mother and Mrs Chojar is shocked and thrilled when her husband appears singing and dancing on stage. At the end, the audience cheers loudly as the cast return to the stage for an encore. The night is a success and Ajanta is saved. After Dia says her farewells to Shamli, she and Radha leave to find her parents in another part of India. Imran and Anokhi go on to teach dance classes at Ajanta with Doctor Saab\u2019s help and dance becomes an inherent part of Shamli once again. Raja is seen watching Dia dance and it is implied that they develop a romance. Shooting began on 15 January 2007 at Film City in Mumbai and ended in March 2007. Madhuri Dixit told that during the shoot of Aaja Nachle, she was given special attention by the crew. Madhuri\u2019s favourite chocolates were brought everyday on the shoot. The film's soundtrack was released on 18 October 2007 composed by Salim-Sulaiman and lyrics by Jaideep Sahni and Piyush Mishra. A few songs from the final sequence of the movie have not been included on the soundtrack including \"Yeh Ishq\". The film's music was well received. This soundtrack debuted at number 9 for the first week. The song \"O Re Piya\" was later used in the 2009 Malaysian movie Talentime. and other dance classmates with Steve taking pictures Aaja Nachle opened to a poor response due to controversy. The domestic performance of the film was below average mostly everywhere. Overseas the response was lukewarm as well. Movie managed to collect Rs 207.5\u00a0million and was declared a flop by Box Office India. The film was received with mixed reception from both critics and audiences. The lead performances received mixed reviews. Khalid Mohammed from the Hindustan Times wrote, \"Madhuri Dixit has a cool time. Konkona is overacting while Kunal Kapoor is flustered\", while Rajeev Masand from CNN-IBN noted, \"Madhuri is the one and only star of the film. Konkona Sen Sharma is nothing short of fantastic. Her greatest strength is that she isn't afraid of making a fool of herself and she doesn't worry about being laughed at. As a result, her performance in Aaja Nachle is fearless and uninhibited.\" Madhuri was nominated for the best actress award at the 54th Filmfare awards in 2008. The movie was banned in Uttar Pradesh, Harayana, Punjab on the 1st three days of its release over alleged casteist remarks. It majorly affected the its Box office Rating Dia, the character played by Madhuri Dixit, sings the lines Mohalle mein kaisi maara-mar hai; bole mochi bhi khud ko sunar hai (translated \"There is chaos in the neighborhood, even the Mochi (Cobbler) calls himself a Sunar (Goldsmith)\". Dalit groups said the line implied that Mochis (the Jatav caste \u2013 a caste of cobblers) were inferior to Sunars (goldsmiths). Punjab and Haryana followed suit, banning the film the next day. However the ban was later lifted in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana, after a written apology from the producers and the removal of the disputed lyrics (bole mochi bhi khud ko sunar hai) in the title song. The lyrics were replaced by other words mere dar pe deewano ki bahaar hai(translated \"there is a parade of lovers at my doorstep\"). However, a ban was imposed in the city of Patna on 2 December 2007. The issue was also raised in the Indian Parliament (Lok Sabha) by RPI member Ramdas Athawale who sought a ban by the government for hurting Dalit sentiments, but Information and Broadcasting Minister Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi said that it was the responsibility of state governments to take any such action.",

Bokadia and starring Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Prada. The film premiered on 10 August 1990 in Mumbai and was filmed in Rajasthan. The film became a box office hit. It is a remake of 1988 Tamil film En Thangachi Padichava starring Prabhu Ganesan and Rupini.   Thakur Bhupendra Singh (Amrish Puri) and his son Ajit (Rishabh Shukla) are landlords, presiding oppressively over a small Indian community. Ajit gets Laxmi (Raadhika) pregnant and casts her aside. Her brother Bheema (Amitabh Bachchan) goes to plead with them to accept Laxmi as their daughter-in-law and they reject his pleas and have him thrown out. Bheema tries to avenge this humiliation, only to have his sister killed. Bheema is imprisoned, and after his sentence is over he returns to his community, only to be told that he can no longer reside there, as the entire community is terrified of the Thakur and his men. Bheema then decides to move out of town. Some villagers and a police officer (Anupam Kher) persuade Bheema to return, and he agrees. On his return, Bheema's nephew Kanhaiya (Baby Guddu) is abducted by Thakur and his men, and he will only be returned after Bheema obtains signatures/thumb prints from everyone in the community, thereby turning over their properties to Thakur's name. Will Bheema compromise the safety of his nephew, and will he able to persuade the community to bow down to Thakur's demands? Music for the film was composed by Bappi Lahiri, one of the leading music directors of the time. The film has a memorable number \"Gori Hai Kalaiyaan, Tu Laade Mujhe Hari Hari Choodiyaan\" with voices lent by Shabbir Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar, which earned great popularity that year. During those days, when cable television and Dish TV facilities were not as popular in India as they are today, this song was often telecast in some programmes of Doordarshan as a trendy track of that period. Picturised on Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Prada, the song charmed the listeners, and today it is considered as one of the evergreen songs of the 90s. ",

        "full_text": " Aakrosh (English: Cry of the Wounded) is a 1980 Hindi arthouse film directed by auteur Govind Nihalani and written by renowned Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar.  \nThe film starred Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri and Amrish Puri in lead roles and went to win 1980 National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi and several Filmfare Awards. It won the 'Golden Peacock' for the Best Film at the International Film Festival of India. This was the debut film of Nihalani, who went on to be known for his dark and frighteningly real depictions of human angst in other landmark alternative movies such as Ardh Satya and Tamas. It is in the list of 60 films that shaped the Indian film industry spanning six decades.   Allegedly based on a true incident reported on page 7 of a local newspaper, the film was a scathing satire on the corruption in the judicial system and the victimization of the underprivileged by the able and the powerful. Aakrosh forms a part of the series of works, based around explorations in violence, written by noted playwright Vijay Tendulkar, who had earlier written Shyam Benegal's Nishant (1974) and went to write Govind Nihalani's next surprise breakaway hit, Ardh Satya (1983). Here the victim is shown so traumatized by excessive oppression and violation of his humanity, that he does not utter a single word almost for the length of the film and only bears a stunned look, though later he uses the same violence as a tool to express his own sense of violation and rage. Basically, the story is of a peasant who is oppressed by landowners and his foremen while trying to eke out a living as a daily laborer. His comely wife, played by Smita Patil, is raped by the foreman who then has him arrested to hide his own crime. His wife commits suicide out of shame. The police bring him to the funeral grounds in manacles and shackles to complete the Last Rites of his dead father by lighting the funeral pyre \u2014 which in the Hindu religion only the son has the right to. Standing beside the burning funeral pyre, he sees the foreman looking at his pre-pubescent sister with lustful eyes. Divining the fate that is in store for her, he grabs an axe and chops off his sister's head to forestall her dire future as perpetual victim, as he sees it. Upon completion of this hapless act of a desperate and downtrodden man, he raises his face towards the skies and screams, and screams and screams \u2014 the second time that we hear his voice in the movie (the first is in a flashback, as he vainly attempts to rescue his wife) \u2014 a device similar to Andrei Tarkovsky's showing of the icons in brilliant color at the end of his three-hour black-and-white film Andrei Rublev. The aggressive act of Lahanya Biku {literal trans.: beggar of the Lahanya caste} mirrors the climax of Telugu short story \"Yagnam\" by Kalipatnam Ramarao.[citation needed] Appalanaidu, a character in Yagnam, cuts the throat of his child with an axe after the verdict delivered by village heads comes against him. In view of the future sorrow of his heirs, now that he will not be there to protect them or provide for them, Appalanaidu commits this act.[citation needed] In Aakrosh, the story line is very similar, as a similar murderous act is carried out by Biku - as he envisions the traumatic future of his sister.",

        "full_text": " Aandhi (Hindi: \u0906\u0902\u0927\u0940, translation: Storm) is a 1975 Indian political drama film starring Sanjeev Kumar and Suchitra Sen, and directed by Gulzar. At the time it was alleged that the film was based on the life of the then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her relationship with her estranged husband, but in reality, only the look was inspired by the politician Tarkeshwari Sinha and Indira Gandhi. The story is based on a chance meeting of an estranged couple after several years, when wife Aarti Devi, now a leading politician happens to stay in the hotel run by her husband during an election campaign. The movie is noted for its songs composed by Rahul Dev Burman, written by Gulzar and sung by Kishore Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar. Suchitra Sen, the noted actress from Bengali cinema, who also worked in a few Hindi films, played the lead role of Aarti Devi after actress Vyjayanthimala refused the film as she had reservations about enacting the role. The movie was not allowed a full release when Mrs. Gandhi was in power. The film was banned during the national emergency of 1975 a few months after its release. The ban immediately made the film a national topic. After her defeat in the 1977 national elections, the ruling Janata Party cleared it and had it premiered on the state-run television channel. It proved to be an important film in the career of Sen, and also her last Hindi film, as she retired from films altogether in 1978. At the 23rd Filmfare Awards, she was nominated for Filmfare Best Actress Award, while Sanjeev Kumar won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. The film itself won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie.   J.K. (played by Sanjeev Kumar) is a Hotel manager. One day he gallantly comes to the rescue of a politician's drunk daughter, Aarti (Suchitra Sen). Aarti falls in love with J.K. and both get married in a small ceremony. After few years, the married couple face many differences due to which they decide to separate. Years later, J.K. and Aarti meet again when she is an established politician. Despite the separation, both of them feel the closeness but fearing that her name might be tarnished and jeopardise her career, Aarti does not want to step forward. Gulzar said the film had no semblance with the personal life of then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi. He wanted to make film about modern Indian politician, and so he modelled the character on Indira Gandhi and to some extent on noted parliamentarian from Bihar, Tarkeshwari Sinha. An early version of the film's story was written by veteran screenwriter Sachin Bhowmick, however it did not go well with Gulzar. He had an idea of an estranged couple meeting in an hotel after years, and started developing it. Hindi writer Kamleshwar joined as the writing crew, as the film started shooting. He later went on to write a full-fledged novel, Kali Aandhi (Black Storm), which is quite different from the film. Subsequently, the film was written simultaneously along with another Gulzar film, Mausam (1975), which was also written by Bhushan Banmali and Gulzar. Along with Khushboo, Aandhi also released in the same year; 1975 proving to be the most prolific for director-screenwriter Gulzar's career. The lead role of Aarti Devi was offered to actress Vyjayanthimala, who refused as she was fazed by physical resemblance of her character with Indira Gandhi. Later in 2011, she recounted Aandhi as one of few films she regretted not doing besides Mr and Mrs 55 (1955) by Guru Dutt and Bandini (1963) by Bimal Roy, \"I admired Indiraji (Gandhi) so much so that I got cold feet when the role was offered to me.\" In the early 1960s, director Gulzar had approached Suchitra Sen, with screenplay for a film to be produced by Sohanlal Kanwar, however when she suggested some changes which Gulzar didn't agree upon, the film never got made. For film Aandhi producer J. Om Prakash insisted upon Gulzar to approach Sen again and actors Sanjeev Kumar was also keen on working with Sen. This time when the new script was done, Gulzar went to meet her in Kolkata, she agreed without any script issues, resulting in a casting coup. In fact, Sen now promised Gulzar to not suggest any changes, and she stuck to her promise all through the filming. For the role Aarti Devi's estranged husband Sanjeev Kumar was already cast, who had previously worked in Gulzar's Koshish (1973), again as an older man. Kumar one of finest actors of his generation went to collaborated with Gulzar on numerous films, like Mausam (1975), Angoor (1981) and Namkeen (1982). Like most of Gulzar's films, including Mausam and Ijaazat, the narrative of Aandhi also unfolds through various flashbacks.  The film was almost shot together with Mausam, with Sanjeev Kumar playing the lead of an old man in both the films. Though Aandhi was released first, it ran into political controversy and portions of it has to be reshot, meanwhile Mausam was completed and released. The songs of the film were shot at various locations in Jammu and Kashmir state, like \"Tum Aa Gaye Ho\" was shot around Pari Mahal gardens in Srinagar, the classic \"Tere Bina Zindagi Se\" at the ruined 7th-8th century Martand Sun Temple, near Anantnag, while \"Is Mod Se Jaate Hai\" was shot at Pahalgam. Most of the songs have architectural ruins as a backdrop, depicting brokeness. Gulzar's family, wife actress Raakhee and daughter young Meghna Gulzar accompanied him on the shooting in Kashmir, however upon the return Rakhee and Gulzar separated. In her memoir, daughter Meghna mentioned that Gulzar's wife Rakhee had once said to him, \"Agar aap shayar na hote, to bade hi ordinary hote\" (If you weren't a poet, you would have been very ordinary), this line was paraphrased and spoken by Aarti Devi to her husband in the film.  The film looks at the life of a career-minded woman in the political arena, which is large dominated by men. Aarti inherits the legacy of her ambitious politician father, and comes in conflict with her role as dutiful wife. Soon she need needs to make choices to resolve the conflicts, and part ways with her husband, giving career rather duty as a daughter precedence over her personal life. When they meet again after nine years of separation, the dominating personality created under influence of her father has mellow and wisdom risen and she sees what she has missed. Yet she finds herself at a choice point once again, should she give up her political career or settle for matrimonial life. Aandhi takes on a feminist theme, also taken up in Ray's Mahanagar before, as it questions the price women often have to pay for political aspirations or career aspiration for that matter, when her unambitious hotel manager husband refuses to support. It also satirizes the political opportunism in Indian democracy, where politicians visit the common man only every five years, at the time of elections. Through the lines of the song \"Salaam kijiye aali janaab aaye hain, ye paanch saalon ka dene hisaab aaye hain. (Bow to the masters.. They have come after five years...). At the 23rd Filmfare Awards held in 1976, the film was nominated in various categories. The music of this film was composed by Rahul Dev Burman with lyrics by Gulzar. Director-lyricist Gulzar first worked with Burman or Pancham as he commonly known as in Parichay (1972), giving popular songs like \"Beeti Na Bitai Raina and \"Musafir Hoon Yaaro\". In the following years their team gradually developed in the preceding years, eventually reaching a flourish in 1975 with two important film scores in the same year, Aandhi and Khushboo. Previously Gulzar had like the use of pure notes (shuddha swara) in \"Raina Beete Jai\" from Amar Prem (1972) by Burman, a treatment which was used in the film's title music. The Lata Mangeshkar-Kishore Kumar duet \"Is Mod Se Jaate Hain\" extended the major scale usage with an added sharp (Teevra Madhyam) and reminiscence of Raga Yaman. Even the interludes included Indian classical instruments, like flute played by Hariprasad Chaurasia, sarod by Zarin Daruwala (Sharma) and sitar by Jairam Acharya, aided by a violin ensemble. The tune of \"Tere Bina..\" another Lata Mangeshkar-Kishore Kumar duet, was originally created as Durga Puja song, \"Jete Jete Potho Holo Tere\" in Bengali, which Gulzar liked and wrote lyrics around the tune  The RD-Gulzar team created for the film, songs which were both acclaimed and also popular songs of the decade. Songs like \"Tere Bina Zindagi\", \"Tum Aa Gaye Ho\" and \"Is Mod Se Jate Hain\" are considered eternal classics in Indian cinema. Songs \"Tere Bina Zindagi Se\" and \"Is Mod Se Jate Hain\" were listed 5th and 14th respectively on Binaca Geetmala annual list 1975. As per Planet Bollywood listings, \"Tere Bina Zindagi Se\" stands number 2 amongst top 10 Bollywood songs of the 1970s. The film released in February 1975 amidst controversy, as rumours abound that it was based on the life of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Some of film's posters also hyped the similarity, with lines like, \"See your Prime Minister on screen\" and \"the story of a great woman political leader in post-Independence India\", were featured in a film magazine. Eventually, the film was given a go ahead after it was seen by two staff members and then Information and Broadcasting minister, I.K. Gujral. After the released, similarity was seen the dressing and mannerism of lead Aarti Devi, played by Suchitra Sen and Mrs Gandhi, including the sarees and streak of white hair. During the June Legislative assembly election campaign in Gujarat, some opposition politicians were shown scenes of the film, depicting Aarti Devi smoking and drinking. As the film gained momentum, some ambitious exhibitors even started promoting the film with the line, \"See Indira Gandhi in Aandhi\", by now film was openly courting controversy, despite being only a mild satire on politicians. The film was eventually banned after 26 weeks after it release. In June State of Emergency was declared in India by Mrs. Gandhi, and on 12 July despite heavy press censorship, The Statesman managed to carry the headline on its front page, \"Screening on Aandhi banned\". Gulzar who had then taken the film to Moscow International Film Festival got the news of the ban prior to the screening. He was also informed that the film publicity posters be taken down and the prints sent back. Subsequently, while Mausam was being premeiered in December 1975, portions of Aandhi were being reshot. It included the controversial drinking scene and to establish the fact it was not a biopic, a scene with Aarti Devi looking at the framed image of Indira Gandhi tells her father that she wants to serve India like Mrs Gandhi, \"Woh meri ideal thi\" (She is my ideal) was inserted. After Indira Gandhi lost the general election of 1977, and Janata Party came to power it was re-released and also shown on the state-run national television. The film went on to become biggest hit of the Sen's Bollywood career, of which Aandhi was the last film, though she did two more Bengali films before retiring from acting in 1978.  Some critics, including Subhash K. Jha have drawn thematic parallels between Indira Gandhi and her father Jawaharlal Nehru as depicted in the film also references to their personal lives. Also the role of Sanjeev Kumar, having shades of Mrs. Gandhi's husband. All through the controversy, Gulzar denied any connection with Indira Gandhi, it was only after she lost the national elections in 1977 and Janata Party came to power, did he admit, \"Yes, the film was made with Indira Gandhi in mind\". Sanjeev Kumar on his part said, only the characterisation of his role was based on Feroze Gandhi.",

Starring Aditya Roy Kapur and Shraddha Kapoor in the lead roles, it was produced by Bhushan Kumar and Mukesh Bhatt under the T-Series and Vishesh Films banners. Set in the early 2010s, Aashiqui 2 is a love story centering on the turbulent relationship between musicians Rahul and Arohi, a relationship which is affected by Rahul's issues with alcohol abuse and temperament. The film is a spiritual successor to the 1990 musical film Aashiqui, and initially caused concern in the Indian media that the film could live up to the high standards and success of the original. Production of Aashiqui 2 began in 2011, with the principal photography taking place in Cape Town, Goa and Mumbai on a budget of \u20b990 million (US$1.4\u00a0million). The film which premiered on 26 April 2013 received a positive to mixed critical reception and became a major commercial success at the box-office despite featuring newcomers, earning \u20b91.09 billion (US$17\u00a0million) worldwide within the first four weeks. It was declared as a blockbuster by Box Office India after its three-week box office run, and is the highest-grossing film ever produced by Vishesh Films. The soundtrack to the film became very popular after its release; the songs \"Tum Hi Ho\" and \"Sunn Raha Hai\" topped the charts across various platforms in India. It was later remade in Telugu as Nee Jathaga Nenundali   The film opens by showing a large crowd waiting for Rahul Jaykar (Aditya Roy Kapoor)\u00a0\u2013 a successful singer and musician whose career is waning because of his alcohol addiction\u00a0\u2013 to perform at a stage show in Goa. After nearly completing a song, he is unexpectedly interrupted by Aryan (Salil Acharya), who was losing his career due to Rahul's, during his performance. Rahul fights him, stops his performance, and drives to a local bar. He meets Aarohi Keshav Shirke (Shraddha Kapoor), a bar singer who idolises Rahul. After noticing Aarohi looking at a photograph of Lata Mangeshkar in the bar, he assumes that she wants to become a singer. Impressed by her simplicity and voice, Rahul promises to transform her into a singing sensation, and asks her to never perform again in bars. Due to his assurance, Aarohi leaves her job and returns to Mumbai with Rahul, who convinces record producer Saigal (Mahesh Thakur) to meet her. When Aarohi calls Rahul, he is attacked and injured by some thugs, and is unable to receive her call. His friend and manager Vivek (Shaad Randhawa) says that news of Rahul's accident should not be leaked to the media, and instead publicises a false story that Rahul has left the country to participate in stage shows. When Aarohi attempts to contact Rahul again, Vivek ignores the calls. After two months of futilely attempting to contact Rahul, a broken Aarohi is forced to sing in bars again because of her family problems. Meanwhile, Rahul recovers from his injuries and Rahul again starts the search for Aarohi. He learns that Aarohi is working in a bar again and that Vivek had ignored her calls without informing him. Rahul apologises to Aarohi and fires Vivek, and they meet with Saigal for the recording agreement. Rahul begins to train Aarohi, who signs a music contract to sing in films and becomes a successful playback singer. Her family and Rahul are happy, but when people begin to gossip that Rahul is using her as a servant, he relapses into alcohol addiction. Aarohi, who loves Rahul more than her career, comforts him and they have sex. Despite Aarohi's mother's disapproval, Aarohi moves in with Rahul and things go well until Rahul's addiction worsens, causing him to become aggressive and violent. To help Rahul fight his alcoholism, Aarohi attempts to rehabilitate Rahul, sacrificing her singing career in doing so. After Saigal reminds them about their dream of Aarohi becoming a successful singer, Rahul orders her to focus on her work. During Aarohi's stage show, Rahul meets a journalist backstage, who accuses him of using Aarohi for pleasure and money. Furious, Rahul beats up the journalist and starts drinking. He ends up in jail, and Aarohi comes to bail him out. Rahul overhears Aarohi telling Saigal that she is going to leave her career for him and is ready to give up her celebrity status because Rahul is more important to her. Rahul understands that he has become a burden in her life, and that leaving her is his only option to save her. The next day, he bids her farewell by assuring her that he will change his lifestyle . Distraught by Rahul's death, Aarohi decides to leave her career but Vivek persuades her to stay. He reminds her that Rahul wanted her to become a successful singer and killed himself as he did not want to be a burden on her and remain an obstacle in the path of her success. Aarohi agrees, and returns to singing. Later, she signs her name as \"Aarohi Rahul Jaykar\" in a fan's handbook as a tribute to Rahul and her unsung desire to marry him. As rain starts falling, she watches the couple who took her autograph sharing a romantic moment under a jacket as she and Rahul had done . In September 2011, the Indian media reported that Mahesh Bhatt and Bhushan Kumar were keen to remake the 1990 musical blockbuster Aashiqui. Kumar approached Bhatt for a possible sequel, although it was Shagufta Rafique's melodramatic romantic script which persuaded him that the film had potential as a sequel and decided to proceed with the project. Given Aashiqui 's status in Hindi cinematic history as one of the finest Indian musicals of all time, many expressed concerns towards the decision to remake the film, dubious that the producers could come up with a soundtrack on par with the quality of the 1990 film. Bhatt stated that they completely resisted the temptation to use the soundtrack of the earlier film, and promised that Aashiqui 2 would revive the era of melodious film music, as Aashiqui had done 22 years ago. It was reported that Madhur Bhandarkar had been approached to direct the film, but later turned down the offer because of other working commitments. It was confirmed in November 2011 that Vishal Mahadkar, director of Blood Money, was to direct the picture, but the following month it was announced that Mohit Suri had replaced Mahadkar as director at the last minute. Bhatt confirmed the development, saying \"Earlier we had finalised Vishal for the project. But now we have scrapped that idea and found a fresh one. We got Mohit to direct the film\". Several media outlets falsely reported that the film is a remake of the Vishesh films 1990 love triangle Awaargi. However, Mahesh Bhatt denied the rumours and said \"Aashiqui 2 is not a remake of any of our films. It's an original script. A very contemporary love story dealing with mature emotions.\" The film's producers launched a nationwide talent hunt to discover new faces for the film, initially refusing to employ established actors. However, the actors who came to audition were not promising enough for the roles, and the idea was scrapped. Mahesh Bhatt said, \"It was a disastrous talent hunt. We discovered that people lacked the courage to audition. Those who are amateurs went for audition ...and people with certain talent were like why should we risk public rejection.\" When Suri saw some pictures of Aditya Roy Kapur and met him, he found Kapur perfect for the role and cast him to play the male lead. In June 2012, Shraddha Kapoor was signed to play the female lead. Bhatt said, \"Yes, Shraddha Kapoor is playing the lead with the two boys Aditya Roy Kapur and Shaad Randhawa. We found her to be very talented. All three actors have extremely challenging dramatic roles.\" When asked about replacing new actors with known ones, Suri said \"People said I couldn't make a film with new actors and expect an audience to come in. But I was pretty sure I wanted Aditya and Shraddha to play my protagonists. My writer Shagufta Rafique and I saw them as the protagonists. See, Aditya and Shraddha may have had unsuccessful films before. But that never took away from their talent.\" Principal photography for the film began in October 2012 with film's lead cast. The film was shot in Goa, Mumbai and Cape Town. During the filming in South Africa, Shraddha Kapoor needed medical attention after kneeling on broken glass fragments during the scene in which she had to kneel on the floor and talk to her co-star Aditya Roy Kapoor. Aditya Roy Kapoor also received burns to his hand during the filming of the scene in which they light some Chinese lanterns in Cape Town. The first teaser was released on 22 March 2013, and was well received by critics and audiences. Unlike other films whose theatrical trailers are released first, the makers of the film chose to release the songs before the trailer. The first song, \"Tum Hi Ho\", was released on 23 March 2013 to unanimous critical reception from critics and became very popular among the audiences. The song became an instant hit with approximately 2 million views on YouTube within 10 days of release, which helped in the marketing of the film. Various versions of the song were uploaded by amateur singers, guitarists and DJs on social networking sites. It has been trending on Twitter and YouTube since its launch. The film's preview poster showing Aditya and Shraddha under a jacket in a rain-drenched street with the streetlight casting a glow was released along with music on 8 April 2013. At the music release event, Aditya and Shraddha recreated the scene from Aashiqui from under a jacket (much like the poster) on the stage. The theatrical trailer was released in mid-April 2013, two weeks before the film's release, and was well received by critics and audiences. Unlike most Bollywood films which indulge in months of promotion before the release, Aashiqui 2 had less than three weeks for promotion before its release. A music concert where singers (who sang songs in the soundtrack album) performed to their respective songs was organised to promote the film. The makers of the film launched the Aashiqui 2 jackets, as seen in the film's poster. Statues resembling the signature image of the couple hiding under the jacket were placed inside various theatres. Due to the romantic theme of the film, it was originally planned for a Valentine's day release on 14 February 2013, but this was postponed because of production delays. The film's new release date was 10 May 2013, but it was released a fortnight early on 26 April 2013 in over 2800 screens across India. The film was not released in key markets such as UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances, chemistry between the lead pair, and the music. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated the film 4 out of 5 stars, stating that it \"brings romance back on the Hindi screen\u00a0\u2013 intense, pure, selfless and heart wrenching. A stirring account with brilliant moments, bravura performances, strong emotional quotient and addictive music, this one's an absolute must watch for the romantics.\" He praised the lead cast's performances, writing that \" ...Aditya Roy Kapur's depiction of the intense character is outstanding...\u00a0[which] clearly demonstrates his potency as an artist of caliber and competence. Shraddha also gets to sink her teeth into this challenging character and the attractive youngster is simply amazing, more so towards the demanding moments in the second hour. Furthermore, the chemistry between Aditya and Shraddha is incredible.\" Indiatimes gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and said, \"Suri pitches the story with old-world romance, high-drama and well-crafted heart-breaking moments.\" Indo-Asian News Service rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, \"Director Mohit Suri traverses the angst-soaked territory with a sincere and deep understanding of the dynamics that destroy love and trust between couples in the glamorous and competitive profession\", and that, \"Aashiqui 2 makes us grateful for the movement of the love story away from the standard Romeo & Juliet format into the dark destructive domain of A Star Is Born.\" The film also received some mixed reactions from critics. Writing for Hindustan Times, Anupama Chopra rated the film 2.5 out of 5 and believed that the film didn't fulfill its potential, but said, \"It's an interesting scenario and Suri and his actors set it up well. Aditya gives Rahul's angst a certain charm. He is earnest and broken. And the real triumph here is Shraddha, whose porcelain face has a haunting vulnerability. She's very good as the woman in the throes of a grand passion who believes that love will show the way.\" Resham Sengar rated the film 2.5 and questioned the logic behind the script and believed that several of the scenes either dragged on excessively or were too abrupt, which affected the quality of the entire film. India Today also gave the film a rating of 2.5 stars out of four, and argued that the film was only a success because of its soundtrack, saying that the film \"merely banks on the power of saleable music and the novelty of a fresh cast to enable brothers Bhatt, Mahesh and Mukesh, [to] make maximum moolah within minimum budget as they have done all along.\" On its opening day, Aashiqui 2 collected about \u20b952.5 million (US$810,000) and collected \u20b9179.2 million (US$2.8\u00a0million) during its first weekend. The film collected \u20b9346.5 million (US$5.4\u00a0million) in its first week. In the second week, despite new releases, it collected \u20b9173.5 million (US$2.7\u00a0million), which took its two-week box-office collections to \u20b9470 million (US$7.3\u00a0million). It remained steady on weekdays and collected \u20b9165 million (US$2.6\u00a0million) in its third week and total collections rose to \u20b9635 million (US$9.8\u00a0million). The film had the highest third week collections of 2013 to that date. The film's revenues remained consistent in its fourth weekend and took its total to \u20b9710 million (US$11\u00a0million). Box Office India declared Aashiqui 2 a super hit after its three-week box office run. As of 20 May, it was the second-highest grossing Hindi film of 2013 and the highest-grossing film produced by Vishesh Films. According to Box Office India, Aashiqui 2 is the best trending film at the box office since 3 Idiots as the fourth week's collections were nearly \u20b975 million (US$1.2\u00a0million) nett, which was more than every film released in the last ten years apart from 3 Idiots. The fourth week collections were the third highest of all time. The film collected \u20b957.5 million (US$890,000) nett approx in its fifth week. The film went on to gross approximately \u20b9780 million (US$12\u00a0million) in its sixth week at the domestic box-office. Internationally, Aashiqui 2 collected around US$150,000 over the first weekend because its limited release meant it was only released in UAE and Pakistan. The film collected \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide in its fourth week. During its entire theatrical run, the film earned \u20b91.09 billion (US$17\u00a0million) worldwide.

However, being under the impression that Anu helped him with his career, his ego is hurt. This causes him to harbour a growing resentment toward her. Anu decides to further her career when the director Padamsee (Homi Wadia) persuades her to accompany him to Paris. When Rahul comes to stop her from boarding the flight, Anu stays behind to renew their relationship. Produced by Super Cassettes Industries Limited & Vishesh Films. Aashiqui was an all-time blockbuster at the box office in 1990 mainly due to its music, low budget and high grossing collection with the showings running to full houses. The music for Aashiqui was composed by the duo Nadeem-Shravan and lyrics were written by Sameer, Rani Mallik and Madan Pal. The songs in Aashiqui were recorded to make an album in 1989, but when Mahesh Bhatt heard them, he decided to make a film and he asked Gulshan Kumar for the same.[citation needed] Rakesh Bandhu of Planet Bollywood gave the album 9 stars saying, \"Aashiqui was a success in its own right. It is truly a beautiful collection of compositions by the Nadeem-Shravan.\" The soundtrack became very popular upon release, becoming the best selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year by a wide margin. With 1.50 crore (15 million) copies sold, it is the best selling soundtrack album in India of all time, as well as one of the best selling albums of all time in any genre in India.",

The film is notable for its inclusion of a rap-like song performed by Ashok Kumar, \"Rail Gaadi\".   The protagonist Jogi Thakur (Ashok Kumar) is a simple man of high principles. He is a resident son-in-law who, with his wife, has been bequeathed property and estates by his father-in-law. He breaks his marriage to an autocratic landlady (Veena) when he finds out that on her wife's order, the chief accountant of the estate has cunningly obtained his signatures on an order that the houses of the poor be burnt. He leaves home, vowing never to return as long as he lives, leaving his daughter Neena behind. He moves to Mumbai where he makes a living by entertaining children in a park (the famous song \"Rail Gaadi\", said to be India's first rap number). He is specially fond of a girl whose name, incidentally, is Neena (played by baby Sarika), too. Unfortunately, the girl takes ill and dies. Jogi then returns to his village, Chandanpur, where he finds that the daughter of one of his villager friends, Baiju, has been abducted. He rushes someplace where she is about to be raped by the estate's cunning chief accountant, and he kills him to protect the girl. The villagers make up a phony story to save him, but he opts to tell the truth in the court and is jailed. There, he starts tending to the garden and composes philosophical poems. The doctor at the jail, Dr. Biren (Sanjeev Kumar) takes a special liking to him. Coincidentally, Neena, Jogi Thakur's daughter is set to be married with the doctor. Jogi Thakur finds this out by chance as he is tending to the garden outside doctor's room and overhears their conversations. He also learns that his daughter hates criminals. And so he shields his face from her on the few occasions that they meet. Unfortunately, he takes ill just as he is granted pardon by the government for his good behaviour. The doctor, has come to think of him as a father figure. He tells Jogi Thakur that the day he will be out of jail will be the eve of his marriage. Jogi Thakur is taken by the desire to see his daughter being wedded, and hurries to see her. However, he does not want anyone to recognize him. Finally he joins the beggars who have gathered for a treat for the marriage, where his daughter and son-in-law are serving food. He manages to give his blessings to her and hurries out. However, as he collapses on the road, he is recognized and people gather around him. The news reaches his daughter who rushes to the spot to meet with her father at his last moment. Adorned with such wonderful songs such as Rail Gaadi Rail Gaadi Chhuk Chhuk Chhuk Chhuk Chhuk Chhuk Chhuk, Beechwale Station Bole Ruk Ruk Ruk Ruk Ruk Ruk Ruk Ruk, sung by Ashok Kumar himself, Ek Tha Bachpan by Lata Mangeshkar (sung by Jogi Thakur's daughter), and finally the memorable Jeevan Se Lambe Hai Bandhu Yeh Jeevan Ke Raste by Manna Dey (sung by the bullock-cart driver who carries Jogi Thakur near his village in the night), the movie is an emotional journey through a man's life who stands by his principles only to be overcome by love for his daughter in the end.

        "full_text": " Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (English: This Heart is Complicated) is a 2016 Indian romantic drama film written and directed by Karan Johar. It features Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma in lead roles. It was released on 28 October 2016 on the Diwali weekend.   In London, a chance meeting between Ayan Sanger and Alizeh Khan ends up with them kissing instinctively. Later, when they break up with their lovers, Lisa D'Souza and Dr. Faisal Khan, the two begin to spend time together at discos, restaurants and tourist places. While Ayan falls in love with Alizeh, she considers him to be a friend. One day, Alizeh stumbles upon DJ Ali, her ex-boyfriend, who wants to reconcile. Confused, Alizeh stops hanging out with Ayan and they cease communication. A few days later, Alizeh calls and invites Ayan to her wedding with Ali in Lucknow. Ayan is petrified on hearing this but agrees to the invitation. At the wedding, he tells Alizeh he loves her but she rejects his feelings causing Ayan to leave the ceremony heartbroken. At the airport to board a flight to Frankfurt, Ayan meets Saba, a poet, who is leaving for Vienna. She consoles Ayan and gives him a note with her poetry and number on it. Ayan calls after three months stating that he is in Vienna and wants to meet her. Saba meets him at a disco. Ayan learns that Saba is divorced and has no place for love in her heart. Ayan also meets Saba's ex-husband, Tahir Taliyar Khan in a gallery, who tells him that love is not a weakness but empowering. Ayan who had blocked Alizeh from everywhere, finally calls and reconnects with her. Ayan begins to send pictures of Saba to Alizeh to induce jealousy. One day Alizeh informs Ayan that she's coming to Vienna and wants to meet him. Ayan invites her for dinner, but Alizeh thinks Ayan has found love in Saba and is happy for him. Meanwhile, Saba begins to develop feelings for Ayan, but he loves Alizeh. Seeing his love for Alizeh, Saba leaves Ayan. Ayan continues to harbour love for Alizeh and becomes a famous singer. He meets Ali one day and realises that they have parted ways. Ayan goes to Alizeh's favourite point and waits there until she arrives. Alizeh tells Ayan that she is diagnosed with cancer stage IV and will not live much longer. Ayan and Alizeh try to make the best of their time together. Ayan tries to make Alizeh love him, but Alizeh is stubborn. This leads to a fight between the two, and Alizeh decides to leave him. Eventually, Ayan makes peace with the fact that he and Alizeh can at best be friends and nothing more. The screen blacks out and goes back to the beginning where Ayan, still a popular singer is giving an interview based on the love of his life. Ayan sings the song \"Channa Mereya\" which is inspired by Alizeh, then finishes the interview. \"...it is not a conventional love story or love triangle. It's a film that dwells deeply on relationships, heartbreaks and how love completes you, defines you and yet leaves you wanting for more. I have never had, in my entire career, a film that has come to me so fast, so organically and so from within.\" The film was first announced in November 2014. Writer-director Karan Johar said that for the past year and a half, he had been developing a story that he needed to work on for several months. However, while he was in New York, the idea for Ae Dil Hai Mushkil came to him and he wrote the screenplay in 30 days. When he came back to India, he spoke to the three lead actors and they all signed on immediately. Johar stated that he was motivated to cast Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma in the film after getting to know them by acting with them in Anurag Kashyap's Bombay Velvet (2015). He added that he was excited to cast Aishwarya Rai Bachchan after several unsuccessful attempts to cast her in his previous films like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). Actor Fawad Khan was cast to play a role of a DJ, describing his role as \"not exactly a cameo but it becomes a backbone for a certain conflict of a character in the movie.\" Lisa Haydon has also confirmed that she will appear in the film. In September 2016 at the Toronto International Film Festival, Johar confirmed that Shah Rukh Khan had also filmed a scene for the movie. In October 2016, he confirmed that Alia Bhatt would also make a cameo appearance in the film. \nOn 6 February at the India Conference at Harvard, Johar revealed that in the film Ranbir Kapoor plays the character of a Hindu boy named Ayan and Anushka Sharma plays a Muslim girl named Alizeh. Principal photography began in September 2015 with Kapoor and Sharma in London. At the end of September, the team filmed some portions in Paris. In October, they began shooting in various locations in Austria, including the city of Vienna. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan joined the crew in Vienna in mid-October after the release of her film Jazbaa. In March 2016, Kapoor, Sharma, and Khan were seen filming in Mandawa, Rajasthan. In July 2016, Johar tweeted a photo of Kapoor and Sharma on set in Mumbai for the last schedule. On 8 October 2016, Indian political party, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), proclaimed that they would not allow the release of the film, following nationwide protests surrounding the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir on 18 September 2016 and the decision by Cinema Owners Exhibitors Association of India preventing the release of films with Pakistani actors in four states \u2013 Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Goa. Citing the casting of Pakistani actor, Fawad Khan, in the film, the MNS warned theater owners around the country to not screen the film, threatening them with vandalism. Announcing that security will be tightened at theaters along with sufficient police protection, Maharashtra chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, commented on the issue, saying, \"Anyone found taking the law into their hands will be dealt with firmly.\" He also informed that 12 MNS members were sent to judicial custody after they barged into a Mumbai theater and held a protest on 19 October 2016. Commenting on the ruckus behind his film's release, director Karan Johar said that the circumstances in which the film was filmed in 2015 were completely different. \"Going forward, I would like to say that of course, I will not engage with talent from the neighbouring country, given the circumstance. But with that same energy, I beseech you to know one thing \u2013 that over 300 people in my Indian crew have put their blood, sweat, and tears into making my film, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. I don't think it's fair for them to face any kind of turbulence on account of other fellow Indians,\" he further added in a video statement. He was heavily criticized by news and social media for buckling under pressure. However, people from the film fraternity like Mukesh Bhatt and Shyam Benegal supported Johar and his film, and requested the people to consider the film and its release without giving importance to the actors' nationalities. On 20 October 2016, filmmaker Mukesh Bhatt said that his discussion with Union home minister, Rajnath Singh, had been consequential, and affirmed that the film will be screened throughout the country without any violence. However, he promised that he would not make any more films with Pakistani actors. Ae Dil Hai Mushkil was made on a total budget of over \u20b9100 crore ($15 million), including marketing and distribution costs. Prior to its release, the film had already recouped \u20b975 crore ($11.2 million) from music, satellite and digital rights, so it needs to recover only \u20b925 crore ($3.7 million) from the domestic box office. Worldwide, the film earned \u20b990.84 crore ($13.6 million) on its opening weekend, while ComScore reported an estimated $12.8 million from 14 markets. As of November, it has made $21.3 million worldwide. In India, its domestic market, the film had to compete with Shivaay which was released on the same day during the lucrative Diwali weekend. On its opening day the film made \u20b913.30 crore, the third biggest for both Kapoor and Sharma, and the sixth biggest for a Bollywood film of the year. Through its opening weekend, It scored a debut of \u20b935.60 crore ($5.3 million) net in its three days on 3,200 screens, equating to a gross \u20b949.84 crore ($7.65 million), the ninth-biggest debut of the year and the best ever debut for Johar, beating My Name is Khan \u20b931.50 crore ($4.7 million). On Monday, it saw a hike in ticket sales, earning \u20b917.75 crore ($2.65 million) due to holiday. In its first full week, the film earned \u20b980.19 crore ($12 million) in India alone and $20.2 million worldwide. The film continued to dominate the box office in its second weekend, earning $3.2 million from 2,000 screens (\u22121,200 screens). In just 10 days, the film earned \u20b997.17 crore ($14.6 million) net and has become the sixth highest-grossing Bollywood film in the country. Morever, the film now ranks as the highest-earner for Aishwarya, beating Dhoom 2's \u20b982.30 crore ($12.3 million) in 2006; the fourth biggest for Anushka as well as for Ranbir. In the United Kingdom, it recorded the biggest Bollywood opening of the year with \u20b94.88 crore ($772,891), debuting at eighth place at the U.K. box office. However, this is inclusive of previews. Including previews, Sultan would be the clear winner with a $1.3 million debut in July. But excluding previews, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil is ahead of the former. In the United States and Canada, the film received a limited release across 302 theaters and grossed \u20b914 crore ($2.13 million) in its opening weekend finishing in tenth place. As of 12 January 2017[update], the film has grossed \u20b9237.56 crore worldwide. Ae Dil Hai Mushkil received mixed to positive reviews, with most of the praise being directed towards the leading cast and soundtrack, while the plot and the direction had been met with mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 60% score based on five critic reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 40 out of 100, based on four critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Bollywood Hungama gave 4/5 ratings and commented, \"a contemporary and a progressive take on relationships from the master story teller Karan Johar\". Raja Sen and Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com respectively rated 4/5 and 3.5/5 and said, \"Thank you, Karan Johar for this film feels like a sob. Johar has improved massively as a storyteller, this film is more polished and assured than anything he's done before.\" and, \"As evident by his body of work, Karan Johar has a sweet spot for this attribute, in the splendidly romantic and richly satisfying ADHM.\" Nihit Bhave of The Times of India rated 3.5/5 and said, \"a beautiful-looking film that isn't bereft of logic\". Subhash K. Jha of Deccan Chronicle rated 2.5/5 and said, \"ADHM is one good looking film with actors who epitomise human beauty.\" Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times rated 2.5/5, saying \"ADHM offers little in terms of story and fails to get the audience empathise or feel for the characters and events in the movie.\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated 2/5 and said, \"Johar is unable to go the extra mile, hope that Johar will come up with something newer and sharper the next time around.\" Mike McCahill of The Guardian rated 2/5 and said, \"Despite controversy over the casting, Karan Johar's romance, has a failure of nerve about Hindu-Muslim relations.\" The Hindu commented, \"ADHM is the latest in the brand of cinema that isn't so much as plot driven as it is focused on characters, relationships and interactions.\" Reuters commented, \"ADHM has neither gravitas nor the charm to be worth remembering.\" Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, the film's soundtrack was released on 26 October 2016, by Sony Music India. Pritam composed the songs featured in the Soundtrack while the lyrics were provided by Amitabh Bhattacharya. The film had five initial promotional singles released from the soundtrack.

        "full_text": " Agneepath (English: The Path of Fire) is a 1990 Indian action drama film directed by Mukul Anand. It stars Amitabh Bachchan as the protagonist Vijay Deenanath Chauhan along with Mithun Chakraborty, Madhavi, Neelam Kothari, Rohini Hattangadi and Danny Denzongpa as the antagonist Kancha Cheena. The film was produced by Yash Johar. The title was taken from a poem of the same name called 'Agneepath' which was penned by Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Amitabh's father, and which is recited at the beginning of the movie and creates a thematic link that continues through the movie, particularly in the climax, both literally and metaphorically. Agneepath has grown a strong cult film over the years. Amitabh Bachchan received his first National Film Award for Best Actor at the 38th National Film Awards for his performance. Mithun Chakraborty received the Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award. The film was remade in 2012 with the same title, by Johar's son Karan Johar, as a tribute to his father. The film, despite being the tenth highest-grosser of 1990, had collections way below its high budget, and thus, the film recorded as flop at the box-office.   Much-loved village schoolmaster Dinanath Chavan (Alok Nath) strongly opposes the plans of Kancha Cheena a underworld don(Danny Dengzongpa) and his band of gangsters to set up a base for heroin smuggling. After being discredited in a set-up scandal and lynched by the manipulated villagers, his family is evicted and made destitute much to Cheena's advantage. Swearing revenge after his father's murder and the attempted rape of his mother Suhasini Chavan (Rohini Hattangadi) go unpunished, and with a burning desire to clear his father's name, his son Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) takes on the responsibilities of caring for his mother and sister Siksha (Neelam) that, by a strange twist of fate, cause him to become a gangster in his own right. Working his way up the ladder and attaining notoriety as an underworld kingpin, Vijay suffers an assassination attempt by fellow gangsters after he refuses to co-operate with their drug-smuggling operations. Left to die, he is discovered by Krishnan Iyer M.A. (Mithun Chakraborty) who transports him to hospital and saves his life, and who eventually finds employment as Siksha's bodyguard. During his time in hospital, Vijay is cared for by Nurse Mary Matthew (Madhavi). Vijay avenges his assassination attempt by killing his killers one by one, but his mother strongly disapproves of his murderous and gangster tendencies and drives him away from home after chastising him for dirtying the good name of his father. Vijay, hurt and upset, seeks solace in Mary's arms and begins a relationship with her. Siksha is then kidnapped and held in a slum by a gangster who wants to avenge the death of his associates killed by Vijay, and an unsuccessful rescue attempt by Krishnan ends up with the two of them brawling. Vijay hears of this and arrives to kill the gangster in a fit of rage. But this close encounter between Krishnan and Siksha causes a growing intimacy between the two of them and they fall in love with each other. Vijay is outraged and strongly protests against the relationship to his mother, but is rebuffed again when his mother disowns him a second time and considers Krishnan her \"good son\". Stung and deeply hurt by this slight, he again seeks solace in Mary and later marries her and resolves to do things \"in the right way\" to gain his mother's favour. After cutting a deal with Kancha Cheena to allow him access into his old village, Vijay sets in motion a number of strategies that undercut Cheena's criminal operations and gain him the legal ownership of the village. Revenge is a dish best served cold as Vijay informs Cheena of his identity as the son of Dinanath Chavan, lands Cheena in jail and arranges for Cheena's associates to testify against him in court. Vijay returns the village to his mother and finds himself back in her favour, but Cheena ensures his release by arranging for the witnesses to be gunned down and Vijay's family to be kidnapped and held hostage. This is the last straw for Vijay who is forced to return to his criminal ways and to walk the \"Path of Fire\" in order to rescue them. An almighty struggle takes place as Cheena bombs every building and demolishes the whole village before he is killed by Vijay's bare hands. But Vijay does not survive; he dies tragically of a bullet wound in the lap of his mother at the site of his old house. His mother realises that everything Vijay had done until then had been for the ultimate purpose of restoring the good name of Dinanath Chavan, and she weeps over his body piteously along with Krishnan, Siksha and Mary. A characteristic feature of the movie was the dark undertones and the grim atmosphere of the film, which was unusual for any of Amitabh Bachchan's films. It was noted that the film was \"grim\" due to the protagonist, Vijay Chavan's bloodlust and ferocity. The film utilised a lot of dark distortions in the imagery, which were a common theme in some Gangster Films. Mithun Chakraborty's unique role of Krishnan Iyer was inspired by one of his room mates of his struggling days, before he became a popular film star. In his struggling days Chakraborty used to be room sharing with Devio who used to pay 150 Rupees while Chakraborty Used to pay 75 Rupees. Devio had the a bed while Chakraborty used to sleep on the floor, one specific time Chakraborty used his bed whilst he was at work and when Devio came back he scolded Chakraborty. This incident remained with Chakraborty and he put Devio's character on screen. Tinnu Anand, who played the role of the Village Drunkard, shaved his head to obtain the age difference between him and Amitabh Bachchan. The film was shot extensively in Mumbai in several locations such as Andheri, Goregaon, and Colaba. The locations and the photography drew positive feedback from critics. When released, Agneepath was a failure, both at the box office as well as among the critics. However, Karan Johar recounts in an interview how younger city based audiences thought it was a cool film. \"Over the top, inane songs\", dialogues \"veering towards melodrama\" and, more importantly, Amitabh Bachchan's experimentation with his voice did not go well with the masses and the critics alike. Film Trade Analyst Komal Nahta wrote thus about Bachchan's voice,\u00a0: \"But the biggest undoing of the film is Amitabh Bachchan\u2019s voice. He has spoken the dialogue in a different voice (inspired by Marlon Brando in The Godfather) which will not be accepted by the audience. Further the mixing not being clear, his dialogues are incomprehensible at places.\" He further wrote that the film lacked a gripping drama, well-set script, and that even the Murder scenes lacked excitement. Satish Naidu in his review noted that the narrative had a slow pace in the last hour. Another fact that worked against the advantage of the film was its weak story. Rediff's review of Agneepath suggested that perhaps, the grim, violent, aggressive and dark portrayal of the underbelly of Mumbai's underworld had worked against the film. However, the National Award for the best actor being bestowed on Amitabh Bachchan changed the perspective in which the film was appreciated. Over the years, favourable reviews trickling in made Agneepath a cult classic. Currently, Agneepath has been rated 7.8 by on a scale of 10 in the Internet Movie Database by 1,723 users. In review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of 641 user ratings favour the movie. Sanjay Dutt, the actor who plays Kancha Cheena's role in the remake praised the film saying that it was well ahead of its time when asked about the original film- Satish Naidu commented in his blog that Agneepath's direction, camera work and cinematography \"had some serious physicality going for the film[there]\". He further drove home his opinion, describing the betrayal of a certain \"undeveloped terrain below\" by the jagged, staccato-like movements of the camera work. Further, Mr.Naidu praised the way in which Mukul Anand portrayed Amitabh Bachchan in the film. An interesting aspect of the film was its cinematography, handled by Pravin Bhatt, which has been described as \"marvelous\" due to the \"beautiful scenes shot in Mauritius. It is worth noting that the ship bombing scene was executed well, and that the portrayal of the picturesque scenery of trees and fields in full bloom(in the songs, especially) met with rave reviews. Movie Reviewer Peter Nepstad in his blog, the \"Illuminated Lantern\" wrote that: The movie's review in Rediff.com, mentioned that, According to trade website Box Office India, the gross collection of the movie was Rs 10,25,00,000, way below the film's budget of Rs 28,56,00,000. Thus, despite being the tenth top grosser of the year 1990, the movie was a disaster at the box office. All music composed by Laxmikant Pyarelal, Jean Michel Jarre. Rather unusually, for a Bollywood film of the time, a West African track was used in the film. Guinean singer Mory Kant\u00e9's hit Y\u00e9 k\u00e9 y\u00e9 k\u00e9 appears in the film, but is not on the soundtrack. In an interview with The Times of India, Karan Johar explained that he had the intention of remaking the original Agneepath ever since the film released 22 years ago, because according to him, the failure of the film broke his father's heart. The idea of the remake materialised on the sets of Johar's film My Name Is Khan in which Karan Malhotra was an associate director. Johar told Malhotra his desire to remake the original film and asked him to revisit it again for which he agreed immediately. Hrithik Roshan played the lead role of Vijay Deenanath Chauhan and Sanjay Dutt plays the role of the antagonist Kancha Cheena. Priyanka Chopra was the female lead. The character of Krishnan Iyer played by Mithun Chakraborty in the original was removed and Rishi Kapoor played a newly introduced negative character, Rauf Lala. Other members of the cast include Om Puri and Zarina Wahab among others. Shooting of the film mostly took place in Diu and Mumbai's film city. Originally slated for release on 20 January, Agneepath was postponed by a week to 26 January 2012. Unlike the original, the remake opened to positive responses from critics and the audience. Agneepath collected Rs 217.5\u00a0million (US$4.34 million) on the opening day. According to review aggregator Review Gang, professional critics have given the film a rating of 6.5 stars out of 10. The film did fantastic business at the box office and entered in 100 crore club. The film was also modified and remade in Tamil as Sivasakthi, starring Sathyaraj and Prabhu Ganesan directed by Suresh Krissna.",

However, after marriage, Kiran's ambitions take a back seat as she feels suppressed by her household responsibilities and looking after her son. Time fails to abate Kiran's frustration until she decides to leave Rohit and start a new life all over again. Now a loner, Rohit is forced to look after both his son and his own falling career. After some obvious teething troubles, Rohit succeeds in creating a separate world for himself and his son, Sunil. Meanwhile, Kiran becomes a huge film star.

A court case is eventually filed for the custody of Sunil. Rohit faces a tough time preparing for the case as his financial position is not as sound as Kiran's. He sells his best songs at a very low price so that he can fight the custody battle. During the court battle, Kiran's lawyer Bhujbal (Paresh Rawal) uses every possible trick to show that Rohit does not deserve the custody of his child.

        "full_text": " Amar Akbar Anthony is a 1977 Indian action comedy film produced and directed by Manmohan Desai. The film, which is based on the lost and found theme, is about three brothers separated from their parents and each other in childhood, and raised in three different faiths, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity. They unite in their youth to fight a common villain. It was the biggest blockbuster of 1977, and won several awards at 25th Filmfare Awards including Best Actor, Best Music Director and Best Editing. The film stars three actors: Amitabh Bachchan (as Anthony Gonsalves), Vinod Khanna (as Amar Khanna) and Rishi Kapoor (as Akbar Allahabadi). Each of the heroes had an affiliation with a heroine; these women were played by Parveen Babi, Shabana Azmi and Neetu Singh. Nirupa Roy, Pran and Jeevan played supporting roles. The music was composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal. Kishore Kumar sang for Bachchan and Mohammed Rafi sang for Kapoor. The soundtrack was one of Mukesh's last soundtracks with Laxmikant-Pyarelal. Anand Bakshi was the lyricist. The film about religious tolerance became a landmark in Bollywood masala films. It also had a lasting impact of the pop culture, with its catchy songs, one-liners and the character of Anthony Gonsalves played by Amitabh Bachchan. It was later remade in Tamil as Shankar Salim Simon (1978), in Telugu as Ram Robert Rahim (1980) and in Malayalam as John Jaffer Janardhanan (1982).   A chaffeur named Kishanlal (Pran) takes the blame for a fatal hit-and-run accident committed by his employer, the notorious mob boss Robert (Jeevan), on the assurance that his family's income will be tripled and their welfare looked after. He returns from prison to find his wife Bharati (Nirupa Roy) suffering from tuberculosis and his three sons starving. Seeking help from Robert for the sake of his family, he is ridiculed, humiliated and repudiated, until he turns on Robert and tries to kill him. Making his escape, Kishanlal inadvertently takes a car containing a shipment of gold bullion. Robert's goons give chase as Robert wants the gold back. Kishanlal goes home to rescue his family \u2013 only to find his wife's suicide note. Unknown to him, she fails and is struck blind. Kishanlal leaves his sons in a public park (at the foot of a statue of Gandhi) in order to draw off the pursuing goons to keep the boys away from harm. In the car chase that follows, he crashes and is presumed dead by the witnessing police, but is revealed to have survived. But by the time he returns to the park with the gold, his three sons have vanished. Amar (the middle son) has been nearly ran over by Robert's goons and rescued by a Hindu policeman; a Muslim tailor finds Raju (the youngest) and adopts him, naming him Akbar; and a Catholic priest (Nazir Hussain) finds Anthony (the oldest) asleep on the steps of his church and took him under his care. After 22 years, Amar (Vinod Khanna) becomes a policeman; Akbar (Rishi Kapoor) becomes a singer, and Anthony (Amitabh Bachchan) becomes a likeable, socially conscious scamp who runs quasi-legal operations and makes God his 'partner' by donating half his income to charity. The three meet when they donate blood for a hit-and-run victim, unaware that they are related that the recipient is their biological mother Bharati, who is currently selling flowers. In the meantime, Kishanlal used his gold to create his own criminal syndicate, destroying Robert's business and forcing a penniless Robert to work for him at a nearby dock. He also took in Robert's daughter Jenny as his niece before sending her to school in Europe. Robert becomes delighted to hear from Kishanlal that Jenny will return, but is distraught that Kishanlal won't let him see her, as he's still angry at Robert for making him lose his family. Eventually, the police arrives near Kishanlal's dock, forcing Kishanlal and his gang to disperse away from the scene. This allows Robert to escape away with another shipment of gold bullion, regaining his former place as mob boss and becoming Kishanlal's rival, determined to retrieve Jenny for himself and get back at Kishanlal for ruining his criminal empire. During the tide, each of the sons fell in love with the women they find: Akbar falls in love with his neighbor doctor Selma Ali, much to disapproval of Selma's father Tayyaib Ali, who later gives his blessings after Akbar saves him and Selma from a house fire. Amar falls in love with a one-time crook named Laxmi, taking her and her grandmother to his home after arresting her abusive stepmother. Also, Anthony falls in love with Jenny after meeting her in church. Around the same time, Bharati regains her sight at a Diwali festival in honor of Sai Baba hosted by Akbar, whom she recognized as her youngest son Raju. However, things get out of hand when Kishanlal is double-crossed by one of his bodyguards named Zubesko, who betrays Jenny to Robert in exchange for getting her hand in marriage, resulting Anthony's adoptive father to be murdered by Robert when he tries to stop them. Also, while witnessing Jenny's kidnapping, Laxmi ends up being kidnapped by her abusive brother Ranjeet, who is working for Robert. In their pursuit of justice against Robert, the brothers soon discover their mutual heritage with each other along with Kishanlal and Bharati, reuniting the family once again. Working together, the three brothers form a plan to bring Robert and his gang to justice. Posing as an elderly tailor, a one-man band, and a priest, the three brothers and Selma infiltrate into Robert's mansion, where Selma helps Jenny and Laxmi escape while the brothers finally reveal themselves and defeat Robert and the mobsters before sending them to jail for good. Despite justice being served for Robert and his gang, Kishanlal is sent back to prison for his past crimes, much to Bharati's dismay. However, Kishanlal comforts Bharati by telling her that their sons are reunited and have grown up, which is the only thing that matters to him the most. Kishanlal is then briefly released from his cell to share a heartfelt hug with his sons. The film ends with the three brothers and their loved ones happily riding into the sunset. The film was inspired by Pakistani diamond jubilee film Talash released in 1976 starring Shabnam, Nadeem and Babra Sharif. \"You see the whole country of the system is juxtapositioned by the haemoglobin in the atmosphere, because you are a sophisticated rhetorician intoxicated with the exuberance of your own verbosity.\" Prayag Raaj wrote the film's screenplay, with Kader Khan writing the dialogues. In a famous sequence, Anthony Gonsalves' jumps out of a large easter egg, wearing a black tuxedo complete with a top hat, monocle and umbrella. He speaks one of the most famous nonsensical dialogues in a mock accent, \"you are a sophisticated rhetorician intoxicated with the exuberance of your own verbosity,\" This was in part taken from 1878 speech by British politician Benjamin Disraeli, who made it while referring to another politician, W. E. Gladstone. The character Anthony Gonsalves played by Amitabh Bachchan was named after noted music arranger by the same name, whose pupils included R D Burman and Pyarelal of Laxmikant-Pyarelal, the composer duo of the film. The film was scheduled in such a way that the entire cast, which included the leading stars of time, didn't have to shoot together, except for the climax sequence and the title song, \"Anhony Ko Honi\", where they all performed together. It was shot over a period of a month at Ranjit Studios in Mumbai. However, the shooting went beyond this period, so Rishi Kapoor and Shabana Azmi had to leave towards the end for other films, hence their scenes were shot separately. The film's \"mirror band-aid\" scene was shot while director Manmohan Desai was absent. When Amitabh Bachchan was rehearsing the scene, Desai was committed to shooting the climax of Parvarish in another part of the same studio. He returned to find the scene shot. Some of the crucial scenes were shot at Mount Mary Church in Bandra, Mumbai. Desai's magnum opus extends religious pluralism, secular nationalism and also clear secularism motifs albeit complete with Bollywood masala. Three children were separated from their father on the Independence Day (15 August) who leaves them in a park under a statue of Mahatma Gandhi. These kids are subsequently raised by different parents, one grows up to become Anthony Gonsalves (Amitabh Bachchan), a Goan Christian, Amar Khanna (Vinod Khanna), a Hindu police officer, while the third and youngest child raised by Muslim parents, becomes Akbar Allahabadi (Rishi Kapoor), a Qawwali-singer. Their reunion in the end, completes the nationalistic allegory. In a crucial scene on the opening titles appear, three brothers of different religions, unknowingly donated blood to a blind woman, who is their mother, and are all united in the end, suggesting what was lost at independence, can be gained. The final dance number, \"Honi Ko Anhoni Karde\", which leads to films' climatic sequence, shows a masquerade song with the entire cast at villain's den. It highlighting that three religions are \"pillars of the nation\" and when they work together, they can beat any evil, their common villain in this case. The stereotype of suffering and self-sacrificing mother is also highlighted by some authors, played by actress Nirupa Roy, who regularly played such roles during the period. However, in her self-sacrificing streak, when she is afflicted to tuberculosis, she tries to commit suicide so that she doesn't become a burden to her family. However, this transgression of attempting to abandon her three young sons calls for a suitable punishment in the narrative and she loses her eyesight. The soundtrack was composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal, and the lyrics were penned by the veteran Anand Bakshi. The soundtrack of the movie proved as popular and successful as the movie itself. The vocals of the songs again have been given by some of the biggest names in the Indian music industry: Mohammed Rafi, Mukesh, Kishore Kumar, Mahendra Kapoor, Lata Mangeshkar, Shailender Singh and Amitabh Bachchan (sang in the song \"My Name is Anthony Gonsalves\"). For the song, \"Humko Tumse Ho Gaya Hai\" four leading playback singers, Mohammed Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar, Kishore Kumar, and Mukesh sang together for the first and only occasion. The film also features a comical qawwali, \"Parda Hai\" (There is Veil) sung by Mohammed Rafi. Desai had originally settled for the name \"Anthony Fernandes\" for Christian character to be played Amitabh Bachchan, though when he met lyricist Anand Bakshi, and the song \"My name is Anthony Fernandes\" was written, it didn't go well with music directors, Laxmikant-Pyarelal. That is when composer, Pyarelal recalling his violin teacher, composer Anthony Gonsalves, suggested an alternative Anthony Gonsalves, which was finalised. Shahid Khan of Planet Bollywood gave 9 stars stating, \"Overall, Amar Akbar Anthony is one of the finest examples of an album where the list of playback singers matches the star-power in the film\". The vinyl record was released on Polydor and was the first coloured LP: It was pink. The Emergency period declared in 1975, delayed the release of Desai's films, as a result in 1977, when Emergency was lifted, four of films, were released in the same year, this included, Dharam Veer, Chacha Bhatija, Parvarish and Amar Akbar Anthony. Incidentally, all of them were amongst the top-grossing films of the year. Film expert Rajesh Subramanian explains one of the earliest film merchandising strategy started with Amar Akbar Anthony. Three large Erasers with the photographs of Vinod Khanna, Rishi Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan, was sold in the market. It was a rage among school students. Posters, postcards and song booklets of the film adorned the shops. Men started sporting a metal cross around their neck. Even colourful vests, worn by Amitabh Bachchan in the film) became a vogue. Amar Akbar Anthony was Desai's first film as an independent film producer, it grossed \u20b9155 million (US$2.4\u00a0million) at the box office, was declared a blockbuster, and subsequently became highest grossing Bollywood film at the Indian Box Office for the year 1977.",

The film is noted for its music by R.D. Burman, numbers sung by famous playback singers like Kishore Kumar, R.D. Burman's father S.D. Burman and Lata Mangeshkar; lyrics were by Anand Bakshi. The thought-provoking song Chingaari Koi Bhadke written by Anand Bakshi and sung by Kishore Kumar, is one of the highlights of this classic. The song topped at 5th position on year-end chart toppers list Binaca Geetmala annual list 1972. The film is a remake of a Bengali film Nishi Padma (1970) directed by Arabinda Mukherjee, who wrote screenplay for both the films; it starred Uttam Kumar and Sabitri Chatterjee as leads. The film portrays the decline of human values and relationships and contrasts it by presenting an illustrious example of a boy's innocent love for a neighbourhood courtesan.   Pushpa (Sharmila Tagore) is expelled from her house by her husband and his new wife. When she refuses to leave, her husband beats her and throws her out. She goes to her mother for help but her mother too, disowns her. When she tries to commit suicide, she is sold to a brothel in Calcutta by her village-uncle, Nepal Babu (Madan Puri). On her audition at the brothel, Anand Babu (Rajesh Khanna), a businessman seeking love, is attracted by her singing. Anand Babu is unhappily married and lonely and becomes her regular and exclusive customer as love blossoms. Later a widowed man with his family, from the same village as her, moves in close to Pushpa's place. The new neighbour's son, Nandu, does not get any love at home, as his father works all the time and his stepmother does not care about him. Nandu's father learns about Pushpa's new life and forbids her from interacting with him and his family as he fears what people would say. However, Pushpa starts treating Nandu as her own son when she realises that he is mistreated at home, and often goes hungry. Nandu also comes to love Pushpa and starts to regard her as his mother. He visits her every day and comes upon Anand Babu who also becomes fond of him becoming a father figure, calling him Pushpa's son, seeing the way Pushpa loves the child. One day, Anand Babu's brother-in-law comes to see Pushpa and demands that she tell Anand Babu to stop visiting her. With great reluctance, Pushpa agrees and she turns Anand Babu away when he comes to see her. It is then that businessman realises that he is in love with Pushpa. When Nandu suffers from fever and his treatment is too expensive, Pushpa asks Anand Babu for help and he secretly finances the treatment and does not let anybody know. When the doctor asks him why is he so keen on helping Nandu, he replies some relationships have no names. However, when Nandu's father asks the doctor who paid for the treatment, the doctor says that his mother did. Then Nandu's father discovers that it was Pushpa who saved her son's life and he thanks her and gives her the sari that he had bought for his wife, telling her that it was gift from a brother to a sister. A touched Pushpa accepts. Nandu's family has to move to the village and Nandu plants a sapling of nigh-flowering jasmine (Harsingaar or Parijat) at Pushpa's home, making her promise to always take care of it. Pushpa cries and agrees. Several years later, Nandu grows up to become a government engineer posted in the same town. Anand Babu meets Pushpa, now working as a maid servant who is ill-treated and they both reconcile. Nandu unsuccessfully searches for her and gives up after inquiring in the neighborhood. Nandu's son gets sick and they go to the same doctor. Meanwhile, having met Pushpa, Anand Babu decides to catch up with all his old friends and meets the doctor. During conversation, he reveals he has stopped drinking and visiting brothels once he left Pushpa. He also tells him that he is now divorced/separated due to his wife's partying ways but is finally at peace and is happy with Pushpa's love and affection in his heart. They talk about Nandu and the Doctor informs him that Nandu is in town. Nandu meets Anand Babu when he comes to meet the doctor to ask regarding the medicine, who takes him to meet Pushpa. Both of them, unable to see Pushpa ill-treated, stand up for her and in the end Nandu takes Pushpa home with him, like a son who is reunited with his long lost mother with Anand babu looking on, crying happily. After making entertainers like China Town (1962), Ek Raaz (1963), Kashmir Ki Kali (1964), Sawan Ki Ghata (1966) and An Evening in Paris (1967) through the 1960s, with Aradhana (1969) and Kati Patang (1971), Samanta had entered the phase of emotional dramas in his career. Nishi Padma (Night Flower, 1970), for nightflowering-jasmine, was made by Arabinda Mukherjee with Uttam Kumar and Sabitri Chatterjee as leads. When Samanta saw the film, he was so impressed by the performance of Uttam Kumar, that he decided to remake it. However he decided to make some changes in the script. The original film was based on the Bengali short story Hinger Kochuri, written by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay, . The title derives its name from a typical Bengali late afternoon snack, kachori, made with of fried dough stuffed with lentils, and hing (asafoetida). The story was first published in Bandopadhyay's short story collection, Galpa Panchashat (Fifty Stories, 1956). His stories had previously been adapted by Satyajit Ray as Pather Panchali (1955) and the Apu Trilogy. Shakti Samanta asked Mukherjee who also wrote Nishi Padma's screenplay to write a Hindi version, with Ramesh Pant, a longtime-collaborator with Samanta penning the Hindi dialogues. The famous dialogue, \"Pushpa, I hate tears\" though also there in the original, was merely part of a dialogue, Samanta decided to use it to great effect, delivered in Rajesh Khanna's trademark style. Later both the writers of the film, won Filmfare Awards in their respective categories. Once the script was ready Samanta approached Sharmila Tagore with whom he had done a string of films, like Kashmir Ki Kali (1964), An Evening in Paris (1967) and most recently Aradhana (1969) with Rajesh Khanna. Tagore found her character Pushpa, \" a very strong role in the iconic mould of Mother India\", and instantly agreed, thus it was one of the first films she signed on after the birth of her son Saif Ali Khan. For the role Anand, actor Raaj Kumar was Samanta's first choice, as he believed Khanna who had become a super star after the hit Aradhana, wouldn't be interested in doing a film that focussed on the female lead. However, Khanna convinced Samanta that would do justice to the role. Though, Khanna changed the character's name from Ananta to Anand to draw connection to his character in Hrishikesh Mukherjee's critically acclaimed, Anand (1971). The film was shot in Eastmancolor, entirely at Natraj Studios in Mumbai, including the famous song, Chingari koi bhadke, which was set on a boat on the Hooghly River, with Howrah Bridge of Kolkata in the background. Earlier authorities in Kolkata didn't give the film crew permission to shoot under the bridge, as it would crowd problem. Thus the song was shot in a water tank in the studio, with the crew filming in knee-deep water. Samanta has been using music directors like O. P. Nayyar and Shankar-Jaikishen, but chose R. D. Burman once again after Kati Patang (1971), who also laboured to produce one of his best scores, later in an interview Samanta recalled, \"Pancham (R. D. Burman) would go into his room and work from 9 o'clock in the morning till 9 o'clock in the night for Amar Prem.\" Amar Prem takes forward the popular genre of self-sacrificing mother or woman prevalent in the decade as seen in Aradhana (1969) and Kati Patang (1971), though seen as early as in 1957 in Mother India, though here it places a wronged wife Pushpa in the narrative. When her husband marries the second time, due to her apparent infertility, she is kicked out of her home, her mother and community both abandon her, subsequently she is tricked into prostitution. Thus the fallen women ends up as courtesan, with a heart of gold; though the original version Nishi Padma (1970), clearly portrays her as a common prostitute, in Samanta's version she is a tawaif who sings to her customer for a living, as Pushpa is introduced to the audience singing a genteel mystic Meera Bai-like bhajan, Raina Beeti Jai, Shyam Na Aaye (Night is passing, Shyam (Krishna) hasn't arrived), calling on to Krishna; however in many part of the film she is treated by her environment as common prostitute. This blurring in representation of a courtesan and a common prostitute has been recurrent feature in mainstream Bollywood cinema, just as the theme of the fallen woman is. However, things were changing rapidly, only a few years later, Sharmila Tagore herself portrayed a far more realistic and feisty prostitute, in Gulzar directed, Mausam (1975), meanwhile B.R. Ishara had already made, bold film Chetna (1970), with Rehana Sultan, clearly ringing in the end of monochromatic filmi-version of prostitutes and courtesans, which was seen in films like Bimal Roy's Devdas (1957), B. R. Chopra's Sadhna (1958) and even in Guru Dutt's classic Pyaasa. As the film evolves, Pushpa is no longer the fallen woman; she is not just redeemed\u00a0\u2014 Anand Babu tells her, Tumne is kamre ko mandir bana diya (You have turned this room into a temple) - but in the end is deified, as she chooses to relinquish her profession and makes a living washing utensils, quietly suffering societal and psychological abuses all through the film, instead of fighting back or standing up for herself. This is also conveyed with the use of symbolism like the handful of mud being taken from Pushpa's brothel grounds to make goddess Durga idols prior to the annual Durga Puja festival, a popular festival of goddess worship. Further towards the end of the film her purity is compared with that of the Ganges itself by Anand Babu, when she finally visits the banks of Hooghly river, a distributary of the sacred Ganges River to break her bangles after her ill-treating husband dies; and in the very end, the juxtaposition of home-coming of Durga idols used in Durga Puja festival just as Nandu is taking Pushpa home. This makes her a veritable model for womanhood, although conservative and affirming patriarchal traditions. The fallen woman, solely longs to marry the man, but in vain, Pushpa too is reunited with Anand Babu in the end, however this only momentary meeting, Anand Babu suggests she goes home with her foster son, Nandu as a mother. This genre was in direct contrast with similar maternal melodrama of 1930s Hollywood where the abandoned mother often disappeared into oblivion and destitution; it continued in Hindi cinema for another decade, before the \"avenging heroine\" marked her entry and the women narratives began to change. The film also deals with the theme of urban melancholy, of the bhadralok, the gentlefolk, through Anand Babu, a businessman trapped in a bad marriage, whose wife is constantly busy in beauty-parlours and parties, and seeks company in Pushpa and alcohol. Pushpa herself lonely, fulfills her maternal instincts through Nandu, a young boy in the neighbourhood, often ill-treated by his step mother. Thus three lonely people become surrogate for each other and create their own family unit, even though briefly, as Anand Babu defines it, \"Koi agar apna na hoke bhi bahut apna ho, toh ise kya kehte hain? Bahut pyara rishta, na?\" (If someone is bound to you in spite of not being related to you, isn't that a lovely relationship?) Also through his song, Kuch To Log Kahenge, Anand Babu mocks society's moral judgement and hypocrisy, as he consoles a despondent Pushpa by singing, \"Sita bhi yahan badnaam hui\" (Even Sita (King Rama's wife in Ramayana) was insulted here) relating to an episode in epic, where in Sita having returned from captivity of demon king Ravana, she had to prove her purity, and was even then was banished by Rama to the forest. The score and soundtrack for film was composed by R.D.Burman, with lyrics by Anand Bakshi. Burman who was entering the most prolific period of his career was often criticized as a \"Western composer\" throughout his career, gave a surprising Indian classical music feel to the soundtrack, and established his versatility as a mature composer, thus silencing his harshest critics. The soundtrack was melody based, which gave Lata Mangeshkar her finest classical solo of the decade, Raina Beti Jaaye, set in an unusual blend of two Ragas, Todi in mukhara or the opening verse and Khamaj in the antara. Burman had heard his father, music composer S. D. Burman sing, Bela Boye Jaye, which he said was on his mind, while composing the song. Bakshi's lyrics, created a Meera bhajan like idiom for the song, employing the Krishna-Radha motif. With Amar Prem, Kishore Kumar also got an opportunity to establish himself with a generation of listeners used to Mohammed Rafi, as establishing his faith in Kumar capabilities to handle classical-based melodies, Burman gave him three songs, \"Chingari Koi Bhadke\" set to Raga Bhairavi, \"Kuchh Toh Log Kahenge\" in Khamaj and \"Yeh Kya Hua\" with a hint of Raga Kalavati. These three hits, along with the songs of Kati Patang including \"Yeh Shaam Mastani\" and \"Pyar Deewana Hota Hai\", released in 1971, Burman effectively and single-handedly ended Rafi's decade long reign as the top playback singer of the industry. However, when it came to \"Bada Natkhat hai Re Krishna Kanhaiyya\", things took a different turn when his father, veteran music director, S. D. Burman intervened and asked Burman to redo the tune. Burman was given the brief of \"usual bhajan situation\" by Samanta, later as he was giving final touches to the tune, his father heard the tune, and asked for the precise description of situation. On listening to the situation, he expressed his dismay as not doing justice to the situation, as R.D. Burman recounted in a later interview, \"But where's the composer in you in this tune, Pancham (Burman's nickname)?\" and went on to explain, \"..For Sharmila here is something more than the nautch-girl she plays. Her motherly instincts have been aroused by that kid. Your tune therefore must communicate all the agony of the nautch-girl wanting to be the mother she can never be. Do it again, your way, but with the moving human situation in mind.\" Thus R.D. Burman made a tune in Raga Khamaj, which Lata Mangeshkar too sang with marked emotional clarity and abandon, who is usually prone let her technical dexterity outshine. The song became a classic, and later Burman called it, \"his best lesson in music\" from his father. Finally, Burman roped in his father, S. D. Burman to sing \"Doli Mein Bithai Ke Kahaar\" in his typical bardic voice, and the song which appears twice in the film, was to become one of the most memorable songs of his career as a playback singer. Prior to the release of the film, a special show was organized in Delhi, where Gen Sam Manekshaw invited the cast, however the next day a blackout was declared, as the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 had begun. The film was commercial released in January 1972. Though 1972 was a year of big films, Pakeezah, Dushman and Beimaan upon its release, Amar Prem was eighth amongst Khanna's top releases in the year. Samanta achieved a hattrick of hits with Rajesh Khanna, which started with Aradhana (1969) and Kati Patang (1971). The music by R. D. Burman proved one of the best scores of his career, with hits like Chingaari Koi Bhadke sung by Kishore Kumar which reached 5th position at the year end toppers list, Binaca Geetmala annual list 1972, while another song, Yeh Kya Hua also sung by him reached the 9th position. The film went on to receive several awards and nominations. At the 1973 Filmfare Awards, Arabinda Mukherjee won the award for Best Screenplay, while Ramesh Pant won the award for Best Dialogue. Also Jehangir Nowrojee won the award for Best Sound. The film also won nomination in Best Actor category for Rajesh Khanna, Best Lyricist for Anand Bakshi - Chingari Koi Bhadke and Best Singer Male nomination for Kishore Kumar again for Chingari Koi Bhadke. The film also received nomination for Best Music, along with Pakeezah, Shor, however the award went to Be-Imaan which made a clean sweep at the award that year, by also winning Best Film, Best Director and Best Actor, a category for which Rajesh Khanna had won two nominations that year, for Amar Prem and Dushman, however he lost out to Manoj Kumar. Incidentally in the same year, Meena Kumari lost out the Best Actress Award to Hema Malini in Seeta Aur Geeta. After film's success, Rajesh Khanna-Sharmila Tagore pair which had already achieved success in Aradhana (1969), worked again in Yash Chopra's Daag (1973), Basu Bhattacharya's Avishkaar (1973), besides films like Chhoti Bahu (1971), Maalik (1972) Raja Rani (1973) . Today, they are still considered leading on-screen romantic couples in the 100 years of India cinema. Rajesh Khanna's dialogue \"Pushpa, I hate tears\",which appeared five times in the film, was not only parodied over the years, but also went on to become one of the epic dialogues of Indian cinema. Apart from her work with Satyajit Ray, lead actress Sharmila Tagore films with Samanta including Amar Prem defined her screen image for her career. The film's success also affect the fashion trends of the time, the puff sleeves blouses, which were first seen on Devika Rani in the 1950s were revived again after Sharmila Tagore's character Pushpa's wore them through the film. In July 2009, after Samanta's death in April of the same year, Amar Prem was inaugural film of a retrospective on Shakti Samanta Films organized in Delhi. ",

        "full_text": " Amrapali is a 1966 historical Hindi film, directed by Lekh Tandon, starring Vyjayanthimala and Sunil Dutt as leads. It was based on the life of Amrapali (Ambapali), the nagarvadhu (royal courtesan) of Vaishali in present-day Bihar, the capital of the Licchavi republic in ancient India around 500 BC and Ajatashatru, the Haryanka dynasty king of the Magadha empire, who falls in love with her. Though he destroys Vaishali to get her, she in the meantime has been transformed by her encounter with Gautama Buddha, of whom she becomes a disciple and an Arahant herself. Her story finds mention in old Pali texts and Buddhist traditions. The film was selected as the Indian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 39th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. Though the film wasn't a commercial success, in time it started being seen as classic and is remembered not just for its dramatic cinematography of war scenes by Dwarka Divecha, and Bhanu Athaiya's costumes for which she travelled to the Ajanta Caves, to seek references in Buddhist frescoes of the era, to create period costumes that subsequently became a template for costumes of that era, but also for the strong Anti-war sentiment, the film reveals in the end.   Another highlight of the film was its music by the duo Shankar Jaikishan, then at the peak of their career, who gave a highly restrained yet fully Indian classical music-based score in the four songs, another rarity in the period film of the era to have so few songs. All the song were sung by Lata Mangeshkar who also has some of her career's finest among them, including, \"Tumhen Yaad Karte Karte\", \"Neel Gagan Ki Chhaon Mein\" and \"Jao Re Jogi\". A scene clipping from the film, was used in the Dhoom tana song dance sequence in film Om Shanti Om (2007), wherein Deepika Padukone dances as Vyjayantimala, who was digitally removed from the frames, as Deepika was playing the role of an actor of the 1970s.",

        "full_text": " Anand (English: Bliss) is a 1971 Indian drama film co-written and directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee. It stars Rajesh Khanna in the lead role with and supporting cast includes Amitabh Bachchan, Sumita Sanyal, Ramesh Deo, Seema Deo. Khanna played the title role. The dialogues were written by Gulzar. The film won several awards including the Filmfare award for best film in 1972. In 2013, it was listed in Anupama Chopra's book \"100 Films To See before You Die\".This film is counted among the 17 consecutive hit films Rajesh Khanna between 1969 and 1971, by adding the two hero films Marayada and Andaz to the 15 consecutive solo hits he gave from 1969 to 1971.   The film begins with a felicitation ceremony arranged for Bhaskar (Amitabh Bachchan), a doctor who has just written a successful book titled Anand. Bhaskar was a cancer specialist and after the congratulatory speeches, he reveals that the book is not a work of fiction but taken from his own diary and pertains to his experiences with a real person named Anand. Flashback starts with Bhaskar, little fresh from his training as an oncologist, trying to treat the poor for no charge but often gets disheartened by the fact that he cannot cure all the ailments in the world. He becomes pessimistic after seeing the suffering, illness and poverty all around him. He acts straightforward and would not treat the imaginary ailments of the rich. But his friend, Kulkarni follows a little different path. He treats the imaginary illnesses of the rich and uses that money to treat the poor. One day Kulkarni introduces Bhaskar to Anand (Rajesh Khanna) who has lymphoma of the intestine, a rare type of cancer. Anand has a cheerful nature and despite knowing the truth that he is not going to survive for more than six months, he maintains a nonchalant demeanour and always tries to make everyone happy around him. His cheerful and vibrant nature soothes Bhaskar, who has a contrasting nature and they become good friends. Anand's condition gradually deteriorates but he does not want to spend his remaining time in the hospital bed; he instead roams freely and helps everyone. He discovers that Bhaskar has strong feelings for Renu (Sumita Sanyal), whom he treated previously for pneumonia. He helps Bhaskar to express his love and convinces Renu's mother for their marriage. He tells Bhaskar that everyone should remember him as a lively person and not as a cancer patient. His end comes and he dies amongst his friends and everyone remembers him as a vibrant and lively person. Bhaskar becomes more philosophical and continues to help the helpless with more empathy and maturity. Anand was originally supposed to star actors Kishore Kumar and Mehmood in lead roles. One of the producers, N.C. Sippy, had earlier served as Mehmood's production manager. The character Babu Moshai was to be played by Mehmood. Mukherjee was asked to meet Kishore Kumar to discuss the project. However, when he went to Kishore Kumar's residence, he was driven away by the gatekeeper due to a misunderstanding. Kishore Kumar (himself a Bengali) had done a stage show organized by another Bengali man, and was involved in a dispute with this man over financial matters. He had instructed his gatekeeper to drive away this \"Bengali\", if he ever visited the house. The gatekeeper mistookd Mukherjee to be this \"Bengali\", and refused him entry. The incident hurt Mukherjee and he decided not to work with Kumar. Consequently, Mehmood had to leave the film as well. Both Raj Kapoor and Shashi Kapoor were offered the lead before Rajesh Khanna. Film expert and musicologist Rajesh Subramanian says that Mukherjee shot the film in 28 days. The screenplay of Anand was written by Gulzar (who also wrote dialogues and lyrics of a few songs), Bimal Dutt, D.N. Mukherjee and Hrishikesh Mukherjee. The character of Anand was inspired by Raj Kapoor, who used to call Mukherjee \"Babu Moshay\". It is believed that Mukherjee wrote the film when once Kapoor was seriously ill and Mukherjee thought that he may die. The film was dedicated to Kapoor and the people of Bombay. Later, Anand was remade in Malayalam, with the name Chitrashalabham, starring Jayaram and Biju Menon. The musical score for the film was composed by Salil Chaudhary. The lyrics were written by Gulzar and Yogesh. Gulzar wrote the poem \"Maut Tu Ek Kavita Hai\" which is narrated by Amitabh Bachchan. Before confirming Chaudhary as the film's music director, Mukherjee approached Lata Mangeshkar for the job as she had already worked as a music director in Marathi films under the pseudonym of \"Anandghan\". She, however, politely refused the offer and decided to sing the songs in the film rather than composing them. Although Kishore Kumar had become the voice of Rajesh Khanna since the success of Aradhana, in this film, music director Salil Choudhury insisted that Mukesh's voice would give the required pathos to Anand's character. Rajesh Khanna readily agreed to the suggestion. Once when asked which song was his favorite, Rajesh Khanna said it was Mukesh's song 'Kahin Door Jab Din Dhal Jaye' from Anand. Numerous DVD editions entered the market by companies like \"Digital Entertainment inc.\", Shemaroo Entertainment and \"Eagle Home Video\". These were released as non-restored, non re-mastered editions and bare bones, void of supplementary features. Eagle Home Video came out with a restored edition of this movie, preserving the original aspect ratio in 4:3 pillar box and a DTS Master Audio (HD) in 2.0. The restoration took place in Shemaroo studios.",

The film was directed by Ramesh Sippy. The film was a considerable success and important in the career of Malini as an actress. The film features \"Zindagi Ek Safar Hai Suhana\", one of the best known Bollywood yodels which also featured on the soundtrack of Mira Nair's Mississippi Masala. The song fetched singer Kishore Kumar a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer. When this film released, films of Shammi Kapoor were not doing well at the box office. The 10-minute cameo including made by Rajesh Khanna is credited for turning Andaz (1971) into a hit film. This film is counted among the 17 consecutive hit films Rajesh Khanna between 1969 and 1971, by adding the two hero films Marayada and Andaz to the 15 consecutive solo hits he gave from 1969 to 1971. Further this film is the first of the successful script writing that Salim-Javed started.   This film tells the story of a widow Sheetal (Hema Malini) who is left devastated after the death of her husband Raj, (Rajesh Khanna). She is left with a son to look after and teaches in a school. One of her students is the daughter of widower Ravi (Shammi Kapoor). The children become instrumental in getting the single parents to meet and fall in love with each other. Andaz was one of the last movies for which the great music directors duo, Shankar- Jaikishan composed music together. Jaikishan died of liver cirrhosis on 12 September 1971 at the young age of 42. \"Zindagi Ek Safar Hai Suhana\" (Life is a beautiful journey) turned out to be the last song that Jaikishan recorded before his death. Andaz also proved to be the last hit for Shammi Kapoor as a lead. The success of this movie is credited to the Rajesh Khanna Mania of the 70s, as Rajesh Khanna only appeared for 15 minutes in the movie, and still created a stir. However, Shammi's performance was well received and it is considered to have been one of the most uncharacteristic roles in his acting career. So also, Ajit played a sympathetic man who repents for his mistake not to accept Hema Malini as his daughter in law after the death of his son Rajesh Khanna. ",

        "full_text": " Andaz Apna Apna (translation: Everyone has their own style) is a 1994 Indian Hindi-language comedy film directed by Rajkumar Santoshi, starring Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon, Karisma Kapoor and Paresh Rawal in the lead roles. Mehmood, Govinda and Juhi Chawla make guest appearances. The film was released on 4 November 1994. The plot elements of this movie were later used in other language movies such as Ullathai Allitha (1996), Veedevadandi Babu (1997) and Galate Aliyandru (2000), though none being frame to frame remake. The film was an average grosser at the box office, but has since emerged as a cult film over the years.   Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan) are two daydreamers with a common aim: getting rich by marrying a rich heiress, Raveena Bajaj (Raveena Tandon), daughter of Ram Gopal Bajaj (Paresh Rawal). The guys run into each other on a bus and soon realise that they have a common goal. The duo then fails at various attempts to woo the lady. Meanwhile, they decide to insinuate themselves in her house. Amar pretends to be a guy who has lost his memory after getting hit by Raveena, while Prem pretends to be a doctor. The boys don't know that Raveena's secretary Karishma (Karisma Kapoor) is the real Raveena and Raveena's actual name is Karishma. Raveena switched her identity because she wanted to find a boy who will love her, not her money. Nobody is aware that Ram Gopal has a twin brother called Shyam Gopal Bajaj aka Teja. Teja is a criminal who has taken lots of money from Crime Master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor). Teja hopes to land the riches himself by kidnapping his brother and posing as Ram. He has also planted his cronies Robert (Viju Khote) and Bhalla (Shehzad Khan) in the household. Ram arrives in India & Teja plans to steal Ram's money converted in diamonds. Here, Ram sees through the real nature of Amar, Prem and Raj thus declining Raveena's marriage to either of them. The duo plan to fake a kidnapping where they will heroically \"rescue\" Ram. Unknown to them, Teja has planned to kidnap Ram as well. Teja succeeds in having Ram kidnapped. The boys go to rescue Ram, but Teja makes them believe that he is Ram and finally enters Ram's household. Initially, nobody suspects a thing, but the girls soon smell a rat. The boys have discovered real identities of the girls. Prem has fallen for real Raveena while Amar has fallen for real Karishma. The girls tell their suspicions to the boys. The boys tail Teja and soon find out the truth. Here, Ram tricks Teja and escapes the prison. However, the boys mistake him for Teja, resulting in Ram being imprisoned again \u2013 with Amar and Prem. However, Amar and Prem succeed in convincing Robert & Bhalla that Ram is actually Teja. The boys, along with Robert & Bhalla, stop Teja. However, Ram is kidnapped along with Raveena & Karishma. The climax takes place in Gogo's lair, where the boys try to control the situation along with Ram. In a comic standoff, the real motive of each villain is revealed. However, due to the smartness of the boys, police raid Gogo's lair, thus rounding up all the criminals. Ram finally decides to have the raveena and karshima marry to Amar and Prem. The film's producer Vinay Sinha approached writer-director Rajkumar Santoshi with the idea of making a film with Aamir Khan. Having made two back-to-back serious films like Ghayal (1990) and Damini \u2013 Lightning (1993), Santoshi wanted to make a comedy film. It was then decided that he would script a funny film about two warring buddies, the human versions of Tom and Jerry. He then decided to bring Salman Khan to the party followed by then relative newcomers Karishma Kapoor and Raveena Tandon as the female leads along with Paresh Rawal in a double role. Santoshi started writing the script after the casting. Initially Salman Khan wanted more screen space than the other, but later agreed to have the same amount of screen time. Tinnu Anand was offered the role of the villain \"Gogo\", but could not do it because of date issues. It eventually went to Shakti Kapoor. The Muhurat shot was done by cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. Andaz Apna Apna took three years in making, and several scenes were improvised by the actors on set. The film did not do well at box-office; it recovered its cost mainly due to business from big cities, but did not turn out to be a massive hit contrary to everyone's expectations. It earned an excess of \u20b95 crore (US$770,000). The lack of publicity and tough competition from other films of that year including Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!, Krantiveer and 1942: A Love Story were reasons for it to fail. All of these films were very strong in their box office presence and Andaz Apna Apna, belonging to a different genre, could not compete well. It has however in subsequent years, achieved a cult classic status among Hindi audiences. Each dialogue and character of the movie are immensely likeable and have terrific recall. On the video circuit and TV, it has become one of the most popular Indian movies over the years. Several dialogues from this film like \"Teja main hu. Mark Idhar hai\", \"Crime Master Gogo, Mogambo ka Bhatija\", \"Do dost ek cup me chay piyenge\" etc., are popular. It went on to be an inspiration for the plot element of the Tamil movie Ullathai Allitha, Telugu movie Veedevadandi Babu and the Kannada movie Galate Aliyandru. It was also reported that the climax of 1973 movie Victoria No. 203, including the set and the action, was shot-to-shot copied in this movie. While reviewing Grand Masti in 2013, critic Khalid Mohamed described Andaz Apna Apna in the \"collection of excellent comedies\" from Hindi cinema. Film critic Raja Sen called it a \"cornball classic\" and \"one of the greatest comedies in recent times.\" In 2014, comedian Aditi Mittal wrote: \"Writing about Andaz Apna Apna, I have realised, is like writing about mother\u2019s love. Everyone has their own version of how it affects them, what lines they remember the most.\" The film has four songs composed by Tushar Bhatia with lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri. * Song was not included in the movie though appearing on the soundtrack. The plot elements of the movie were used in many languages as Ullathai Allitha (1996), Veedevadandi Babu (1997) and Galate Aliyandru (2000). Andaz Naya Naya is a Bollywood animated 3D film, which is an official remake of Andaz Apna Apna, but it has been shelved due to some reason. Producer Sidharth Jain began to question if the film would do any good at the box office because Indian animated films do not get good market, so Jain shelved the film after being 35% done. On the completion of 20 years of Andaz Apna Apna, director Rajkumar Santoshi said in an interview that he is considering a sequel of Andaz Apna Apna as demand for sequel is unbelievable. He said that bringing Aamir Khan and Salman Khan together may be economically and logistically impossible, so he may take young actors to reprise roles of Amar and Prem. Raveena Tandon, who featured in the film, stated that she does not believe in a sequel, and would prefer a cartoon remake rather than a feature film. ",

He comes across Shivani again and Ashok who have a daughter named Pinky. Vijay befriends Ashok with fake airline project as the hope of getting closer to Shivani. Ashok is totally oblivious to Vijay's real intentions, to the extent that he does not believe Shivani when she tries to convince him of what Vijay is planning against them. One day, Ashok kicks Shivani out of their house after they have an argument. Vijay witnesses this and severely beats Ashok, leaving him unconscious. When Ashok is being treated in the hospital, Vijay removes the oxygen mask keeping Ashok without oxygen supply, thereby killing him.

Whilst they embrace, she stabs him and then starts attacking him for everything he did. She confesses that she made him better for one purpose: to kill him. (She says it's a sin to kill a handicapped person, who cannot defend himself.) Eventually, they both dangle from a cliff (with Vijay holding onto Shivani\u2019s foot). Vijay says that if he falls to his death he'll take Shivani with him. Deciding that it is not necessary for her to live as long as Vijay is dead, Shivani lets go of the ledge causing both of them to fall off the cliff to their deaths. Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood gave the album 7.5 stars stating, \"Anjaam\u2019s tunes are overall a mix fare but the songs that were sweet and melodious were enough to project the soundtrack to higher standards. The only song sung by Abhijeet in this album \"Badi Mushkil hai\" is considered one of the most melodious song till date \".",

It was voted as the best film of the year by the Filmfare Awards. Sharmila Tagore would win her first Filmfare Best Actress Award for playing the lead role in this film. Originally released in Hindi and dubbed in Bengali, Aradhana's huge success led to two remakes, both starring Vanisri in Tagore's role: the Tamil film Sivakamiyin Selvan (1974) and the Telugu film Kannavari Kalalu (1974).This film is counted among the 17 consecutive hit films of Rajesh Khanna between 1969 and 1971, by adding the two hero films Marayada and Andaz to the 15 consecutive solo hits he gave from 1969 to 1971.   In an idyllic hilly terrain, Indian Air Force officer Arun Varma (Rajesh Khanna) sings \"Mere Sapno Ki Rani\" atop an open jeep along with his co-pilot Madan (Sujit Kumar), while Vandana (Sharmila Tagore), the daughter of a doctor Gopal Tripathi (Pahadi Sanyal) demurely sneaks glances at him from a mini train. After a brief romance, they have a secret wedding. Soon afterwards, Arun dies in an air crash leaving behind a heartbroken and pregnant Vandana. His family refuses to accept the unwed mother-to-be since her marriage with Arun is never formalised. Meanwhile, her father also dies, leaving her destitute. Vandana's son is finally born, but she is forced to let a childless couple adopt him. Determined to be a part of his life, she accepts the responsibility of becoming his nanny. The boy is named Suraj. Her employer's brother Shyam (Manmohan) arrives and lusts for Vandana. He tries to rape her when no-one is around, but Suraj arrives and stabs him to death to save his nanny. When the police arrive, Vandana takes the blame for the murder and is arrested while Suraj runs away and forgets this mishap as he grows up. Several years later, when Vandana is released from jail she is befriended by the jailer (Madan Puri) who takes her home and introduces her to his daughter Renu (Farida Jalal). Vandana comes face to face with Suraj (Rajesh Khanna) when she discovers that Renu is dating him. Suraj, just like how his father wished, is an air-force officer. He slowly starts remembering that he has seen Vandana somewhere, although Vandana wants to hide the truth as she feels Suraj may be embarrassed upon realising his parent's background and history. Vandana makes herself home at the jailer's house. Suraj is injured in an air crash like his real father Arun, but survives. While he is recuperating in the hospital, Vandana meets Madan, who knows that Suraj is Arun and Vandana's son. He wants to tell Suraj the truth, but Vandana denies wanting to let Suraj know that he is her son, fearing the consequences. Later when Vandana is not around, Suraj sees her diary where Arun's photo is found. Realising that Arun and Vandana are his true parents, he salutes Vandana's self-sacrificing attitude and accepts her as his own mother. The film was scripted by Sachin Bhowmick. The theme of the movie was based on the 1946 movie To Each His Own. A day prior to the shooting of Aradhana, producer Surinder Kapoor showed Samanta his latest film, Ek Shrimaan Ek Shrimati with Shashi Kapoor as the lead which was also written by Sachin Bhowmick. Much to his surprise this film had similar ending as his own film. The following day Samanta decided to scrap his film, when writers Gulshan Nanda and Madhusudan Kalelkar visited his office. Upon hearing the issue, it was Gulshan Nanda who suggested to have a double role of father and son in the film. Originally the first hero was to die by the interval and a new hero was to step in. The same evening, while Aradhana was being cancelled, Nanda recited a story of Kati Patang to Samanta, which he instantly liked, so for the next couple of hours they first rewrote the second half of Aradhana, and subsequently went on to discuss, Kati Patang. The \"Roop Tera Mastana\" song sequence, which lasted more than three minutes and 30 seconds, was filmed in a single take. Sharmila Tagore believes this was done due to time constraints. The soundtrack of the film was composed by S. D. Burman, with lyrics by Anand Bakshi. Burman had already written the music for the songs of Aradhana and had started recording the songs, but became very ill shortly after composing the lyrics of the songs. The responsibility for finishing the background music soundtrack fell upon his son R. D. Burman. Kishore Kumar sang the popular songs \"Roop Tera Mastana\" and \"Mere Sapnon Ki Rani\". According to music and film expert Rajesh Subramanian, in \"Roop tera mastana\", Kersi Lord played the accordion, Homi Mullan played the duggi and Manohari Singh played the saxophone.",

The screenplay of both movies was by Vijay Tendulkar, the noted Marathi playwright; this one was based on the short story, 'Surya', by S.D.Panvalkar, and featured dialogues by Vasant Dev. In this acclaimed cop-drama, the protagonist, played by Om Puri, is a policeman struggling with the evils around him and with his own frailties. The film also stars Amrish Puri, Smita Patil, Naseeruddin Shah, and Sadashiv Amrapurkar, and features a theme poem by the Marathi writer Dilip Chitre. Nihalani was looking for a new actor to play the role of Rama Shetty when writer Tendulkar convinced him to see the play of Amrapurkar. It was a marathi play called \u201cHands Up\u201d. The title of the film came from a poem written by Dilip Chitre. Ardh Satya won many awards and went on to become a landmark film in Indian film history. It is still considered to be one of the best cop films made in India. A sequel titled Party was released in 1984.   The film opens at a party where Anant Welankar (Om Puri), a police officer, meets Jyotsna Gokhale (Smita Patil), a lecturer in literature at a local college. Anant is a sub-inspector with Bombay police. They seem to hit it off despite some initial skirmishing about ideology, and the friendship blossoms into a relationship. Anant brings diligence, enthusiasm and a definite idealism to his job. But the job is harsh. There is a deep nexus between the local mafia, the cops and the (corrupt) politicians. Honest himself, Anant falls among the lower rungs of the police hierarchy and has very limited scope of authority on the state of affairs in his area. When Anant arrests three common thugs, he is asked to meet with their boss, Rama Shetty (Sadashiv Amrapurkar), a don in the local mafia. Anant refuses all of Rama Shetty's attempts to get his men out or to entice Anant to join him. Shetty decides to watch over Anant. Some time thereafter, a meek fellow from a local slum lodges a complaint about some ruffians who harass his wife. Anant finds them, locks them up, and administers a severe beating. As a fallout, the local MLA asks for Anant to be suspended. Anant's boss, inspector Haider Ali, explains to a mystified Anant that the ruffians were the MLA's henchmen, providers of muscle during elections and political rallies. Anant is defiant with a clear conscience (he did nothing wrong) and ready to face a tribunal. Haider Ali explains that it will hardly get that far. Tribunals are either delayed indefinitely or are rigged (by corrupt politicians), and suspension during that time is a permanent black mark on one's record (for no other politician will be willing to deal with such a troublemaker). Anant is initially baffled but goes along with Haider's plan to bring in Desai, a mediator or middle-man with connections in New Delhi, the \"Centre\" or national seat of power. Desai invokes higher powers to quietly cover up the matter. Anant's morals are shaken by this incident: He had to use means barely legal to uphold his righteous actions upon criminals. Anant reflects upon his childhood. His father (Amrish Puri) retired as a Faujdar (constable) in the village police force. His father was a hard and violent man, quick to slap or beat his wife on the slightest pretext. Anant recalls looking on and being powerless to intervene. When Anant graduates college, he expresses his desire to pursue higher education but is forced into joining the police force. Things get interesting when Anant finds one of Rama Shetty's goons, badly beaten, burnt and left to die. Anant brings the man into the hospital and takes his statement where he names Rama Shetty and others who inflicted this assault. Anant storms into Rama Shetty's rooms to arrest him. But Shetty is unfazed. He makes a simple phone call to a high ranking cop who immediately asks Anant to back off. Anant cites the context and the overwhelming evidence but is still ordered to step away. A consternated, resentful and hapless Anant leaves, feeling intensely humiliated. Haider Ali explains yet again: Rama Shetty plans to run for city council in the upcoming municipal elections and simply cannot afford to let a petty matter distract his ambitions. Anant is horrified and enraged, and takes to drinking. His relationship with Jyotsna suffers. He is distraught when he is sent to provide security cover for Rama Shetty's campaign rallies. He suffers another career setback when he leads an assault team to capture a dangerous daku (armed bandit) in the hills outside Mumbai, and the credit for the arrest is ultimately handed to another officer. His relationship deteriorates further and he takes to drinking fairly heavily. When Jyotsna confronts him, he confides in her. Jyotsna tries to be supportive and suggests he consider another career. (She is motivated by recent news stories about police brutality and has decided that she will not marry a police officer.) He has always tried to do the right thing, but his well-intentioned actions always seem to be thwarted by the tentacles of corruption in the police force or the political strata. In the alcoholic trans a prisoner is killed by Anant in the jail when he uses 'third degree' and now Anant is not only likely to be arrested and jailed, but also has to lose his entire career. Finally he surrenders to Rama Shetty for political protection. Now, in the clutches of Rama Shetty, Anant has to obey his every order and humiliation. The dirty conditions put by Rama Shetty angers Anant and he kills Rama Shetty and then surrenders voluntarily to the Police for any punishment. According to film expert Rajesh Subramanian, Amitabh Bachchan was first offered the lead role. The superstar, due to tight schedule, declined it. Om Puri was cast as Anant Welankar and it went on to become a career defining role. In a pivotal scene, from which the movie derives its name, Jyotsna gives Anant a poem to read to him from a book that she is carrying, Ardh Satya (see below for transliteration). Anant begins to read the poem aloud; as the meaning sinks in, his smile vanishes; he continues reading in a more subdued and sombre tone. Filmed in a single long take, this is one of the finest moments world cinema has shown portraying the effect of art upon man in modern cinema (compare to Apres Nous). Later in the film, a cathartic moment occurs symbolising the poem, where Anant breaks down crying. Jyotsna reaches out a hand to comfort him but then withdraws it without touching him, in one of the most poignant moments of cinema; it is as if she realised that he is \"within this Chakravyuh, or Circle of Deceit\" alone and needs to find his inner strength to break out. Govind Nihalani said in an interview on Indian TV after winning the National Award that the \"moment\" had actually occurred just before filming, during the rehearsal, where actor Om Puri broke down and started weeping openly while reciting this poem; Nihalani reached out a hand to comfort him and then withdrew it feeling that \"his anguish was too monumental for a mere touch to provide any solace\". He subsequently instructed Smita Patil to play the scene like this, giving her his futile gesture. When faced with a moral or existential choice of such magnitude, man is essentially alone and another cannot partake of his anguish or lessen his burden. The movie suggests that Anant refuses to break out of his situation, choosing to stand and face his nothingness \u2013 to continue being an 'impotent' police officer, rather than give up his uniform and regain his manliness and self-efficacy. Things go completely out of control one night soon after as a small-time thief, accused of stealing a small radio, is brought into custody. Anant is very drunk, angry and frustrated. He delivers a shocking and brutal beating to the thief \u2013 while continuing to drink \u2013 accusing him of \"stealing the legitimate Rights of Others\" {trans.: \"Doosron ka haq churata hai, sala!\"}. Not surprisingly, the thief succumbs. The fallout leaves Anant suspended and facing charges of excessive force. Anant tries to invoke Desai again, but Haider Ali backs off, saying the situation has become too hot for most anyone. Haider Ali suggests, somewhat reluctantly, that perhaps the newly elected Rama Shetty can help. After several days of deliberation, Anant decides to visit Rama Shetty in his betting den. Rama Shetty receives Anant cordially, and invites him into his inner sanctum alone \u2013 possibly aware that this righteous cop is finally on his knees before him. He agrees to help him only if Anant, in return, joins forces with him. Anant breaks out of his 'impotent' torpor and, infuriated, in a stunning and violent move, strangles Rama Shetty there and then. The film ends with Anant turning himself in.",

Pooja (Shabana Azmi), who grew up as an orphan girl and always dreamt of owning a house, becomes insecure when she finds out that she and her husband, Inder (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), have to leave the apartment they rent. The twist that occurred when Inder gives her the keys of a new house proves to be double-edged, when it is revealed that he is in love with another woman, Kavita (Smita Patil), with whom he earned the money (in the film industry) for the new apartment. While previously giving advice to her maid (Rohini Hattangadi) cheated by her husband, now Pooja becomes herself involved in a similar situation. When Inder deserts Pooja for Kavita, she chooses to leave the apartment for a women's hostel with only \u20b92000 that she had when she got married. She is helped by Raj (Raj Kiran) to surpass the difficulties of life as a single person, to find a job and to rely morally on herself. Raj and Pooja become good friends. Gradually, Kavita's mental instability deepens her fears of insecurity, even after Inder requests Pooja to sign the divorce papers. Raj falls in love with Pooja and proposes to her. She refuses saying she is empty and cannot give him anything. Raj tries to persuade her saying that she cannot spend the rest of her life feeling miserable about the past and that she should try to find a new life for herself. Pooja promises to think about it. Pooja's maid, whose only aim in life is to secure a good education for her daughter, has saved \u20b91000 towards her admission fees. She finds out that her drunk husband has stolen the money. Furious, she searches for him to find him in the arms of his lover after spending all the money. She kills him and goes to the police station and confesses her crime.

After the insistence of Kavita's mother (Dina Pathak) and her personal doctor (Om Shivpuri), Pooja personally assures Kavita that she is not interested in Inder any more. However, Pooja's attitude only convinces Kavita that breaking Pooja's marriage was a mistake. To escape from her feeling of guilt and insecurity, she breaks-up with Inder. The latter tries to revive his relation with Pooja, but is rejected. Pooja continues to live with her maid's daughter and refuses to marry Raj saying that she has found a new meaning to life in being independent and being a mother to the child and marrying Raj will only weaken her.

        "full_text": " Asli-Naqli (English: Real And Fake) is a 1962 Hindi film produced by L.B Lachman and L.B Thakur. The film is directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and stars Dev Anand, Sadhana Shivdasani, Leela Chitnis, Anwar Hussain, Sandhya Roy and Keshto Mukherjee. The film's music is by Shankar Jaikishan and lyrics by Hasrat Jaipuri. The film became a box office hit.   Anand (Dev Anand) is a spoiled grandson of a rich businessman Rai Bahadur (played by Nazir Hussain). His grandfather wants him to marry Rekha (Sandhya Roy), only daughter and heiress of a rich man despite of Anand's disinterest for her. In the ensuring fight, Anand leaves his house to prove his worthiness and ends up in the streets of Bombay (present day Mumbai). There one person meets Anand and takes Anand to his house in poor neighborhood. Anand settles himself there temporarily and tries to find work. He meets a beautiful, educated young woman Renu (Sadhana Shivdasani) and gets impressed with her. She helps him to find a job but he soon loses it due to his incompetency. Renu works in a small company but tells her mother (Leela Chitnis) that she is attending college. She lies to her mother that her father is sending them money. When Anand asks she explains that she is hiding the fact that her father is dead as her mother can't tolerate that news. Anand further impresses with her and asks Renu to marry him and she happily agrees. But Rai Bahadur comes to know about Anand's whereabouts and meets him. He demands that Anand should forget Renu and marry Rekha for which Anand disagrees. Rai Bahadur blackmails Renu that he would tell her mother about his father's death if she wouldn't marry different person. Having no other way she agrees and tells Anand to forget her. Renu's mother overhears this conversation and understands that her husband is no more. She accepts her fate and tells Renu that she should marry according to her own wishes. Renu and Anand marry and at the end Rai Bahadur accepts Renu and transfer all his property to her name. Hrishikesh Mukherjee as a director comes to maturity in this film and develops a signature style of healthy family entertainment. This film follows one of his earlier successes, Anari. Innovative Song Picturisation: In the expression of love, while filming the song, \"Ek but banaunga,\" Hrishikesh Mukherjee took care so that Dev Anand and Sadhana maintained a distance of at least 20 feet between them. At one time when they come nearer, there is a blackboard on stand between them. When Dev Anand turns around the blackboard to Sadhana's side, the latter puts a slate between them. In the backdrop of rains outside, with Mohammed Rafi's magic all around, someone takes away a goat from the rain-sheltered veranda and one is transported to the dream world of love. At times Dev Anand is outside in the veranda with the bamboo mesh of a window between them. Dev is worshipping Sadhana with folded hands and in the end Sadhana comes near with her hands raised in blessing. Similarly while picturising the song, \"Tera mera pyaar amar,\" Hrishikesh Mukherjee demonstrates the love between Dev Anand and Sadhana by putting them in different places as the song unfolds. In the early part of his career, Hrishikesh Mukherjee was a cinematographer and all through the film, there is brilliant camera work. Highlights: There is a scene in which Nazir Hussain praises the workmanship of an artifact to Dev Anand when the latter is disturbed. The same scene would be repeated by Hrishikesh Mukherjee in the film Namak Haram (1973) between Om Shivpuri and Amitabh Bachchan. In this film, in a lone scene, Motilal, the character actor gives a brilliant performance by advising Dev Anand to let things go, rather than to control them. He asks Dev Anand in the club to hold sands in his palm and tells him, \"If you would try to hold on to the sands, these would escape through your fingers. But if you keep your palm open, they would stay undisturbed.\" The film is refreshing with brilliant acting by all the cast and is very competently directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee. This film's story is partly inspired by The Definite Object, a 1917 romance novel by the British writer Jeffery Farnol.",

        "full_text": " Avtaar is a 1983 film starring Rajesh Khanna and Shabana Azmi. It was directed by Mohan Kumar, and the music was by Laxmikant Pyarelal. Rajesh Khanna did achieve success from Amardeep and Prem Bandhan onwards, but this was Rajesh Khanna's biggest hit film in terms of box office collections after his bad phase from 1976 to 1978. Avtaar was a commercial hit, and was critically acclaimed. It also earned several Filmfare nominations. However Rajesh Khanna missed the Best Actor award to Naseeruddin Shah for Masoom. In 1986 Mohan Kumar made Amrit with Rajesh Khanna in the lead as an old man but with different story line. Rajesh Khanna bagged All-India Critics Association (AICA) Best Actor Award for his performance in this film for the year 1983. The film was later remade into the Telugu film O Thandri Teerpu (1985) starring Murali Mohan and Jayasudha, in Kannada as Kaliyuga starring Rajesh and Aarthi, in Malayalam as Jeevitham starring Madhu and in Tamil as Vaazhkai with Sivaji Ganesan. Baghban in 2003 starring Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini was partially inspired from this film.   The film starts with a mourning being held at Avtaar Industries. Radha Kishen (Shabana Azmi) garlands her husband Avtaar Kishen's (Rajesh Khanna) bust. The story starts from a flashback. Radha is the only daughter of Seth Jugal Kishore (Madan Puri). Radha is in love with Avtaar, a poor boy. Jugal Kishore resents Radha's love. Hence, the duo elope and get married. Avtaar and Radha face various hardships in life, but ultimately succeed. After 3 decades, Avtaar is owner of a small house and fortune. He has two sons, Chander (Gulshan Grover) and Ramesh (Shashi Puri). Chander is married to Renu (Rajni Sharma), while Ramesh is married to Sudha (Priti Sapru). Avtaar also has a servant named Sewak (Sachin). Like Avtaar, his sons have also married rich girls, daughters of Seth Laxmi Narayan (Pinchoo Kapoor). But, they are totally henpecked. When Avtaar discovers this, he leaves his home. Radha and Sewak also follow him. With help of a moneylender Bawaji (Sujit Kumar), Avtaar starts his own garage. Avtaar faces an uphill task, since he has no money to buy equipment, is aged and his right hand is paralysed in a freak accident. Sewak helps his master by illegally donating blood to arrange for money, but when Avtaar thinks that Sewak resorted to robbery, Bawaji tells the truth. Moved, Radha and Avtaar regard him as their own son. Meanwhile, both Ramesh and Chander are enjoying their own life. Avtaar's luck changes again when the engine he is working on gives a successful result. Soon, Avtaar starts manufacturing the engine parts. This gives way to an industrial empire headed by Avtaar, Radha and Sewak. To help other old people like him who were spurned by their own families, Avtaar starts some social institutions. Avtaar's success takes a toll on Laxmi Narayan's business and he holds Chander responsible. Meanwhile, Ramesh commits fraud with the bank and is arrested. Shobha come to Avtaar for help, but he rebukes her and sends her away. Radha gets angry over this, but keeps silent. Avtaar secretly gives Bawaji the bail money on the condition that he tells no one the truth. Bawaji bails both Ramesh. Meanwhile, holding Chandar responsible for the loss in business, Laxmi Narayan throws him out of the house. Ramesh, Chandar and Sudha go to Radha for help. Although Avtaar is not willing to help them. Next day, Avtaar goes to office and does not return. Radha calls him many times and finally reaches office late night. She tries to convince him that she is a mother too. But he doesn't listen to all that. Deep in emotions, Radha accuses him of having turned heartless. Same day, Bawaji meets Radha, whereupon Radha tells him the whole story. Bawaji has to tell the truth to her as he cannot bear Avtaar being insulted despite his big heart. On learning the truth, Radha realizes her mistake and tries to call Avtaar. Sewak informs her that Avtaar had a heart attack. Everybody goes to Hospital, where Avtaar had already written his will and hands it to Radha and dies. The story comes to the present, where Radha garlands Avtaar's bust and the film ends.",

Singh. Kapoor's youngest real-life brother Shashi Kapoor plays the younger version of his character and Prithiviraj's father Dewan Bashwanath Kapoor also played a cameo role in his only film appearance. The film's music is by Shankar Jaikishan. The film centers on the intertwining lives of poor Raj (Kapoor) and privileged Rita (Nargis). In the film, Kapoor's poor, innocent \"little tramp\" character references Charlie Chaplin and was further developed in other Kapoor films such as Shree 420. The film became an overnight sensation in South Asia, and found success abroad in the Soviet Union, East Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. In particular, the song \"Awaara Hoon\" (I am a Vagabond), sung by Mukesh with lyrics by Shailendra, became hugely popular across the Indian subcontinent, as well as in the Soviet Union, China, Turkey, Afghanistan, and Romania. The film was also nominated for the Grand Prize of the Cannes Film Festival in 1953. Owing to its popularity in so many countries, the film is a candidate for most successful film of all time. In 2012, Awaara was included in the 20 new entries to All-Time 100 greatest films by TIME.   Judge Raghunath is a wealthy district judge who convicts Jagga, a man whose father was a criminal, of rape on little evidence. The judge believes that \"good people are born to good people, and criminals are born to criminals.\" Jagga later escapes and kidnaps the judge's wife Leela for revenge. When he finds out that she has just become pregnant, he releases her after four days and plans a different kind of revenge. Leela's reputation is smeared by suspicions that she was unfaithful to her husband and the judge throws her out of the house, rejecting her pleas that the child is his. She has a son, Raj, and they live in poverty as a result of being estranged from the father. As a child, Raj befriends Rita in school, but he is removed from the school rolls while trying to maintain a job as a shoe shine, and Rita moves to another city. One day, Raj meets Jagga, who convinces him to adopt a life of petty crime in order to save his starving mother. Raj grows up into a talented criminal, going in and out of short stays in jail, and working for Jagga's gang, while his mother is under the impression that he is an honest businessman. Raj never forgets Rita, keeping her birthday picture in his home, though he worries that she would dislike him if she knew what kind of man he has grown into. While planning a bank robbery with his friends, Raj realises they need an automobile. He snatches a woman's purse after she steps out of the car, but finds no keys, and pretends to pursue the thief to release suspicion from himself. After his elaborate act, he returns the purse to the woman, who is charmed by his personality and apparent selflessness. Later, when Raj successfully steals a car, he hides from the police in a mansion where he meets the same woman from before. Seeing the same birthday picture, Raj realises that she is his school friend Rita. Rita tries to ask Raj how things have gone since schooldays, but he jokingly hints that he is a thief, and she decides not to ask further. Rita is now a ward of the Judge, who suspects that the new man in her life is no good. As Raj and Rita fall in love, he starts wanting to turn away from crime and worries that Rita will not accept him due to his lifestyle. Rita still tells him that she doesn't care about his past, as she loves him no matter where he comes from. Raj tries to quit his life of crime to work at a factory, but his employers fire him when they find out that he was a thief. Rita invites him to her birthday, to the disapproval of the Judge, who believes that the impoverished Raj must come from a bad family. Remembering the humiliation he felt as a child when he could not afford a gift for Rita's birthday, Raj goes back to Jagga for a money loan. Jagga mocks his attempts to reform and asks him to commit more crimes. Raj refuses, but ends up stealing a necklace from a man on the street, not knowing the man was the Judge. At Rita's birthday, when Raj gives her a necklace without a case and the Judge gives her a case without a necklace (he did not realise it had been stolen until then), she discovers that Raj is indeed a thief. Rita goes to Raj's mother and learns his whole life story. She decides that Raj is not bad, but was forced into committing crimes by bad influence and the desperation of living in poverty. Raj is ashamed, still believing he is no good for her, but she forgives him. Raj goes to the Judge to ask if he can marry Rita, but the Judge is still stubborn and turns him away. Meanwhile, Jagga and the gang commit the bank robbery, but it goes wrong and they have to run from the police. Jagga hides in Raj's house, where Leela recognizes him and he attacks her. Raj enters and fights him off, killing Jagga in self-defense. Raj goes on trial for Jagga's death, where Judge Raghunath is deciding the verdict. Rita persuades him that Raj acted in self-defense and is innocent. When Leela comes to the courthouse, she sees Raghudath and chases after him, but is struck by car. Rita collects the testimony from Leela in the hospital, and later Raj is allowed to visit her. Leela tells Raj that the Judge is his father and asks her son to forgive him. But Raj becomes angrier at the Judge for making him and his mother suffer. He escapes from jail and tries to kill the Judge for revenge, but is stopped by Rita. Due to these actions, Raj is brought to another court, and is defended by Rita, who reveals the full truth to court. Raj chooses not to defend his actions and says that he is a bad man. He asks the court not to think of him, but the millions of other children who grow up in poverty and end up turning to crime because high society does not care about them. While he awaits his execution, Raj is visited by Judge Raghunath, who finally accepts that Raj is his son and tearfully asks for forgiveness. In the end, Raj is spared execution, but sentenced to 3 years in prison for his crime. He promises that after getting released, he will reform himself for Rita, who promises to wait for him. The music for this film was composed by Shankar Jaikishan while the songs were written by Shailendra and Hasrat Jaipuri. The soundtrack was listed by Planet Bollywood as number 3 on their list of 100 Greatest Bollywood Soundtracks. The film is a collaboration of the famous team of director/producer Kapoor and writer Khwaja Ahmad Abbas. K. A. Abbas originally wanted Mehboob Khan to direct the film but the two disagreed over the casting. Khan wanted Ashok Kumar to play the judge and Dilip Kumar the son. In the event, Abbas withdrew his script from Mehboob Studios and Raj Kapoor decided to direct it. The scene with the song \"Ghar Aaya Mera Pardesi\" is considered the first dream sequence in Indian cinema, with its sea of twirling clouds symbolising the conflicts in the lead character's mind. It was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Grand Prize of the Festival. In 2003, Time magazine included it in a list of \"10 Indian Films to Treasure\". Time magazine also chose Raj Kapoor's performance in Awaara as one of the top ten greatest performances of all time. In 2005, Indiatimes Movies ranked the movie amongst the \"Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films\", writing, \"Whenever Raj Kapoor and Nargis came together on screen, sparks flew. Their chemistry was electrifying and it crackles with raw passion in Raj Kapoor's Awaara. Nargis's wild and carefree sensuality pulsates and Raj Kapoor's scruffy hair-rebellious persona only adds fuel to the fire\". The TIME magazine included the film among the 20 new entries added to All-Time 100 greatest films in 2012. In India, the film grossed a record of over Rs.12\u00a0million. This record was later beaten the next year by Aan. In the Soviet Union, Awaara is estimated to have drawn between 40 and 63 million viewers to cinemas across the nation. It remained the most successful Indian film in the Soviet Union up until films like Bobby, Seeta Aur Geeta and Disco Dancer achieved a similar level of success there. The film was also a success in China, where the song \"Awaara Hoon\" and actor Raj Kapoor became widely known across the nation, much like in the Soviet Union. The film's success in both the Soviet Union and China has been attributed to the socialist themes expressed in the film. The film Awaara and the song \"Awaara Hoon\" are believed to have been Chairman Mao's favourite film and song, respectively. In more recent years, Awaara was referenced in the 2000 Chinese film Platform. Due to the film's remarkable success with Turkish audiences, Awaara was remade in Turkey as Avare (1964) starring the Turkish actor Sadri Al\u0131\u015f\u0131k, along with actress Ajda Pekkan.",

Ramchandra. Hit songs from the movie include 'Aplam Chaplam' sung by Lata and Usha Mangeshkar, and 'Na Bole Na Bole' sung by Lata Mangeshkar. It was the top grossing Hindi film in the year of its release, and one of the biggest Hindi film hit in its decade.   After her widower dad, Kedarnath, passes away, Shobha goes to live with her fathers friend, Charandas and his wife, Shanta, who had their son go missing as a child. Years later Shobha is now matured and Charandas scouts for a suitable groom. A wealthy man, Sunder, would like to marry Shobha but the family detests him. Then one night Shobha is abducted. The Police are informed but their search is in vain. A few days later they get wind that Shobha may be in Sunder's custody, a search does prove to be in vain. Then Shobha returns home and tells them she was rescued by a wealthy man named Azaad, housed in a mansion, looked after very well, and brought back home all in one piece. They subsequently find out that the wealthy man is none other than a notorious bandit named Azaad. They are even more shocked when Shobha informs them that she wants to get married to Azaad. Will Charandas and Shanta permit her to marry a bandit? According to author, musicologist and film critic Rajesh Subramanian reveals that composer Naushad was first offered the film. He refused when producer S. M. Sriramulu Naidu insisted that the songs had to be composed in a week. C Ramchandra was roped and the melodies were composed in a record time. According to a book published by Raju Bharatan, film director Naidu requested Naushad to compose 10 tunes within 30 days for which he would get his \"due payment\". To this the great maestro is reported to have said: \"Naidusaab, yeh koi baniye ki dukaan samjha aapne? Ek gaana nahi milega aapko tees din main\". (Naidusaab, do you think this is a baniya store? You will not get even one song in 30 days.) (source: rediff.com) The music was composed by C. Ramchandra and the songs were written by Rajendra Krishan",

        "full_text": " Baaghi: A Rebel for Love is a Bollywood romantic action drama film, starring Salman Khan, Nagma, and Shakti Kapoor, which was released on 21 December 1990. It was Nagma's first role in Bollywood; as the opening credits note, she was 15 years old when the film was released. The DVD cover has a warning noting that the movie is \"suitable only for persons of 15 years and older,\" presumably because the plot revolves around prostitution. The subtitle \"A Rebel for Love\" does not appear on the DVD box, nor in the Hindi titles or license at the start of the movie. According to BoxOfficeIndia.com, Baaghi is reported to have been Bollywood's seventh highest-grossing film in 1990, despite its release in mid-December holiday. The movie opens with a dedication, which reads: \"In this year of the girl child, we dedicate our film to those women, who have been victimised by lust and greed and are subjected to social rejection and also laud those who strived to uplift them.\" The movie was a hit. The story of Baaghi: A rebel for Love was Salman's idea for which he was given due credit.   The story, based on an idea from Salman Khan, centres on Saajan, the son of a colonel in the Indian army, and Kaajal, a modest girl from \"a respectable family.\" The film opens with Saajan travelling in a bus, when he catches a glimpse of Kaajal on another bus, and they are both smitten. They do not formally meet and, since Saajan is off to start at college, he does not think he will ever see her again. But his new friends at college, Buddha, Tempo and Refill, one night insist on visiting a brothel in a seedier part of Bombay. Saajan only reluctantly agrees, but ultimately refuses to select a prostitute \u2014 until he hears a new girl being beaten by her pimp and decides to protect her. To his surprise, it is Kaajal (called Paro at the brothel), who has been kidnapped by a pimp after she was tricked by a job offer in Bombay. Kaajal, who has only very recently arrived at the brothel and is still a virgin, has adamantly refused to be a prostitute. This is why Jaggu, who runs the brothel, is beating her. When finally alone with Saajan as a paying client (although he does not do anything with her), Kaajal explains to him how she was forced to look for work after her parents' deaths: This ultimately led to her travelling to Bombay and being kidnapped by Dhanraj and forced to work in Jaggu's brothel. Thanks to Leelabai, the madame who helps run the brothel, Saajan is able to spend time with Kaajal, and Kaajal is somehow able to resist becoming a prostitute. Saajan and Kaajal fall in love, and he tries to find a way to get her out of the brothel before Kaajal gives up hope. When Saajan is finally able to introduce Kaajal to his parents, they \u2014 not surprisingly \u2014 reject the idea of his marrying a girl from a brothel, even if she was taken there against her will and is from a respectable family. Since Saajan's father, Col. Sood, was already angry with his son for refusing to follow family tradition to join the Indian army, this is the last straw. Saajan is kicked out of his house. He becomes, in his own words, a rebel, a word which is repeated several times in the movie. Since Kaajal is already rebelling against Jaggu because she believes in love, they are now both \"rebels for love.\" Saajan's college friends help Kaajal escape the brothel and flee to Ooty, near where her grandparents live. But just as they are about to be married with Kaajal's grandparents' consent, if not Saajan's father's, police arrive and take them back to Bombay, where they claim he's wanted for kidnapping \"Paro\". Saajan's father, on hearing of his heroics fighting Dhanraj's men to rescue Kaajal, has a new-found respect for his son, who had previously been a lazy drifter. With the help of Saajan's friends, Col. Sood finds his son outside Jaggu's brothel. There the \"police\" (who are actually working for Dhanraj) have returned Saajan and Kaajal to Dhanraj, who is preparing to punish them for her leaving the brothel. The intervention of Leelabai on Kaajal's behalf leads to yet another fight, with several people switching alliances. The soundtrack has nine songs composed by Anand-Milind with lyrics by Sameer. The music was hugely popular when it released and enjoys the honour of being played on radio stations even today. The most popular song of this film is \"kaisa lagta hai,\" sung by Anuradha Paudwal and Amit Kumar. Abhijeet and Anand-Milind went on to record several songs together since. The songs \"Tapori\" and \"Chandni Raat Hai\" were lifted from Illayaraja's movies, Agni Natchathiram and Pudhu Pudhu Arthangal, respectively. Anand-Milind were nominated at the Filmfare awards for Best Music but lost to Nadeem-Shravan for Aashiqui. A minor controversy arose when singer Amit Kumar was mistakenly nominated for \"Chandini Raat Hai\" at the Filmfare awards ceremony.",

        "full_text": " Baahubali: The Beginning (English: The One With Strong Arms) is a 2015 Indian epic fantasy film directed by S. S. Rajamouli. Produced by Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni, the first of two cinematic parts simultaneously shot in Telugu and Tamil. The film stars Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Tamannaah and Anushka Shetty in lead roles. Sathyaraj, Ramya Krishnan, Nassar, Adivi Sesh, Tanikella Bharani and Sudeep appear in supporting roles. The soundtrack and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani while the cinematography, editing, art direction and visual effects supervision were done by K. K. Senthil Kumar, Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao, Sabu Cyril and V. Srinivas Mohan respectively. The film, which was made on a budget of \u20b9 180 crore (1.8 billion) released worldwide on 10 July 2015 to positive reviews from critics, becoming the highest grossing Indian film within India, the third highest grossing Indian film globally, the first and only South Indian film to gross over \u20b9 650 crore (6.5 billion) worldwide, the first non-Hindi film to gross over \u20b9 100 crore (1 billion) in the dubbed Hindi version, and the highest grossing Telugu film of all time. The international version of the film edited by Vincent Tabaillon was screened at various film festivals, and got nominated for Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film by the American Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films. The Telugu version garnered the Best Feature Film-Golden Lotus Award, and the Best Special Effects at the 63rd National Film Awards.   In the ancient Empire of Mahishmati in south India, Sivagami, the queen mother (Ramya Krishnan), emerges injured from a cave adjoining a big waterfall, carrying a baby. She kills the soldiers pursuing her and sacrifices herself to save the baby by holding the baby up over the surface of the water while she herself drowns. Local tribal communities save the baby and the tribal queen, Sanga (Rohini) adopts him. She also gives him the name 'Shivudu'. Sanga also orders her tribesmen to lock the passage along the waterfalls, so that her son would never leave her. Shivudu (Prabhas) grows up to be a strong young man aspiring to ascend the waterfall and makes many unsuccessful attempts at it. One day, he finds a wooden mask of a girl which falls from the waterfall. Driven to find out the identity of the girl, he climbs the mountain again and succeeds this time. On top of the waterfall, Shivudu discovers that the mask belongs to Avanthika (Tamannaah), a rebellious warrior whose group has indulged in a guerilla warfare against the emperor Bhallala Deva (Rana Daggubati) of the Mahishmati Kingdom. The group intends to rescue their former queen Devasena (Anushka Shetty), who has been chained open in the Palace for the past 25 years. Avanthika is given the opportunity to rescue the queen, in the upcoming festival. Shivudu approaches Avanthika while she is on her journey to Mahishmathi. Although she is stubborn at first, Avanthika falls in love with Shivudu after she finds out that he has climbed the waterfall for her. Shiva pledges to help her in her mission and sneaks into\u00a0Mahishmathi to rescue Devasena. At the same time, the emperor has plundered all the gold of the civilians and has had it made into a single large statue of him. The statue is 100 feet tall, and is to be established in the center of the town in the fest. In the time of the establishment, a mishap occurs, and the statue is about to fall down and crush 100 workers to death, when Shivudu (in disguise) , comes and helps them to safely erect the statue. But one slave sees Shivudu's face, and starts chanting \" Bahubali\", which then echoes through all people, insulting emperor Bhallala's ego. In the evening, Bhallala investigates this amongst his palace guards, while Shivudu reveals himself, and successfully evades the guards to meet Devasena. Shivudu rescues her and flees along with her but is chased down by the king's royal slave Kattappa (Sathyaraj), known for his great warrior abilities. After Shivudu beheads the only son of Bhallala, Prince-Bhadra (Adivi Sesh), Kattappa drops his weapons on realising that Shivudu is Mahendra Baahubali, the son of the late king Amarendra Baahubali (Prabhas) and Devasena. A flashback reveals Amarendra Bahubali's past. Amarendra's father Vikramadev was chosen as king of Mahishmathi much to displeasure of his elder brother Bijjaladev (Nassar) who was infuriated because he felt that he was being discriminated against due to his disability. Vikramadev died leaving Mahishmathi's throne empty, while his queen died after giving birth to Amarendra. Sivagami, Bijjala's wife, took charge of running the kingdom with Kattappa's assistance until a new king is elected, while also taking responsibility of nurturing infant Amarendra, naming him Baahubali and raising him along with her son Bhallala Deva. They are brought up together, trained in all areas including arts, science, disguise, politics and warfare, but both of them have different approaches towards kingship. Amarendra Baahubali (Prabhas) is liberal and kind to everyone but Bhallala Deva (Rana Daggubati) is ruthless and achieves his goals by any means possible; he even plots to kill Bahubali along with his father many times. When the Kalakeyas start a war with the Mahishmathi, Sivagami promises that the new king will be the one who beheads the Kalakeya king, she also declares that weapons must be equally divided between them. But Bijjaladev plots for Bhallala's win by providing superior weapons for him and leaving inferior ones for Bahubali. In the battle, when it seems that Mahishmathi will be defeated, Amarendra inspires his soldiers to fight to the death and they decimate the enemy forces. Despite Bhallala Deva being the one to kill the Kalakeya king (Prabhakar), Sivagami announces Amarendra Bahubali as the new emperor because of his nobility and leadership in the battle. After the flashback, when asked about Amarendra's current whereabouts by Sanga, a tearful Kattappa reveals that he is dead, and the movie ends in a cliffhanger that Kattappa himself is the one responsible for his death. I was about 7 years old when I started reading comics called 'Amar Chitra Katha' that are published in India. They're not about a superhero, but they encompass all the stories of India, the folklore, the mythology, everything. But most of these stories are about Indian historical figures. I was fascinated by the forts, the battles, the kings, I not only used to read those stories but I kept telling those stories to my friends in my own way. Baahubali: The Beginning was produced in Tollywood, the center of Telugu language films in India, which is based in Hyderabad. The film series is touted to be the most expensive in India till date. In February 2011, S. S. Rajamouli announced that Prabhas will star in his upcoming movie. In January 2013, he announced that the working title as Baahubali and the actual film production started at Rock Gardens in Kurnool on 6 July 2013. The waterfall scenes in the film were shot at Athirappilly Falls in Kerala, huge sets for the Mahishmati kingdom were constructed at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad and the snow episodes in the film were shot in Bulgaria. The screen writer, K. V. Vijayendra Prasad who wrote stories for most of Rajamouli's films once again penned the story for Baahubali. The film boasts of one year pre production work where in 15,000 story board sketches for the film were created which is highest for any Indian Film till date. More than 90 percent of the film had visually enhanced shots and according to the producer, more than 600 VFX artists worked for the film from 18 facilities around the world led by Makuta VFX and Firefly in Hyderabad, Prasad Studios in Hyderabad and Chennai, Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad, Tau Films in Malaysia, and Dancing Digital Animation and Macrograph in South Korea. Makuta VFX which had prior experience of working with S.S.Rajamouli was chosen as principal visual effects studio. The cinematography of the movie was done by KK Senthil Kumar for 380 days using Arri Alexa XT camera with Master Prime lens marking Rajamouli's first film using digital camera. Most of the film was shot in ARRIRAW format in 4:3 aspect ratio while ARRIRAW 16.9 was used for slow motion shots at 120 fps. Open Gate format, which can utilise the full 3.4K sensor in the camera to produce frames larger than the standard ARRIRAW format was tapped in to get the maximum image quality in VFX shots. For the first time in Indian movies, 4K movie print was rendered with an aspect ratio of 1:1.88 as compared to Cinemascope at 1:2.35 to get the best cinematic experience in screens that support the 4K projection claimed the Producer. Sabu Cyril, production designer for the film created 10,000 different kinds of weaponry ranging from swords, helmets and armors required for the soldiers. To make the swords light weight Carbon-fibre was used instead of steel, the same material used in manufacture of Helicopter blades claimed the art director. 3D printing technology was used to create the head of 100 foot Bhallala Deva's character in the movie and flexi foam was used to create amours to make them light weight and to have the look of leather. V. Srinivas Mohan was chosen as visual effects supervisor and Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was the Editor. PM Satheesh was the sound designer and Peter Hein was responsible for the action sequences. The costume designers were Rama Rajamouli and Prasanthi Tipirneni. The line producer was M. M. Srivalli. National Award Winner V. Srinivas Mohan was roped in as Visual effects supervisor for Baahubali. The film boasts of 90% CGI work which accounts for 2500 VFX shots. Makuta VFX which is based out of Hyderabad was chosen as principal visual effects studio and was responsible for more than 50% of the computer-generated imagery in the film. The majority of work done by Makuta involved bringing the 1500 foot mystical waterfall to life, creating enormous mountains and huge landscapes including the kingdom of Mahishmati, with its massive temples and courtyards. Creating the mammoth waterfall took nearly 2 years as Makuta has to deal with a lot of complexity in fluid dynamics and simulations. Each frame involving the water fall sequence was treated as creating a new set and employed a different set of methodology claims Makuta. Firefly Creative Studio which is also based out of Hyderabad worked primarily on the avalanche and the war sequences which accounts for nearly 25 minutes of the film. Firefly Creative was also involved in creating underwater VFX shots and in establishing backstories for Kalakeya characters. Tau Films from Malaysia was responsible for creating the CGI bison, while Prasad EFX from Hyderabad was responsible for some shots in pre and post battle episodes involving digital multiplication. Prasad was also responsible for creating a 3D image of Kattapa and mapping his head on to a duplicate actor in one of the scenes. Srushti VFX from Hyderabad was involved in digitally creating some of the shots in the war sequence along with Firefly studios. Annapurna Studios from Hyderabad was chosen as digital intermediate partner for the film which is responsible for generating the digital feed with the best color and audio for editing. For the first time in Indian movies, Academy Color Encoding System workflows were implemented along with Infinitely Scalable Information Storage keeping in mind the mammoth scale of digitally enhanced shots in the film. Arka Media Works, production company of Baahubali, teamed up with AMD to utilise the state of the art FirePro GPUs W9100 and W8100 during the post production of the film which are capable of rendering 4K content in real time and are considered the best in Industry to date. Reacting to media reports on the same VFX team for Baahubali and Jurassic World, producer Shobu Yarlagadda denied outright any such collaboration, calling such claims an internet rumor. In an interview with Quartz, the co-founder of Makuta VFX stated, \"Most of Baahubali was developed in Hyderabad, home to Tollywood, and used local talent. It was principally a homegrown feature produced by homegrown talent.\" The fictional language Kilikili (also referred to as Kiliki) used as the language of the Kalakeyas - a ferocious warrior tribe, was created by Madhan Karky for the film. It is said to be the first fictitious language to be created for an Indian film character.  While Karky was pursuing PhD in Australia, he took up a part-time job of teaching and baby-sitting children. During one such interaction, he thought it would be fun to create a new language that could be easily grasped. Basic words were first made up and opposites were represented by word reversals - me was min and you was nim. The language which introduced 100 new words was called \"Click\" to highlight its simplicity. This formed the foundation for Kiliki. Rajamouli's cousin M. M. Keeravani composed the music for this film and the sound supervision is done by Kalyan Koduri. The film released on 10 July 2015 in 4,000 screens worldwide in Telugu, Tamil, Hindi and Malayalam languages. A record number of 1600 screens in Telugu, 1500 screens in Hindi, 350 in Tamil and 225 screens in Malayalam were booked for the release. The film was released in USA a day earlier by BlueSky Cinemas in 135 screens. A premier show was also held on 9 July at Prasads IMAX Hyderabad. The film's release in Kerala was hindered amidst a close down by a section of theatres over the piracy issue of Malayalm film Premam  and released only in few theatres. The Telugu version of the film was presented by K. Raghavendra Rao, Tamil version by K.E. Gnanavel Raja, Sri Thenandal Films and UV Creations , Karan Johar presented the Hindi version and Global United Media presented the Malayalam theatrical version. International version of the film which is 20 mins shorter than the original one, done by Vincent Tabaillon was screened at Busan International Film Festival\u00a0.

BlueSky Cinemas, Inc. acquired the theatrical screening and distribution rights in United States and Canada. Critics praised the film for its direction, technical values, and the actors' performances. Lisa Tsering based on The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"The story has been told many times before\u00a0\u2014 a child is born destined for greatness and as a man vanquishes the forces of evil\u00a0\u2014 but in the confident hands of accomplished South Indian director S.S. Rajamouli the tale gets potent new life in Baahubali: The Beginning.\" Allan Hunter, writing for Screen Daily noted that \"The broad brushstrokes storytelling and the director's over-fondness for slow-motion sequences are among the film's failings but this is still a rousing film, easily accessible epic. There's rarely a dull moment in Baahubali: The Beginning, part one of a gung-ho, crowd-pleasing Telugu-language epic that has been shattering box-office records throughout India.\" Mike McCahill of The Guardian rated the film four stars out of five, praising the film, \"Rajamouli defers on the latter for now, but his skilful choreography of these elements shucks off any cynicism one might carry into Screen 1: wide-eyed and wondrous, his film could be a blockbuster reboot, or the first blockbuster ever made, a reinvigoration of archetypes that is always entertaining, and often thrilling, to behold.\" Suprateek Chatterjee of The Huffington Post wrote, \"However, all said and done, Baahubali: The Beginning is a remarkable achievement. What Rajamouli has pulled off here, despite its flaws, is nothing short of a miracle, especially when you take into account India's notoriously risk-averse filmmaking environment and when the film ends on a tantalising cliffhanger (paving the way for Baahubali: The Conclusion, due to release next year), one can't help but applaud his singularly brave vision. As the clich\u00e9 goes, a journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step, but it doesn't really matter if that first step is shaky as long as it lands firmly and confidently.\" Deepanjana Pal of Firstpost wrote, \"This battle is Rajamouli's tour de force. It's elaborate, well-choreographed and has some breathtaking moments. Prabhas and Dagubatti are both in their elements as the warriors who approach warfare in two distinctive styles. The outcome of the battle is no surprise, but there are enough clever tactics and twists to keep the audience hooked. The biggest surprise, however, lies in the film's final shot, which gives you a glimpse into the sequel that will come out next year. And it's good enough to make you wish 2016 was here already.\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV India rated the film with three stars out of five and stated, \"The spectacular universe that the film conjures up is filled with magic, but the larger-than-life characters that populate its extraordinary expanse do not belong to any known mythic landscape. To that extent, Baahubali, driven by the titular superhero who pulls off mind-boggling feats both in love and in war, throws up many a surprise that isn't altogether meaningless.\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express praised the film: \"Right from its opening frames, 'Baahubali' holds out many promises: of adventure and romance, love and betrayal, valour and weakness. And it delivers magnificently on each of them. This is full-tilt ,fully-assured filmmaking of a very high order. 'Baahubali' is simply spectacular.\" IN her review for The Hindu, Sangeetha Devi Dundoo wrote, \"The war formations that form a chunk of the latter portions of the film are the best we've seen in Indian cinema so far. These portions are spectacular and show the technical finesse of the cinematographer (K.K. Senthil Kumar) and the visual effects teams. The waterfall, the mystical forests and water bodies above the cliffs and the lead pair escaping an avalanche all add to the spectacle. Give into its magic, without drawing comparisons to Hollywood flicks.\" Sukanya Varma of Rediff gave the film four out of five stars, calling it 'mega, ingenious and envelope pushing!'. Critic Archita Kashyap based at Koimoi also gave the same ratings, \"Be it the war sequences, or sword fighting; or a visual spectacle, or pure entertainment it is worth a watch. Kudos to the dedication of S S Rajamouli and his leading men, Prabhas & Rana, for spending years putting this film together. Actually, in its imagination & Indianness, Baahubali might just be a whole new start.\" Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave the film four stars (out of 5) and summarised, \"Baahubali is truly an epic experience. Had the story not been so jaded, this would've gone into the history books as an all-time classic. But that's not the case. It has its set of storytelling flaws, but even those are overshadowed by Rajamouli's ideas and execution. This is definitely worthy of being India's most expensive film. It's a definite movie watching experience.\" Suparna Sharma of Deccan Chronicle praised the second half of the film, writing, \"Rajamouli has reserved all the grander and grandstanding for later, after interval. That's when the film stands up and begins to strut like an epic.\" Suhani Singh of India Today pointed out that the film is best enjoyed keeping logic at bay. She added, \"SS Rajamouli and his team put up a fascinating wild, wild east adventure. It takes pluck to conceive a world like the one seen in Baahubali and to pull it off on a level which is on par with the international standards. The almost 45-minute-long battle sequence at the end is not just one of the biggest climaxes, but also the action spectacle rarely seen in Indian cinema. And if Rajamouli can present another one like that in part 2, then he is on course to register his name in cinema's history books.

Directed by David Dhawan, the mahurat shot of the film was done on 22 December 1996 by Shweta Bachchan. It was released on 16 October 1998 along with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Bade Miyan Chote Miyan was the first box office hit of Amitabh Bachchan since his comeback after a few years of hiatus from Bollywood. The film was the second highest grosser of the year after Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.   A woman Neha (Ramya Krishnan) witnesses the murder of a friend of her named Madhu (Divya Dutta) by a notorious smuggler Zorawar (Paresh Rawal) but she skips while being chased by Zorawar's goons and ends up in the secure custody of police inspector Arjun Singh (Amitabh Bachchan), a friend of police inspector Pyare Mohan (Govinda). In reality, Neha, unaware of their identities, believes Arjun to be \"Pyare\", about whom she was agreeably apprised of by Madhu, and so, Arjun has to impersonate Pyare, giving rise to hilarious situations. Concurrently, Pyare flirts with Seema (Raveena Tandon) - Arjun's sister. Everything could have been passable for the two cops if two lookalikes of the cops, by the nicknames \"Bade Miyan\" (Amitabh Bachchan) and \"Chote Miyan\" (Govinda) had not been a cause of concern for them because of the misdeeds they commit leading to Arjun and Pyare being accused as the miscreants everytime. With background scores of the songs (specially \"Bade Miyan Toh Bade Miyan\") that stir the listeners, the movie advances through scenes of thrill and amusement. This movie is inspired from the 1995 action-comedy Hollywood film Bad Boys' directed by Michael Bay Two friends, Arjun Singh (Amitabh Bachchan) and Pyare Mohan (Govinda), are Police inspector. Arjun's sister Seema (Raveena Tandon) is in love with Pyare. Arjun has no female companion and some petty comments are made about his age. The Zorawar (Paresh Rawal) runs a business smuggling arms and diamonds, under a cover of being a statue maker. Once, in a hotel, he discovers that he is being spied upon and along with the cop spying on him, he gets rid of an eyewitness, played by Divya Dutta. Neha (Ramya Krishnan), a friend of the eyewitness, witness her friend murder. Scared, and with the gangsters after her, she calls the police station and asks for Pyare, but since he is not there, Arjun is asked to go to her, and masquerade as Pyare, who had been described as a very good person to Neha by her dead friend. In a considerable amount of confusion, he takes her to Pyare's house and even ges to the extent of asking Pyare to masquerade as Arjun Singh. Two petty thief, Bade Miyan and Chote Miyan, a look-alike of Arjun and Pyare arrive in town. Confusion ensue when every crime the crooks commit are blamed on the two inspectors. Things goes further downhill when Shyamlal (Anupam Kher), the police commissioner, is also thrashed by the doubles. Arjun and Pyare are blamed for stealing a diamond from a bank and messing up security operation of Madhuri Dixit (herself). Even Seema and Neha mistake Bade and Chote for Arjun and Pyare. Arjun and Pyare further land in trouble when Zorawar kidnaps Seema and asks for the diamond and Neha in return. Arjun and Pyare, who have been arrested, are saved by the arrival of Bade Miyan and Chote Miyan, who confuse their acts of theft and conning, and promise to get Neha and Seema back.

Aman Verma, Samir Soni, Saahil Chadha and Nasir Kazi portray Bachchan and Malini's four sons. Mahima Chaudhry, Paresh Rawal, Rimi Sen and Lilette Dubey are featured in supporting roles. It is an unofficial adaptation of the 1954 Marathi movie Oon Paus by Raja Paranjape which itself was inspired by the 1937 movie Make Way for Tomorrow . Oon Paoos had earlier inspired 1958 Kannada film School Master & 1990 Tamil film Varavu Nalla Uravu and also partially inspired the 1983 movie Avtaar. It explores themes that are prevalent in the play King Lear by Shakespeare, where the lead character suffers much pain and duress at the hands of his children. It released to cinemas on 3 October 2003. This film was remade in Kannada as Ee Bandhana in 2007 starring Vishnuvardhan and Jaya Pradha in the leads.   The movie tells the story of Raj Malhotra (Amitabh Bachchan), his wife Pooja (Hema Malini), and their four sons Ajay (Aman Verma), Sanjay (Samir Soni), Rohit (Saahil Chadda), and Karan (Nasir Kazi). The couple have provided their children with everything, often at the cost of Raj's and Pooja's own requirements. The Malhotras have an adopted son Alok (Salman Khan), who is in love with Arpita (Mahima Chaudhry). Alok was an orphan and Raj provided him with money and education, bringing him up as his own son. Now a successful man, Alok worships Raj because of all his help and thinks of him as his father. Raj has a flourishing job. But, once he retires, he is unable to support himself and has to vacate the house he and Pooja have shared for years. They decide to live with their kids to enjoy their love and affection. However, their kids do not want them: They think looking after their parents will be a hassle. The children decide to split the parents up, each parent going to live with one of the sons for the next six months. The children think the parents will refuse the offer and, therefore, they will remain in their home. However, the parents reluctantly accept the offer. The parents endure this separation as well as horrible treatment from their children after all they have sacrificed for them. Their grandson, Rahul, is the only one who gives Raj love and affection. Saddened by the treatment he has received from his children and their families, Raj writes down his feelings about how he fulfilled his children's dreams and, in return, how they treat him, as well as his love for his wife, and how much pain their separation has caused. His writing eventually becomes a novel. To pass time in the lonesome and angry house he temporarily lives in, he makes friends that admire him and regard him more than his sons. Pooja, meanwhile, endures abuse from her son and daughter-in-law, as well as her granddaughter, Payal. Payal, though, realizes her mistake when Pooja saves her from her boyfriend's sexual advances and nurtures Pooja with love. While changing their trains after six months, Raj and Pooja spend some time together in Vijaynagar. There they suddenly meet Alok, who takes them to his home and gives them the importance and care which their real sons did not. Raj finds out that his writing has become a published book named Baghban. This book becomes a big hit, selling the first copies immediately. Raj, as a result, gains the money he needs to support himself and Pooja in their old age. Their sons find out and are irked that they are not receiving any money. They ask their parents for forgiveness to achieve this end. Payal and Rahul, though, realize their true motives and refuse to come with their parents. Raj is honored for his work, and the four sons attend with their wives. When they ask Raj to forgive them, he refuses and instead disowns them. Not even Pooja will forgive her children for the hell they have put them through. Raj stays with Pooja at their old home, near Alok and Arpita, and enjoy the company of Rahul and Payal, who have in turn disowned their parents. According to film expert Rajesh Subramanian B. R. Chopra had planned to make this movie in the mid-eighties with Dilip Kumar and Raakhee in the lead roles. Mohnish Behl was offered Aman Verma's role; he did not accept it because he did not want to be portrayed as the father of a 15-year-old girl. Juhi Chawla was selected for the role of Salman Khan's wife but could not accept because of her pregnancy. Shahrukh Khan was offered the role played by Salman Khan. Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini were paired opposite each other 20 years after Nastik in 1983. Amitabh Bachchan sang three songs himself. Baghban was premiered at the Leeds International Film Festival, England. It was critically acclaimed and went on to become one of Chopra's biggest hits. The film received an award at the EMVIE 2004 for best media innovation, cinema for the in-film placement of the ICICI group done by Group M.

        "full_text": " Baijnath Mishra, better known as Baiju Bawra (\"Baiju the Crazy\"), was a dhrupad musician from medieval India. Nearly all the information on Baiju Bawra comes from legends, and lacks historical authenticity. According to the most popular legends, he lived in the Mughal period during the 15th and 16th centuries. He was one of the court musicians of Raja Mansingh Tomar of Gwalher (now Gwalior).   Some medieval narratives, mentioned in works such as Mirat-i-Sikandari (17th century), describe an incident about a Gujarati singer called Bacchu (also known as Bakshu or Manjhu). According to the narrative, Bacchu was a musician in the court of Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. When the Mughal emperor Humayun attacked Bahadur Shah's contingent in Mandu, Bacchu fell in the hands of a Mughal soldier. He was about to be killed, when he was recognized by a Raja allied with the Mughals. The Raja introduced him to emperor Humayun, who was pleased with his singing and granted his wish to release the Gujarati prisoners. Bacchu remained in service of the emperor for some days, but then ran away to Sultan Bahadur Shah, who had escaped from Mandu to Champaner. Bacchu is identified with Baiju by a section of scholars. Howevers, others believe that Bacchu and Baiju were two distinct persons. According to another legend, mentioned by Susheela Misra in Some immortals of Hindustani music, Baiju Bawra was born as Baijnath Mishra in a poor Brahmin family in Champaner, Gujarat Sultanate. After his father's death, his mother, a devotee of Krishna, went to Vrindavan. There, Baiju met his teacher Swami Haridas, and was trained in a gurukula. He also adopted an orphan named Gopal, and trained him to be a musician. Gradually, Baiju became famous, and was invited to the court of the Raja of Chanderi. In Chanderi, Baiju's adopted son Gopal also became famous. Gopal married his disciple Prabha, and the couple had a daughter named Meera. Around this time, Raja Man Singh invited him to Gwalior, where he reached the height of his fame. The queen of Gwalior, Rani Mriganayani, also became his disciple. Once, while Baiju was away, Gopal left Chanderi permanently, lured by some Kashmiri merchants who wanted him to serve their king. When Baiju returned home, he was shocked to find his entirely family gone. He became a mendicant, and wandered from place to place, looking for his beloved adopted grandchild Meera. People thought of him as an insane person, and thus, he came to be known as \"bawra\". (Alternative legends say that he came to be known as \"Bawra\", because he was obsessed with classical music.) Tansen, another famous disciple of Swami Haridas, had heard Baiju's praise from his teacher. He asked his own patron Raja Ramachandra Baghela of Rewa to organize a musical contest, in hope that Baiju would come to this contest to salvage his reputation. Baiju came to the contest, and performed extraordinary feats such as hypnotizing deer through his rendering of Raag Mrigranjini and melting a stone slab through Raag Malkauns. Tansen recognized him and embraced him. The legends in the books preserved in Jai Vilas Mahal in Gwalior state that Baiju Bawra could light oil lamps by singing Raag Deepak; make it rain by singing the raags Megh, Megh Malhar, or Gaud Malhar; and bloom flowers by singing raga Bahar.[citation needed] Baiju Bawra died in Chanderi after suffering from typhoid on Vasant Panchami day in 1610. A purported samadhi of Baiju Bawra is located in Chanderi. Baiju Bawra, a 1952 Hindi-language movie depicts a completely fictionalized version of Baiju's life. The film was a huge commercial success. In the movie, Tansen is known to be the greatest musician alive. Nobody is allowed to sing in the city unless he or she can sing better than Tansen. Anyone who attempts to sing, without doing it better than Tansen, is executed. Baiju's father dies when Tansen's sentry tries to stop him from singing. Years later, Baiju avenges his father's death by defeating Tansen in a musical duel.",

Tanvi Azmi, Vaibbhav Tatwawdi and Milind Soman appear in supporting roles. Based on the Marathi novel Raau by Nagnath S. Inamdar, the film narrates the story of the Maratha Peshwa Bajirao (1700-1740 AD) and his second wife Mastani. The film was in development for 15 years, with Bhansali wanting to make the film after Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. However, several times, the production was delayed due to the changing cast. Principal photography started in mid 2014 after the casting of principal roles was finalised. The film was released on 18 December 2015 to critical acclaim from critics, who praised the direction, cinematography, production design, costumes, music and performances, particularly of Chopra, and Singh. The film has grossed over \u20b9350 crore (US$54\u00a0million) at the box-office, emerging as a commercial success and one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. The film received several accolades at various award ceremonies across India. At the 63rd National Film Awards, Bajirao Mastani received seven awards, including Best Direction and Best Supporting Actress for Tanvi Azmi . The film is featured among the 2016 Indian Panorama section of the International Film Festival of India. The film received fourteen nominations at the 61st Filmfare Awards, and won nine awards including Best Film, Best Director for Bhansali, Best Actor for Singh, and Best Supporting Actress for Chopra.   In the early 18th century, the court of Maratha King, Chhattrapati Shahu (Mahesh Manjrekar) needs a new Peshwa, the equivalent of a modern-day prime minister. In spite of Shripad Rao's (Aditya Pancholi) self-nomination as the Pant Pratinidhi, Ambaji Pant (Milind Soman) chooses to nominate a young Bajirao (Ranveer Singh). To test his spiritual wisdom and knowledge of weaponry, Shripad challenges Bajirao to split a peacock feather with an arrow. Bajirao succeeds and is given the title of Shrimant Peshwa. Ten years later, his wife Kashibai (Priyanka Chopra) is visited by her widowed friend Bhanu (Snehlata Girish Vasaikar), whose husband was accused of spying and hence was ordered to be executed by Bajirao. She bitterly forebodes that just like she longs for her husband, Kashi, too, will yearn for Bajirao. While traveling to Sironja, an emissary from Bundelkhand infiltrates Bajirao's tent and demands his help in fighting invaders. She reveals herself to be Mastani (Deepika Padukone), the daughter of the Hindu Rajput King, Chhatrasal (Benjamin Gilani) and his Persian Muslim consort, 'Ruhani Bai'. Impressed by her skills as a warrior, Bajirao assists her with his army and defeats the invaders. Chhatrasal is overjoyed and insists that Bajirao spend Holi with them. Mastani and Bajirao develop feelings for each other and he gifts her his dagger, which is a symbol of marriage among the Bundelkhand Rajputs. He soon departs for Pune, where Kashi greets him with a tour of their newly-built Shaniwar Wada and shows him the Aaina Mahal (hall of mirrors) which allows her to see him from her room. Determined to pursue her love, Mastani arrives in Pune but is treated harshly by Bajirao's mother Radhabai (Tanvi Azmi) and accommodated in the palace for courtesans. She tolerates this insult and appears to dance before Bajirao on the occasion of Parava. Radhabai scornfully offers her the occupation of a royal dancer, but refuses to accept her as a daughter-in-law. Mastani travels to the King and expresses her desire to be with Bajirao before leaving to wait for him at a ruin across the river. Bajirao crosses the river in the midst of a storm and chides her persistence, reminding her that he is already married and that his court will never respect her if she is with him. She agrees despite his warning and he declares her as his second wife. Bajirao leaves to confront the Nizam of Deccan (Raza Murad) and although his odds of victory are slim, he returns successful. A pregnant Kashibai witnesses Bajirao embracing Mastani, who is also expecting, in the Aaina Mahal and leaves for her mother's home. She returns months later with her newborn son, who is named Raghunath in joyous celebration. Mastani also gives birth to a son, whom Mastani and Bajirao name Krishna Rao, but when Krishnaji Bhatt, the head Brahmin priest, refuses to conduct the naamkaran (Hindu christening ceremony) and he is deemed illegitimate, Bajirao names him Shamsher Bahadur. A few years later, Kashi and Bajirao's eldest son Balaji Baji Rao (alias Nana Saheb, played by Ayush Tandon) returns from Satara and expresses hatred towards Mastani for disrupting his mother's marriage. Kashibai is informed of a treacherous plan to murder Mastani and her son during a festival by Shiva Bhatt, another Brahmin priest. Kashibai reluctantly relays this news to Bajirao, who rescues both of them from certain death. Following the murder of Shiva Bhatt by Krishnaji Bhatt, Bajirao is enraged. For Mastani's safety and to grant her a royal abode, Bajirao builds Mastani Mahal for her. Bajirao, however, is broken hearted due to the betrayal of Radhabai and Chiman Appa, when Pant informs him that he must defeat Nasir, the vengeful son of the Nizam. Bajirao proclaims that even if he loves Mastani, his life and allegiance is always to his cause, so he decides to enter the battlefield. Here, before leaving for the battlefield, Bajirao meets Kashi, as tradition held the wife sending off the husband into battle, who reveals to him that he has broken her heart and compares their love with that of Krishna and Rukmini. She, heart broken, orders him never to enter her chamber again; which Bajirao accepts teary eyed and leaves. After Bajirao leaves for battle, Radhabai and Nana Saheb imprison Mastani and Shamsher Bahadur. After Bajirao single-handedly defeats Nasir, he receives news of this treachery and collapses from his injuries. At his deathbed, Kashi pleads with Radhabai to release Mastani so that Bajirao can recover, but her attempt is futile as Balaji Baji Rao burns the letter and refuses to release Mastani. Bajirao, delirious due to his sickness, dies from the trauma of his hallucinations, just as Mastani passes away in captivity. The two fated lovers are shown to be united in death. The project spent 12 years in \"development hell\". Sanjay Leela Bhansali wanted to make Bajirao Mastani, after the release of Devdas (2002). Bhansali originally wanted his Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam pair Salman Khan and Aishwarya Rai for the eponymous roles, but could not cast them together after their highly publicised break-up. In mid 2003, Bhansali had cast Khan and Kareena Kapoor as the lead pair with Rani Mukerji playing Baji Rao's first wife Kashibai. However, the idea was scrapped when both Khan and Kapoor signed other films together. Bhansali wanted to be the first director to showcase their pairing. Hence, the film was shelved and Bhansali went on to direct Black (2005), Saawariya (2007), Guzaarish (2010) and Goliyon Ki Raasleela...Ramleela (2013). Over the following ten years, media speculation continued about the production and casting of Bajirao Mastani. Several actors were rumoured to be linked to the project including Ajay Devgn, Shahrukh Khan, Hrithik Roshan, Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone, and Katrina Kaif. In July 2014, it was confirmed that Bhansali had revived the project with Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone (the lead pair of Bhansali's Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela) playing the titular roles and Priyanka Chopra playing Bajirao's first wife, Kashibai. Both Singh and Padukone underwent extensive preparation for their roles. Bhansali had reportedly approached Daksha Sheth to train the pair in Kalaripayattu, an ancient Indian martial art. Sheth also trained Padukone in the dance style of Kathak. Classical Kathak dancer Pandit Birju Maharaj has also choreographed a Kathak song for Padukone. Singh was required to learn Marathi, learn horseback riding, and shave his head for the role. In addition, the role of Bajirao also required Singh to gain weight to build his physique. In preparation for her role of Kashibai, Chopra took a 15-day coaching course and she will also be undergoing language training in a dialect of Marathi spoken during the time of the ascension of the Peshwas. Irrfan Khan played narrator in the film. In September 2014, it was confirmed that Tanvi Azmi was cast for the role of Bajirao's mother. Other actresses reportedly considered for this role were Shabana Azmi, Dimple Kapadia, and Supriya Pathak. Tanvi has gone completely bald for her role. In November 2014, the actresses for the roles of Bajirao's sisters were finalised with Sukhada Khandkekar cast as Anubai and Anuja Gokhale as Bhiubai. Mahesh Manjrekar has been cast to play Maratha Emperor Chhattrapati Shahu in the film. The film's costumes will be designed by Anju Modi. It was announced in January 2015 that actor Vaibhav Tatwawadi was chosen to play Bajirao's younger brother, Chimaji Appa. Principal photography started on 23 September 2014 with Singh and Chopra. Padukone shot for a crucial scene for two days during the end of December 2014 and resumed shooting in March 2015, after completing work for her other projects. Padukone filming included physically tough scenes such as sword fighting while sporting a 20\u00a0kg armour. A major portion of the film will be shot in Mumbai's Film City Studios. For the outdoor sequences, Bhansali has finalised Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Wai of Maharashtra. The Production designers Sujeet Sawant, Sriram Iyengar, Saloni have designed more than 21 sets including Aaina Mahal and Shaniwar wada. Extensive research and designing have been done to construct massive sets. The promo teaser launched recently shows the grandeur and aesthetically stunning visuals of Peshwa Period achieved by the designers. The grand set used in the song \"Deewani Mastani\" was turned into a museum. In August 2015, a special graphic web series titled Blazing Bajirao was launched in which the characters of Peshwa Bajirao, Mastani and Kashibai were represented in an animated format. The producers also planned a video game, Blazing Bajirao - The Game, where players can defeat enemies as Peshwa Bajirao. The film was made on a budget of \u20b9120 crore (US$19\u00a0million). The satellite and music rights of the film were sold for \u20b950 crore (US$7.7\u00a0million) and \u20b970 crore (US$11\u00a0million) respectively. Bajirao Mastani was released on 18 December 2015 in India. The film shared the 5000+ domestic screens with Dilwale in a 40:60 ratio. In the international markets, Bajirao Mastani was released in over 850+ screens with the largest release in China with over 6000 screens later in its run. The descendants of Peshwa and Chhatrasal dynasty protested against the release of film in Pune. This film is also based on the Marathi novel titled Raau, which is a fictional account of the relationship between Bajirao I and his second wife Mastani. The descendants of Bajirao I and Mastani expressed their disapproval of this film, claiming excessive creative liberty by the director, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, causing wrongful portrayal of their ancestors. A petition was filed in Bombay High Court seeking stay on the film but the High Court refused to interfere with its release. The dance sequence in the song \"Pinga\" and the dressing sense of Kashibai and Mastani met criticism from both Kashibai's and Mastani's descendant along with an outcry in social media. Few historians also opined that apart from the inappropriateness of a woman of such stature to dance in public, Kashibai also suffered from a type of arthritis and such dance was not physically possible. Subhash K. Jha gave the film five stars out of five calling it a \"masterpiece\", and compared it favorably with Mughal-e-Azam. Anupama Chopra from Hindustan Times gave four stars out of five, terming it \"soaring, searing and visually sumptuous\", and wrote \"Bajirao Mastani plays out a like an operatic, swooning, feverish love poem.\" She praised the performances by the lead actors and wrote\" Ranveer Singh isn\u2019t instantly convincing but slowly, he makes you believe. It\u2019s a complex role that combines towering strength with aching vulnerability and helplessness. Priyanka Chopra might have fewer scenes but she creates maximum impact. And Deepika Padukone is riveting.\" The Times of India also gave four stars out of five, pointing out its \"outstanding\" cinematography and wrote \"Every visual resembles a grand painting - courts with shadows and chandeliers, courtiers with tilaks and teers, chambers gleaming with mirrors, skies blushing with passion.\" Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama gave four stars out of five, describing it as \"a cinematic gem\" and wrote that \"fascinating characters and inspirational sub-plots [in the film] advances into a stunning culmination.\" He praised the performances, writing \"Ranveer Singh is stupendous and clearly in top form. The effortlessness with which he gets into the skin of the character is noteworthy. Deepika is enchanting as Mastani and displays the strength as an actor in several pertinent episodes. Priyanka Chopra's portrayal of Kashibai deserves brownie points.\" Zee News also gave four stars out of five and noted \"An outright outshining piece of art made unblemished, sprinkled with sincerity and discipline of acting\u2014this love folklore will restore the drama lovers, back in their \u2018expectation\u2019 block.\" Shubha Shetty-Saha of Mid Day gave three and a half out of five stars, and wrote \"Sanjay Leela Bhansali in his characteristic style narrates his version of the story in a Mughal-e-azamesque scale of grandiosity, replete with breathtakingly beautiful sets, elaborate and well thought of costumes and accessories and dreamy cinematography\" which transports the viewers to an \"unique and stunningly beautiful world.\" Ananya Bhattacharya of India Today also rated the film three and a half out of five stars, calling it \"an experience\", and Bhansali \"a master love-storyteller.\" She praised the performance \"Ranveer, Deepika, Priyanka shine [...] while Tanvi Azmi plays the intimidating matriarch with elan.\" However, she thought the editing \"could have been much crisper.\" Koimoi gave three and a half out of five stars praising the Bhansali's direction and score, and wrote \"When it comes to direction. Bajirao Mastani is a sheer cinematic brilliance. Bhansali\u2019s clear vision of making it an epic romance finally sees light of the day after years of waiting. Costumes, sets and Sudeep Chaterjee\u2019s cinematography all confluence into a magnificent presentation.\" She additionally praised the performances, chemistry between the three lead actors calling it \"breathtaking\", and the cinematography. Writing for NDTV, Saibal Chatterjee gave the film three and a half out of five stars, and said \"There isn't a dull moment in this colourful and dramatic film that embraces excess with unabashed abandon.\" Giving a rating of three stars out of five Rajeev Masand described the film as \"artistic but exhausting\" and was critical of the film's length. However, he praised the cinematography, production design and performances, particularly Chopra's. He wrote \"the film benefits from a nice touch of playfulness and humor in Priyanka Chopra\u2019s Kashibai. Chopra brings grace to the character, and practically steals the film\". On the other hand, Namrata Joshi of The Hindu called the film a \u201chistorical leap\u201d, and wrote \"Sanjay Leela Bhansali returns with another visual spectacle that wilfully takes liberties with the past that it depicts. But it does manage to engage even as it exhausts.\" Conversely, Raja Sen of Rediff was unimpressed with the film, rating it two out of five stars. However, he praised performances by Chopra and Singh describing as \"terrific\". He was critical of Padukone's performance writing that \"Padukone look giddily entranced, there are times when she appears completely lost. It doesn't help that she's entirely eaten up by Priyanka Chopra, who, while not in the title, owns Bajirao Mastani.\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express was also disappointed with the film, writing that \"Bajirao Mastani\u2019 had the potential to be a terrific historical. You want to be transported. What it ends up being is a costume drama\u00a0: too many costumes, too much revved-up, empty drama, and too little plot.\" The original score of the film is composed by Sanchit Balhara, while the original songs are composed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali with assistance by Shreyas Puranik and Devrath Nadaar. The Hindi lyrics are penned by Siddharth\u2013Garima, A. M. Turaz and Prashant Ingole. The soundtrack album was released by Eros Music on November 24, 2015.

        "full_text": " Bajrangi Bhaijaan (English translation: Brother Bajrangi) is a 2015 Indian comedy-drama film directed by Kabir Khan. Written by K. V. Vijayendra Prasad, the film was produced by Salman Khan and Rockline Venkatesh. It stars Salman Khan and Harshaali Malhotra, with Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Kareena Kapoor Khan in supporting roles. Khan stars as Bajrangi, an ardent devotee of Hindu deity Hanuman, who embarks on taking a mute six-year-old Pakistani girl (Malhotra), separated in India from her parents, back to her hometown in Pakistan. Made on a budget of \u20b990 crore, the principal photography commenced in November 2014. The cinematography was done by Aseem Mishra and was edited by Rameshwar S. Bhagat. The soundtrack was composed by Pritam, who collaborated with Julius Packiam to score the background music. In October 2015, the film was broadcast on Star Gold and became the most watched Bollywood movie in the history of television. It had 15.5 TRP in its world television premier, beating the previous record held by the film 3 Idiots. The film was nominated for Best Film and Best Actor in the 61st Filmfare Awards, as well as other categories, and bagged the Filmfare Award for Best Story. The film has garnered the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment at the 63rd National Film Awards.   In Sultanpur, a picturesque village in Azad Kashmir, villagers gather to watch a televised cricket match between India and Pakistan. Among them is a pregnant woman (Meher Vij) who, after giving birth, names her daughter Shahida after Shahid Afridi, the player who wins the game for Pakistan. One afternoon, Shahida (Harshaali Malhotra), now six years old, falls off a cliff as she plays, and is saved by an overhanging tree, but was not able to call for help as she was mute. Since Shahida's father, a former Pakistani army man, is unlikely to be granted an Indian visa, her concerned mother takes her to the shrine of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya in Delhi, hoping it will restore Shahida's speech. Returning from Delhi, the train stops for repairs just short of the Wagah crossing and Shahida gets off to save a lamb. The train drives off before Shahida can re-board it. Shahida boards a freight train, and winds up in Kurukshetra, Haryana. There, she meets Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi alias Bajrangi (Salman Khan), a devout Brahmin and an ardent devotee of the Hindu deity Hanuman. He calls Shahida \"Munni\" and tries in vain to find where she lives. In sequences of flashbacks, it is revealed that Bajrangi has been a disappointment to his father, after failing his school exams ten times. When he finally graduates on his eleventh try, his father dies of shock. Bajrangi, looking for a job, he follows the advice of his father and goes to the house of his father's friend and wrestling coach, Dayanand (Sharat Saxena), in Delhi. Having spent time together with his daughter Rasika (Kareena Kapoor Khan), they fall in love with each other and Dayanand promises Rasika's hand in marriage on the condition that Bajrangi get a job and a separate house for himself. In the present, Bajrangi brings Munni to meet Dayanand, who lets Munni stay, believing that with her fair complexion, Munni must be a Brahmin as well. Munni gets accustomed to being part of the household. It is eventually revealed that Munni is a Pakistani Muslim as she performs Salah at a mosque, and cheers for Shahid Afridi and kisses the Pakistani national flag during a televised India-Pakistan cricket match. An enraged Dayanand orders Bajrangi to make arrangements to have her sent to Pakistan through the Pakistani High Commission, where Bajrangi's pleading fails. He is betrayed by a local travel agent who claims to be able to take Munni to Pakistan without a passport but actually takes her to a brothel, causing him to destroy the brothel and beat up several of its occupants. Bajrangi then vows to take Munni to her parents in Pakistan, in person and without a passport and visa. Bajrangi and Munni are able to enter Pakistan. Shortly after their arrival, Bajrangi is arrested under suspicions of being an Indian spy. He escapes with Munni and meets Chand Nawab (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), a journalist who works for a Pakistani television channel. Nawab has closely been following the developments. Moved by the story, Nawab joins Bajrangi to help him find Munni's parents. They are joined by an Islamic religious scholar (Om Puri), who helps them avoid capture by police. He directs the group to Azad Kashmir after Munni recognizes an area similar to her hometown in a photo from a calendar. Nawab documents their journey on video, but his television station channel head (Harssh A. Singh) refuses to air it. Disappointed, he uploads the video to YouTube. While reviewing the footage, Munni recognizes her mother walking by in the background. With a bus driver's assistance, the trio identify Sultanpur as Munni's hometown. They board a bus to Sultanpur, and are stopped by police who are looking for \"the Indian spy\". Devising a plan to divert their attention, Bajrangi gets off the bus and runs toward the jungle in full view. He gets tracked down, beaten, and shot in the arm. Meanwhile, Nawab and Munni reach Sultanpur, where Munni is finally reunited with her mother. The videos uploaded by Nawab go viral throughout India and Pakistan. A compassionate senior officer, Hamid Khan (Rajesh Sharma), realizes that Bajrangi is innocent, and has him released, defying the order to keep him in jail, which he felt would be petty on the part of Pakistan. Responding to a call by Nawab, thousands of Pakistanis and Indians congregate at Narowal Check Post, where Bajrangi is to return to India. As Bajrangi crosses the border, Shahida, who is also in the crowd, runs toward the fence and cries out for him with her now regained speech. Bajrangi and Shahida run towards each other and embrace. The principal photography began on 3 November 2014 in New Delhi, with Salman Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan participating. The second filming schedule took place at the ND Studios, Karjat.

        "full_text": " Bandini (Hindi: \u092c\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0928\u0940, Urdu: \u0628\u0646\u062f\u0650\u0646\u06cc, translation: Imprisoned) is a 1963 Hindi drama film directed and produced by Bimal Roy, the man who directed classics like Do Bigha Zameen and Devdas. Bandini stars Nutan giving one of the finest performances of her career, along with Ashok Kumar and Dharmendra as leads, and explores the human conflicts of love and hate intertwined in the mind of Kalyani (Nutan).The lead female role was offered to one of Roy's favourite actress Vyjayanthimala who earlier worked with Roy in Devdas and Madhumati. However, due to her busy schedule she refused the role which later went to Nutan, who had worked with Roy in Sujata (1959). The movie tells the story of a woman prisoner serving life imprisonment for murder, Kalyani, the all suffering, selfless, sacrificing, and strong yet weak Indian woman. She must make a choice between two very different men, Devendra (Dharmendra), the loving prison doctor, and Bikash (Ashok Kumar), a man from her past. The film is based on a Bengali novel Tamasi by Jarasandha (Charu Chandra Chakrabarti), a former jail superintendent who spent much of his career as a jailor in Northern Bengal, and wrote many fictional versions of his experiences. Bandini was the tenth highest grosser of the year and was declared a 'Semi Hit' at the Indian Box Office, though it received not just critical acclaim but also swept that year's Filmfare Awards, winning six awards in all including the top awards of Best Film and Best Director, as well as Best Actress, and is still considered a landmark movie of the 1960s, especially being last feature film as a director of Bimal Roy, a master of realism.   A female centric movie, one of the rare ones in Indian movies, Bandini revolves around Kalyani or Bandini, literally meaning imprisoned. It is also the only film to have depicted the sacrifice made by ordinary rural women during the Indian independence struggle. This was Bimal Roy's final feature as a director, and regarded by many as his crowning achievement. After casting her, in his previous women-centric film, Sujata (1959), now the key laid in persuading Nutan out of her post-nuptial retirement to play the strictly raised, poetry-loving village girl, Kalyani. Nutan is strongly supported by Ashok Kumar and Dharmendra, just beginning to make an impact in the film industry and directed by award-winning director Bimal Roy, who ventures into the life of a convict and reveals his/her humanity and the circumstances that often force an ordinary person to commit a crime. This deep social concern is however conveyed subtly without being didactic, through the predicament of the main protagonist, Kalyani lodged in the prison through majority of the film and her longing for freedom. The film also highlights the spirit of sacrifice in the youth during the freedom struggle when a youth would even sacrifice his future wife, at his party's command. Despite having a dramatic turn of events throughout the film, the melodrama never overpowers the narrative, the pace remains engrossing yet easy, and cinematography highlights the stillness and vacuum of a prison life. Nutan remains understated through the film, and the director employs irony and symbolism throughout the film to make his statement instead. S D Burman composed the songs for the film, at the height of his musical career and even chose to sing one himself, 'Mere Saajan Hain Uss Paar'. The movie has songs such as \"Mora Gora Ang Lai Le\" by Lata and the haunting and brilliant \"O Jaanewale Ho Sake To Laut Ke Aana\" by Mukesh . The film is brilliantly photographed in Black and white by Kamal Bose with its rich tonal quality and evocative framing, especially in the stark prison scenes, winning him the Filmfare Award for the year. It was noted for its use of black and white film, to bring \"texture and form in simplicity mixed with richness\", especially in the way he captured the prison environment. The film is set in a prison in around 1934 in pre-Independence India, where Kalyani is serving life imprisonment prison for committing a murder, and we learn the circumstances of her crime in flashback as she divulges it to the jailor. The film is set in Bengal in the 1930s, during the British Raj, where Kalyani (Nutan) is the daughter of the postmaster (Raja Paranjpe) of the village, who falls in love with a freedom fighter, Bikash (Ashok Kumar), who later leaves her in the village promising to come back but never does. The society treats them harshly. Broken by her father's misery and that of her own, Kalyani moves to the city, to the singing of the sad song \"O Jaanewale Ho Sake To Laut Ke Aana\". In the city she works as a caretaker of an obnoxious and mentally unstable woman, who turns out to be the wife of Bikash. Kalyani learns that her father came to the city looking for her and died in an accident. That prompts her to poison her lover's wife, identifying her as the cause of her miseries in a moment of insane rage. Director Bimalda captures her emotions as she resolves to commit the crime, with light and darkness falling on her face due to a welder's torch and the thumping of Iron in the background, and the ambient sounds as she inches towards the decision, pumping vigorously into a kerosene stove, without uttering a single word through it all. And subsequently confesses to the crime with equal passion. Back from the flashback in the jail Deven (Dharmendra) the jail doctor falls in love with her. Kalyani is not ready for it and starts to stay away from him. They are always shown with a partition in between after Deven proposes her. Another symbolism used in the movie is the occasional shouting of \"All is well\" by the prison guard when nothing in the movie is; and just as Kalyani is leaving prison for good, she receives yet another ironic message from a jail official, \"Ab ghar grihasthi ki jail mein qaid rahogi!\" Now you will be imprisoned in the jail of household! In the end she finds Bikash at a ship harbour where she finds him in an ill condition. She then decides to take care of Bikash and her love is again reborn. The lines \"Main Bandini Piya ki, Main Sangini Hoon Saajan ki\" in the end score of the movie tells us that Kalyani is imprisoned by her love, thus revealing the title of the film. \"Mere saajan hain us paar\" is sung by the musician S D Burman himself, this climactic song, beautifully expresses Kalyani's dilemma of having to choose between Bikash and Deven. Thus the character of Kalyani gets lifted from that of a woman who is a prisoner of destiny to one who defines her own freedom. The screenplay of the film was written by Nabendu Ghosh, who had previously Bimal Roy films,Devdas (1955), and Sujata (1959). It was based on story Tamasi by Jarasandha, pen name of Charu Chandra Chakraborty, a former jail superintendent who wrote many stories based on his career as a jailor in Northern Bengal, including many fictional versions of his experiences, Louha-Kapat (1953), Tamasha (1958), Nyaydanda (1961), effective creating a new genre in Bengali literature of prison stories. The principal photography of the film, took place at Mohan Studios in Mumbai, with some parts in Naini Central Jail, Yerwada Central Jail and Bhagalpur Central Jail, and the climax scene on banks of Ganges River at Sahibganj, in present Jharkhand. The soundtrack includes the following tracks, composed by S.D. Burman, and with lyrics by Shailendra. The film also mark the debut of Gulzar, who was working as an assistant director on the film as a film lyricist, initially having refused Bimal Roy on the offering saying that he didn't want to become a lyricist, Gulzar relented only after film's music director S.D. Burman convinced him so, and he wrote the song, 'Mora Gora Ang Lai Le' in five days. Rest of lyrics are by Shailendra, who gave classics like, the haunting 'Mere Sajan Hain Us Paar' in the bardic voice of S.D. Burman himself, Mukesh's sad song O Jaanewale Ho Sake, where Burman da uses, Bhatiyali with a variation. Though the movie features excellent songs they all depict the situation like nothing else could, like a prisoner singing an ode to an imprisoned bird, \"O Panchhi Pyare\" sung by Asha Bhosle and Asha Bhosle's touching, 'Ab ke Baras Bhej Bhaiya ko Babul' composed in 'Raga Pilu', excellently uses the folk idiom of a traditional song of a newly married girl longing for her maternal home, (maika), but being sung by a prison inmate of Kalyani, immediately conveys the irony in its placement.",

        "full_text": " Bandit Queen is a 1994 Indian biographical film based on the life of Phoolan Devi as covered in the book India's Bandit Queen: The True Story of Phoolan Devi by the Indian author Mala Sen. It was directed by Shekhar Kapur and starred Seema Biswas as the title character.The music was composed by Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. The film won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi, Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie and Best Direction for that year. The film was premiered in the Directors' Fortnight section of the 1994 Cannes Film Festival, and was screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival. The film was selected as the Indian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 67th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.   The film opens in the summer of 1968 at a small village in Uttar Pradesh. Phoolan is married to a twenty-something fellow called Puttilal (Aditya Shrivastava). Though child marriages are customary during that time, Phoolan's mother Moola (Savitri Raekwar) objects to the timing of the match. Phoolan's aging father Devideen (Ram Charan Nirmalker) conforming to his culture, regrettably disagrees, and Phoolan is sent off with Puttilal. Phoolan is exposed to some sexual and exploitative abuses, including the caste system. (Phoolan's family as well as Puttilal's family belong to the lower ranked Mallah sub caste; the higher ranked Thakur caste takes the lead in social and political situations.) Puttilal is physically and sexually abusive, and Phoolan eventually runs away and returns home. As Phoolan grows older, she faces incidents of (non-consensual) fondling and groping from the Thakur men (whose parents make up the panchayat or village government). At the next town meeting, the panchayat wield their patriarchal authority to banish Phoolan from the village, since she will not consent to the sexual advances of the higher caste males, who treat her like sub-human chattel. Accordingly, Phoolan lives with her cousin Kailash (Saurabh Shukla). En route to another village, she encounters a troop of dakus (bandits) of the Babu Gujjar gang, led by Vikram Mallah Mastana (Nirmal Pandey). Phoolan stays with Kailash for a while, but is eventually compelled to leave. Angry and hopeless, Phoolan goes to the local police to try to have her ban lifted, but she is beaten, molested, and arrested by the police, who rape her while in custody. The Thakurs put up bail and have her released. But, unknown to her, the bail is a bribe (paid, through the police, to Babu Gujjar's gang), and Babu Gujjar arrives to collect his prize. In May 1979, Phoolan is abducted by Babu Gujjar (Anirudh Agarwal). Gujjar is a physically imposing man and a ruthless, predatory mercenary. Although Gujjar's lieutenant Vikram is sympathetic towards Phoolan, Gujjar indiscriminately brutalizes and humiliates her, until one day Vikram catches him raping her (yet again) and shoots him in the head. Vikram takes over the gang, and his empathy for Phoolan eventually grows into a mutually respectful mature adult relationship. Around this time, Phoolan revisits her former husband Puttilal, and with Vikram's help, abducts him and exacts her justice for his rape and abuse, beating him up. She shares her closure with Vikram. All goes well until Thakur Shri Ram (Govind Namdeo) is released from prison. Thakur Shri Ram is the real gang leader (boss of the erstwhile Gujjar). Shri Ram returns to his gang and while Vikram receives him with respect, Shri Ram bristles at Vikram's egalitarian leadership style and covets Phoolan. In August 1980, Shri Ram arranges to have Vikram assassinated, and abducts Phoolan, bringing her to the village of Behmai. Phoolan is repeatedly raped and beaten by Shri Ram and by the rest of the gang members, as punishment for her \"disrespect\" for his previous advances, and for her audacity at being an equal. The stunning and disturbing final humiliation and punishment is that she is stripped, paraded around Behmai, beaten and sent to fetch water from the well (in full view of the village). A severely traumatised Phoolan returns to her cousin Kailash. She recovers gradually, and seeks out Man Singh (Manoj Bajpai), an old friend of Vikram Mallah. Man Singh brings her to another large gang, led by Baba Mustakim (Rajesh Vivek). She relates her history to Baba and asks him for some men and weapons to form a gang. Baba Mustakim agrees, and Man Singh and Phoolan become the leaders for the new gang. Phoolan leads her new gang with courage, generosity, humility and shrewdness. Her stockpile and her legend grows. She becomes known as Phoolan Devi, the bandit queen. In February 1981, Baba Mustakim informs her of a large wedding in Behmai, with Thakur Shri Ram in attendance. As Phoolan departs, Baba Mustakim warns her to remain low key. Phoolan attacks the wedding party and her gang exacts revenge from the entire Thakur clan of Behmai. They round up the men and beat them up. Many of the men are finally shot. This act of vengeance brings her to the attention of the national law enforcement authorities (in New Delhi). The top police officials now begin a massive manhunt for Phoolan, and Thakur Shri Ram relishes the opportunity to come to their aid. The manhunt claims many lives in Phoolan's gang. They are ultimately forced to hide out in the rugged ravines of Chambal without any food or water. Phoolan evaluates her options and decides to surrender. Her terms are to have her remaining mates protected and provided for (the women and children in particular). The film ends with Phoolan's surrender in February 1983. The end credits indicate that all the charges against her were withdrawn (including the charges of murder at Behmai), and that she was released in 1994.",

        "full_text": " Bang Bang! is a 2014 Indian action comedy film directed by Siddharth Anand and produced by Fox Star Studios. The film is an official remake of the Hollywood film Knight and Day and features Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif in the lead roles performed by Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz respectively in the original. The main antagonist of the film is Danny Denzongpa. The film was distributed and marketed by Fox Star Studios in collaboration with Fox International Productions worldwide.   The film opens in UK where Colonel Viren Nanda (Jimmy Shergill) goes to meet a wanted terrorist Omar Zafar (Danny Denzongpa) in his holding cell. As Viren informs Zafar that he will be extradited back to India for his crimes, Zafar's men enter his holding cell, led by Hamid Gul (Jaaved Jaffrey), killing all guards around them, with Zaffar then killing Viren by shooting him and then burning him. As Zaffar escapes in a helicopter waiting on the roof, he puts a $5\u00a0million reward for someone to steal the Koh-i-Noor diamond from the Tower of London, but with one condition \u2013 the thief must be Indian, to hold up a new extradition treaty between India and UK. Soon after, a man named Rajveer Nanda (Hrithik Roshan) steals it, and when Zaffar's men are informed of the theft, they travel to Rajveer for the deal. Although they initially travel with the $5\u00a0million reward, Rajveer informs them that he now wants $20\u00a0million for the deal. Following the disdain of the comment made by Rajveer, a fight breaks out between Rajveer and Zaffar's men after which Rajveer flies away. After Rajveer escapes, a CCTV footage of him is captured, showing that he is in Shimla. Following Rajveer's escape, he sees Harleen (Katrina Kaif) sitting in a restaurant, who is there waiting for her internet date, \"Vickie\", to show up. Rajveer enters the restaurant posing as \"Vickie\" and woos her over. He convinces Harleen to use the bathroom and while she is in there, Rajveer fights the remaining men and leaves the restaurant, much to the dismay of Harleen. As she drives home, Harleen accidentally runs over Rajveer, who asks her to stitch up a gunshot wound sustained during the fight. Rajveer then gives Harleen drugged water, with her complying with what he says about the government officials, informing her about where to find guns underneath car seats and what they will say about him. The next day, the government officials with Zorawar (Pawan Malhotra) visit Harleen at her bank and threaten her to come with them. They tell her that if she does not accompany them, then they will reveal everything to her colleagues. Harleen decides to go with them to the police station. In the car, Zorawar tells her that they are not going to the station but they are taking her to a safe place instead. Harleen remembers about the gun that Rajveer had told her of. She engages the other official in small talk and finds the gun. She threatens both the officers to stop the car and let her go. At the same time, Rajveer appears on a bike and a chase sequence ensues. Both Rajveer and Harleen find a car and escape. When Rajveer goes out to shoot the goons, Harleen escapes and then bumps into her boss, Karan. She tells him about Rajveer and how random people are firing at her. Rajveer follows her. Karan tries to protect Harleen from Rajveer. He annoys Rajveer and gets shot by him in the leg. Harleen is exasperated but leaves with Rajveer again lest he shoots any more people. In the car, Harleen and Rajveer get into an argument. Harleen states that she wants to go home and that she did a huge mistake by trusting him. Rajveer angrily decides to let Harleen go and hands over the car keys to her. He tells her that he has no other motive than protecting her. She feels guilty and decides to stick to him. They begin to drive again in silence. Rajveer checks a location on his phone which Harleen notices. He then tells her that he has not killed an innocent person before this and does not want her to die. He tries to convince her to come with him for dinner. They go to Pizza Hut where Rajveer realises that he has no money to buy food. They get into an argument about it. He teases Harleen about her internet dating and she slaps him. He threatens to shoot the server (Aditya Prakash) and she eventually pays for the pizza. Harleen asks him about the crime that he has committed and Rajveer shows her the Koh-i-Noor much to her surprise. She has a hard time believing that he is indeed a thief. As she comes to know about Rajveer, they realise that they were followed by Zorawar who says he has the restaurant surrounded with his men and will not be afraid to shoot Rajveer if needed to. As the officials convince Harleen to go with them, Rajveer tells Harleen that he cannot let her go with them. He shoots her with a tranquiliser dart and they both jump out of a window and escape. Harleen slips in and out of consciousness as Rajveer continues to take her to safety. She wakes up in a beach shack wearing a bikini top and hot pants. She angrily asks Rajveer as to who changed her clothes and he confesses that he did it. She is irked beyond words. She beats him and bites his hand. Harleen then takes Rajveer's phone to call her grandmother, unbeknownst to her it allows the Government officials to track their position. After a shootout occurs between Rajveer and the Government officials, he escapes with Harleen with a help of a sea bob and a fly board. Harleen wakes up the next morning in Prague. As Rajveer was able to successfully lead the escape of them both, Harleen now entrusts Rajveer, subsequently falling in love with him. When Rajveer goes out of his hotel with Harleen, he sees that they are wanted by Interpol. Some policemen come at the moment and Rajveer and Harleen share a passionate kiss. Rajveer tracks Hamid Gul at a casino. Although he was to go alone, Harleen insists to take her along, to which he agrees. Staging a ploy for Gul's attention, Harleen and Gul meet in the hallway, who tells her that a romantic candlelit champagne drink is waiting for her on the roof of the casino. Following this, Rajveer visits Gul at the top of the casino, a fight ensues regarding the whereabouts of Zaffar and he ultimately kills Gul. In the meantime, Harleen is caught by Zorawar and is taken to the Indian Embassy in Prague, where Zorawar says that Rajveer actually came to Prague to find Gul. Harleen is asked to get the Koh-i-Noor back. That night, the two meet on a bridge, where Harleen says that the trust between them is broken. Rajveer activates the tracking device himself, allowing the officials to surround them. Rajveer gives the Koh-i-Noor to Harleen and jumps from the bridge and is assumed dead. Harleen then returns home and remembers an address that Rajveer had listed on his phone. At the address, Harleen meets Rajveer's father (Kanwaljit Singh) and his mother (Deepti Naval). At the house, Harleen sees photos of Rajveer (Jai) and Viren, who are later revealed to be brothers and Rajveer's mother revealing their back stories. Although it is confirmed that Viren was murdered, Rajveer's father says that he does not believe the story the Army told him, saying that Rajveer had drowned despite being a swimming champion in his youth, he was the only student who was able to cross the lake in only one breath. On her way home, Harleen is kidnapped by Zaffar, who knows that the diamond was a fake. Zorawar is then revealed to be Zaffar's right-hand man, and gives Harleen a truth-revealing drug to reveal the location of the real diamond. Harleen tells that Rajveer would have survived and is coming to kill Zaffar. Rajveer, silently kills every guard posted outside and places time bombs in every corner and enters the room. Zaffar then orders his men to beat Rajveer but before Zaffar is able to kill him Rajveer informs that the Koh-i-Noor was not stolen at all and it was a joint operation between MI6 and the Indian Secret Service to get Zaffar. The time bombs go off and destroys the castle. But Zaffar manages to escape and captures Harleen again,after making Rajveer crash. As they escape with her, Rajveer follows them with a F1 car and catches up to them. Zaffar enters a flight with Harleen. Killing the rest of Zaffar's men including Zorawar, Rajveer shoots at the flight blades evidently grounding the plane. Rajveer soon boards the plane and a final bout takes place between him and Zafar. After throwing him to the flames, Rajveer frees Harleen. When they are escaping from the aircraft, Zaffar emerges from the flames again and shoots Rajveer. Rajveer pushes Harleen out of the aircraft and a second bullet hits him. He then grabs the axe and charges towards Zaffar and kills him. When the aircraft is about to explode, he jumps out. He loses consciousness and is about to drown when Harleen grabs his hand. The authorities air lift an injured and unconscious Rajveer and Harleen. Rajveer then wakes up in hospital, where his boss Narayan (Vikram Gokhale) is sitting across him waiting for him to wake up. He congratulates Rajveer for successfully completing the mission. He rues about the fact that his brother was murdered and that his parents will never get to see him again. Also, he informs Rajveer that Harleen has been sent back to her home and he has to forget about her because she can become a threat to his life and also his weakness. Rajveer is also told that he will be shifted to a safe facility the next day. After the chief leaves, a nurse arrives and gives Rajveer a medicine to drink. As soon as Rajveer gulps down the medicine, he feels giddy and asks the nurse about it. The nurse turns around and removes her mask revealing that she is actually Harleen and the medicine was a sedative meant to knock Rajveer out. A surprised Rajveer tries to say her name but Harleen asks him to keep quiet. Rajveer faints and Harleen escapes from the hospital along with him. He continues to slip in and out of consciousness until the next morning. He wakes up and Harleen tells him that his one-day has arrived. Rajveer realises that she has brought him to his house. He silently thanks her, and they both meet his parents. Earlier reports had suggested that Siddharth Anand, who made Salaam Namaste, Ta Ra Rum Pum, Bachna Ae Haseeno and Anjaana Anjaani in the past, planned to make his next film with Shahid Kapoor, but Shahid wanted to avoid comparisons with Hollywood star Tom Cruise and also had no dates for the film as he had opted Haider already. Soon news that Anand was planning a film with Hrithik Roshan. In September 2012, Hrithik was confirmed to play the lead role, with Katrina Kaif confirmed to play the female lead in the movie. Hrithik started working on the film immediately after wrapping up Krrish 3, and charged a \u20b9300 million (US$4.6\u00a0million) fee for his performance in the film, which until then was the most any actor in Bollywood had charged up front. The movie was soon revealed to be the official Bollywood remake of Knight and Day, starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. In December 2012, it was confirmed that the official remake of Knight and Day would be titled Bang Bang. In March 2013, the movie's Kashmir schedule was cancelled. Shooting for the film began on 1 May 2013, with the film scheduled to release on 1 May 2014. Unique water action sequences were shot in Thailand and Greece. In an interview with Mumbai Mirror, Hrithik spoke about the action sequences in the film stating, \"I have pushed myself to the extreme for this stunt. This sequence called for mental and physical tenacity. The rush that I experienced while training and executing the sequence was out of the world. I was hooked to a sea plane while I did the stunt. I had trained non-stop to even attempt the sequence\". Hrithik refused to use any body double to perform the stunts. Talking about another water action sequences, the film's director Siddharth Raj Anand revealed, \"We can control the action we shoot on land, but while shooting at sea, you're at the mercy of the tide. Three days before the shoot, Hrithik started practicing the stunts for five-six hours daily. It took us eight days to shoot the sequences in water. For another water action sequence, Hrithik trained for four days, before the shooting. He learnt to jetski with a speed boat pulling him along first. Then, an antiquated plane was brought in with an experienced pilot at the controls, so that it could be slowed down and speeded up at will.\" In July 2013, one of the songs of the film, \"Meherbaan\" was shot in the city of Santorini in Greece and choreographed by Ahmed Khan. In Phuket, Hrithik Roshan performed a stunt where he had to use a water jetpack called a Flyboard and go 45 feet high in the sky and then dive down in the water. It was for the first time that something like this was used in Bollywood or Hollywood and Hrithik became the first actor to do a flyboarding stunt in a film. Hrithik was injured during this schedule and subsequently had to undergo a brain surgery for removal of a blood clot from his brain (Subdural haematoma). Also, the Kashmir schedule of the film was delayed because of unrest in the valley. The delays caused the film's release date to be postponed to 2 October 2014. There were reports that the film had overshot its budget to \u20b91.3 billion (US$20\u00a0million) from a planned budget of around 80\u201390 crore. But film's director Siddharth Anand denied such reports, \"It's funny! Yes, Bang Bang! is a big-ticket film but its budget is as per the scale of the film. There's no question of exceeding it.\" The shooting resumed in January 2014, in Shimla, Manali, Mumbai, Abu Dhabi, Delhi and Prague. The shooting schedule in Shimla went on for straight six weeks. The Manali bridge where the majority of scenes were shot, has become a grand tourist attraction and it was renamed as Bang Bang Point. Just before Abu Dhabi segment of film, a song shoot was completed at an open-cafeteria in Film City, Mumbai on 19 April 2014. Shimla was created in Film City, Mumbai to can a song and few action sequence for the film. The film was shot for 20 days in Film City with the lead pair of Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif. After wrapping up the Mumbai schedule, filming team left for Abu Dhabi. The Abu Dhabi schedule of shooting was an intense action-packed schedule. In Abu Dhabi, filming started early May, and took place at various locations in Abu Dhabi including the Corniche, Liwa oasis, Hyatt Capital Gate Hotel, Qasr al Sarab, Emirates Palace and Yas Island. In one of the chase sequences in the film, 120 cars were involved. The film also had used Formula 1 cars. Even after the brain surgery, all the stunts were performed by Hrithik himself. The stunts were designed by Andy Armstrong and shot in Abu Dhabi. The Abu Dhabi segment of shooting was completed on 20 May in collaboration with twofour54. It is the first Bollywood film to be shot and co-produced in Abu Dhabi. Last leg of the film was scheduled in Prague. One of the stunts where Hrithik was on water skies being pulled along by a sky plane was shot in a lake in Prague. Hrithik trained for four days to shoot this scene. Shooting wrapped on 15 July 2014. On the lines of the popular Ice Bucket Challenge \u2013 one of the biggest trends of the year, the dare on social media, Roshan came up with the dare-to-do game to Bollywood co-stars Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Nargis Fakhri, Sonam Kapoor, Ranveer Singh, Farhan Akhtar, Priyanka Chopra, Dino Morea, Uday Chopra and Dabboo Ratnani on Twitter asking them to post videos of themselves doing a particular task and adding the hashtag #bangbangdare to it. Hrithik even dared the smokers asking them not to smoke for 3 days. One of the companies challenged Hrithik himself, and when he was asked to buy bed sheets from their store and if he did, \u20b9500,000 would be donated to city hospitals. He took the dare sportingly. While most stars take to television shows to generate buzz about their films, Hrithik refrained from promoting his movie through reality TV shows. To protect the movie from piracy, makers of film approached the Court of Piracy with the plea that the film should not be viewed on any device or broadcast on any platform through the Internet without their permission and submitted a list of 90 websites. The Court responded positively on that and restrained them all from making the movie available on the Internet. The songs of the film are being composed by Vishal-Shekhar; whilst the background score has been composed by Salim-Sulaiman. The digital album rights of the film were acquired by Zee Music Company. The first look of the song \"Tu Meri\" was revealed on 20 August 2014 featuring Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif. On 21 August 2014 video of the same song was released. The song was written and sung by Vishal Dadlani. Second song of the film \"Meherbaan\" featuring Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif was released on 3 September 2014. This song was written by Anvita Dutt Guptan and sung by Ash King, Shilpa Rao and Shekhar Ravjiani. The teaser of the title song was released on 16 September 2014 featuring Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif. On 17 September 2014 full video of the same song was released. The title track was written by Vishal Dadlani and sung by Benny Dayal and Neeti Mohan. It was choreographed by Bosco-Caesar. The song experience was \"fun\" for Hrithik, who said, \"It's my ode to the inspiration he (Michael Jackson) has been.\" While Katrina described her experience as \"Dancing with Hrithik was the biggest challenge. His flexibility is incredible. It is at a different level altogether. You have to be really good to match up to his energy. He has natural energy when he dances. It comes to him so effortlessly\". All the songs were well received by audience with the positive response. The film released worldwide on 2 October 2014 with early screenings in Dubai on 1 October.[citation needed] Domestically, Bang Bang! received mixed reviews from critics.

        "full_text": " Barfi! is a 2012 Indian comedy-drama film co-produced, written and directed by Anurag Basu. Set in the 1970s, the film depicts the story of Murphy \"Barfi\" Johnson (a mute and deaf Nepali boy from Darjeeling) and his relationships with two women, Shruti and Jhilmil (who is autistic). The film stars Ranbir Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, and Ileana D'Cruz in the lead roles, with Saurabh Shukla, Ashish Vidyarthi, Jisshu Sengupta and Roopa Ganguly in supporting roles. Made on a budget of approximately \u20b930 crore (US$4.6\u00a0million), Barfi! opened worldwide on 14 September 2012. The film was a box office success, becoming one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of 2012 in India and overseas. The film went on to gross \u20b91.75 billion (US$27\u00a0million) worldwide. The film was selected as India's official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film nomination for the 85th Academy Awards. Barfi won several awards and nominations at various award ceremonies across India. At the 58th Filmfare Awards, the film received thirteen nominations including Best Actress for Chopra and won seven (more than any other film) including Best Film, Best Actor for Kapoor and Best Music Director for Pritam.   Murphy \"Barfi\" Johnson (Ranbir Kapoor) is an optimistic, street-wise, charming young man who was born deaf-mute to a Nepali couple in Darjeeling. His mother died when he was a baby and his father raised him alone, while working as a chauffeur. Barfi is known as a troublemaker\u00a0\u2013 he cuts lampposts, plays practical jokes on innocent people, and is chased by Sudhanshu Dutta (Saurabh Shukla), a local police officer. Barfi meets Shruti Ghosh (Ileana D'Cruz), who has just arrived in Darjeeling; she is engaged to Ranjit Sengupta (Jisshu Sengupta), and is due to get married in three months, and Barfi is immediately smitten with Shruti. She also falls in love with Barfi but her mother dissuades her from pursuing him because he could not take care of her with his disabilities and lack of money. Shruti takes her mother's advice, gets married, and moves to Kolkata, breaking all contact with Barfi. Meanwhile, Barfi's father falls ill and Barfi must somehow raise the money for his treatment. After an unsuccessful attempt to rob a local bank, he tries to kidnap Jhilmil Chatterjee (Priyanka Chopra)\u00a0\u2013 Barfi's autistic childhood friend and wealthy heiress of her grandfather's fortune\u00a0\u2013 for a ransom. Upon arriving, Barfi finds she has already been kidnapped. He sees her in a van, sneaks inside and drives Jhilmil away from the ransom delivery. He hides her in his apartment with the police in pursuit. Barfi collects the ransom but finds that his father has died just as he makes the payment. Dejected, Barfi tries to leave Jhilmil at the village of her caretaker, but she refuses to leave him and they soon move to Kolkata, where Barfi assumes responsibility for Jhilmil and takes care of her. Six years later, Barfi and Shruti meet by chance. Shruti is unhappy with her marriage and she and Barfi rekindle their friendship, much to the chagrin of the lovestruck Jhilmil, who then goes missing. Shruti files a missing person report for Jhilmil. The Darjeeling police learn about the report, resume their pursuit of Barfi and arrest him. As he is being interrogated, another ransom demand for Jhilmil is made and she is apparently killed in the process of the exchange, though her body is never found. In order to conclude the case, the police try to frame Barfi for Jhilmil's murder. Policeman Sudhanshu Dutta, who grew fond of Barfi after investigating him for his nuisances, asks Shruti to take him away, offering him a second chance at life. She agrees and hopes that now Jhilmil is gone, she can finally be with Barfi. Barfi is deeply affected by Jhilmil's loss and finds living with Shruti unfulfilling. He finds the location of Jhilmil's childhood home and takes Shruti to look for her. They find that Jhilmil is still alive, and that both kidnappings were fabricated by her father so he could embezzle money from Jhilmil's trust fund. In the second attempt, second time, they faked her death so that she could return to her special-care home, away from her alcoholic mother. Barfi has a happy reunion with Jhilmil and the two are married, while Shruti spends the rest of her days alone, regretting the loss of her chance to be with Barfi. Several years later, Barfi is shown to be gravely ill in a hospital and is close to death. Jhilmil arrives and lies with Barfi in his hospital bed as Shruti narrates that the two died peacefully together, not wanting to leave each other behind in life or death. The film closes showing the happy days of Barfi and Jhilmil as credits roll. I tried to make the story linear. But it wasn't working See, Barfi is a very simple story. If I had kept the narrative linear then I'd have lost my audience. I think if I had removed the non-linear narrative you wouldn't have enjoyed the film. I know Indian viewers gets disturbed by non-linear narrations. I wrote Barfi straight. But it was boring that way. During the production of his previous directorial venture Kites (2010), the director Anurag Basu wrote a two-page short story which was later developed to the script of Barfi!. The film script that Basu wrote alternated between two time periods, and he retained the nonlinear narrative structure. He said that the script required a 30-year time span for the characters' love to grow and thus set the backdrop of the film in the 1970s. In June 2010, Anurag Basu confirmed that his film would feature three lead roles, a deaf and mute man, a mentally challenged girl, and a narrator. With former titles like Khamoshi or Silence, media reports said the story was grim or dark. However, Basu stated that on the contrary, the film was happy. According to Basu, he paid homage to Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin by adding scenes inspired by the era of silent cinema and using physical comedy in the film, involving silent portions. Ranbir Kapoor was the first choice of director Anurag Basu and Katrina Kaif was the first choice for the role of the narrator. In March 2010, The Times of India reported that Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif were signed to play lead roles in the film, then titled Khamoshi and later Silence, which Basu confirmed. Basu wanted to cast a new girl from Kolkata for the autistic character. Basu's wife, Tani suggested Chopra's name for the role. However, Basu feared that audience would see \"the Priyanka Chopra\" and not the character due to Chopra's stardom. Basu explained \"I had the fear that I would see Priyanka Chopra in the character and Jhilmil wouldn\u2019t work. This has happened in many films where known faces have harmed the character.\" Priyanka Chopra was cast to play the part but, the development was not announced as Basu wanted to workshop first and see how it goes. After three days of workshop, Basu was convinced that Chopra could play the autistic part and reflected that he was glad that he chose Chopra for the role. Later, Basu revealed that he did not approach any actress other than Chopra for the autistic part. After Chopra was cast in the film, Kaif left the project for unknown reasons. Media reported that she may have opted out of the film because Chopra had been given a stronger role. Later, media reported that Asin was approached to play the role of the narrator, replacing Kaif. However, Asin was never signed to the project. Media reported that no other actress wanted to sign for the film because according to them, the autistic part was stronger. In July 2010, Mumbai Mirror reported that Chopra was ready to play the role of narrator and leave the autistic role, so that another actress could be cast in the film; Chopra did not want the film to stall. Basu confirmed this development and said, \"It\u2019s true we\u2019ve been unable to cast the other part.\" After facing several casting problems, Basu chose to cast a completely new fresh face to play the second female role. In early December 2010, Ileana D'Cruz from south Indian films, was finalised for the second female lead, featuring as narrator and Kapoor's first love interest in the film. Ranbir Kapoor played the role of a deaf and mute man in the film. According to Kapoor, he took inspiration from screen legends such as the Academy Award winning actor, Roberto Benigni, Charlie Chaplin and his grandfather Raj Kapoor. Due to the protagonist's physical disability, Basu did not want to use any sign-language but, some behavioral patterns in the film. Kapoor described his character as a regular, happy-go-lucky and good hearted guy. Priyanka Chopra played the role of Jhilmil. Basu described Chopra's role as the \"toughest\" in the film. In order to prepare for the role, Chopra visited several mental institutions and spent time with autistic people. She said she had to research a little for the role because in India awareness about autism is very low. Chopra told that she had to let go of every inhibition probably that she had as a Hindi film heroine and play Jhilmil without thinking of it. She explained that she needed two moments to become Jhilmil because she didn't identify with her character due to difference between her thought and behavior. D'cruz, who portrayed the narrator and first love interest of the protagonist said \"Shruti, is such a sensitive role to play as she goes to different phases in the film.\" According to Basu, after Kapoor, Chopra and D'cruz's character Saurabh Shukla's character as Inspector Dutta was the most important. Basu described the role as \"amazing\" character, who makes others cry when he laughs. Principal photography commenced in March 2011. Barfi! was shot between June 2011 and February 2012, mostly in Darjeeling. In March 2011, Basu visited Kolkata to finalize the locations within the city. Filming in Mumbai began on 20 March 2011 and continued until May 2011. In June 2011, the cast and crew shot in Darjeeling. In December 2011, some scenes were filmed on the outskirts of Coimbatore, especially Pollachi and Ooty. The scenes in which Kapoor's character is chased by policemen over the roof tops were shot in Kolkata at the end of January 2012. Shooting was completed by April 2012, except for some scenes featuring Chopra. The producers postponed the release from 13 July to 31 August 2012 as the September 2011 shooting schedule was cancelled and was waiting to be shot. However, Basu began working on Ileana's dubbing portions by end of April 2012, because D'Cruz was unfamiliar with the Hindi language and wanted to learn it whilst filming. Pritam composed the music and background score of the film, and Swanand Kirkire, Ashish Pandit, Neelesh Misra and Sayeed Quadri wrote the lyrics. The soundtrack album has six original songs. The soundtrack was influenced by Brazilian Bossa nova. Priyanka Chopra was supposed to sing a track for the film, but her contract with Universal Music prevented her from taking the offer. The soundtrack album also contains a song titled Fatafati, sung by Pritam, which was not be used in the film, but was released as a promotional single on YouTube on 10 September 2012 with a video containing behind-the-scenes footage. Some additional vocals are sung by Ranbir Kapoor. \"Fatafati\" also has some Bengali lyrics written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. Barfi!'s soundtrack received positive reviews by critics. Hindustan Times rated the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and stated, \"[o]verall, the soundtrack is a joyride sans flaws. Pritam has given many hits, but like his tunes in Life in a... Metro, this one will be remembered for breaking the monotony in his sound. There are no foot-tapping numbers or remixes here, but the simplicity that makes this album a winner.\" Koimoi gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and stated, \"In simple words, Barfi! is excellent music on all counts. Very rarely does one get to hear an album where you can hear a complete soundtrack without skipping tracks; this is one of them. So, just play, enjoy the music and the world of Barfi!\". Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama rated the album 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated \"Barfi!'s soundtrack is quite good and is easily one of the best quality creations by Pritam. He has totally reinvented himself with this album which defies Bollywood norms and boasts of a sound of its own.\" The official trailer of the film was launched on 2 July 2012 featuring all the actors. It included no dialogue, portraying comedy through gestures and actions, and was well received by critics and audiences. Chopra's character was kept under wraps in the trailers as the makers were not willing to reveal much about her character to increase curiosity among the audiences and was only revealed around the release of the film. Shikha Kapur, the executive director (marketing) of UTV explained \"Priyanka plays a very special character in Barfi, so we want to keep her mystery intact. In the first trailer, Barfi\u00a0\u2013 played by Ranbir\u00a0\u2013 will be unveiled. We don\u2019t plan to reveal Priyanka until the film releases.\" UTV Motion Pictures created a YouTube application called The Flavour of Barfi, designed for the marketing the film. The application features Ranbir Kapoor as his character from the movie and allows users to type actions, which Kapoor acts out. The application features two zones: one asks users to change Barfi's mood and the other gives users the chance to watch him flirt. The film was promoted in various cities across India. While promoting the film at the Phoenix Mall, Bangalore, the crowds broke through the barricades. Barfi! was released on 14 September 2012 on 1300 screens in 700 theatres in India. Reliance Home Entertainment released Barfi! on DVD and Blu-Ray in mid-November 2012 across all regions in a one-disc pack complying with the NTSC format. The DVD and the Blu-Ray discs contained bonus content, including Making of the film, \"Fatafati\u00a0\u2013 Behind The Scenes\" and Deleted Scenes. The Video CD version was released at the same time. The exclusive right to broadcast the film was bought by Zee Network and UTV Movies. The deal includes premiere rights of the film along with the several other UTV productions. The rights are for a period of seven-year, consisting the premiere (for both channels) of the film. Zee Network will have selected runs while UTV Movies will have multiple runs rights. The price of the deal was not revealed by the production company. On 12 September 2012, British manufacturer Murphy Radio claimed that its trademark Murphy baby logo from its 1970s print advertisements has been used in Barfi! without permission. Producer Siddharth Roy Kapur said that he had received a legal notice from Murphy but said that there is nothing wrong in the intention, as the brand in question has been shown in a \"very positive light\". After the film's release, several blogs and users of social media websites Twitter, Facebook and YouTube accused the director of plagiarism. Media further alleged that Basu had not tried to credit the original sources. Several videos were uploaded to YouTube showing side-by-side comparisons with Hollywood films like Cops, The Adventurer, City Lights, Singin' in the Rain, Project A, The Notebook and Benny & Joon. They also accused Barfi!'s music director Pritam of copying the background music from the French film Am\u00e9lie. Basu defended the film by saying that he was inspired by these works and that Barfi! contains an original plot, screenplay, characters and situations. He said that he was paying homages to Keaton and Chaplin. Barfi!'s Oscar selection for Best Foreign Language Film was criticised because of plagiarism, but Oscar selection committee chief Manju Borah defended the film by saying, \"Barfi! deserves to be sent outside. The selection was a very open process with three to four rounds of severe discussions and came down to the best film of the final three.\" The film received critical acclaim, with critics praising the performances, the direction, the screenplay, the cinematography, the music and the positive portrayal of physically disabled people. Zee News gave the film 5 out of 5 stars and said, \"[a]ll in all, Anurag Basu\u2019s Barfi! is a perfect sweet treat for his audience. Like it has been discussed, those film makers who have been portraying the handicapped as dull and boring in their films must take a lesson from Barfi!. Madhureeta Mukherjee of The Times of India gave the film a 4/5 rating and said, \"Ranbir, in the most challenging performance of his career leaves us 'dumbstruck'. Without use of conventional crutches of cool-catchphrases, dhamaakedar-dialogbaazi, bare-bodies, and other 'items'; he stuns you in every single frame. For Priyanka, there's only one word\u00a0\u2013 Bravo! In a role where she needs to under-emote, she does so brilliantly (delivering an incredible performance).\" Roshni Devi of Koimoi said, \"Barfi! leaves you with that warm, cuddly, magical feeling with a few tears to match. It\u2019s really worth a watch\" and gave it an overall score of 3.5 stars out of 5. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and said, \"Barfi is akin to a whiff of fresh air. Its foremost triumph is that it leaves you with a powerful emotion: Happiness!\" Indo-Asian News Service gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and said, \"Barfi! comes as close to being a modern masterpiece as cinematically possible. To miss it would be a crime. To embrace it is to serenade the sublime\". Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis rated the film 4 out of 5 and remarked that movie \"engages you at a personal level\", and further added that, \"Barfi cannot be missed. It demands patience, but the payoff is incredible\". Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph said, \"The brilliance of Barfi! is that it\u2019s no story and all storytelling. It\u2019s about a director at the top of his game orchestrating terrific talent into a bravura crescendo. Only someone who has showed death the door can open windows to life like this.\" Filmfare gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and stated, \"Barfi! is that rare film that can make you smile and make you cry in the same scene. Its technical brilliance is only outdone by its emotional complexity and depth. Pritam's music adds a nice silent-era charm to this already fantastic story, making it an occasion when words simply aren\u2019t enough.\" Raja Sen of Rediff.com has given 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \"Barfi! is a well-crafted script with an intriguing back-and-forth narrative but it all goes south towards the end.\" Anupama Chopra writing for Hindustan Times gave it 3 out 5 stars and wrote, \"[t]his is a film made with love, bolstered by wonderfully etched vignettes, Ranbir Kapoor's stupendous performance and a gorgeous soundtrack by Pritam. And yet, for me, Barfi was a singularly frustrating experience there was so much to like, but the film never became more than the sum of its parts\". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 3 out of 5 stars and said, \"Barfi had the potential to be great cinema, but as it stands it's a respectable film that's still better than a lot else you're likely to see.\" On the contrary, Namrata Joshi of Outlook felt that \"The flashback within flashback narrative gets way too clumsy and turgid, the thriller twist absolutely pointless [....] appears much too crafted and self-consciously gorgeous, and feels eminently facile and plastic\". The movie received critical acclaim overseas as well. It holds an 83% fresh rating on review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes. Rachel Saltz of the New York Times said, \"Bollywood isn\u2019t afraid to be mawkish. \u201cBarfi!\u201d is at times, though not noticeably more so than most Hindi movies, despite its premise of special lovers with a special lesson to teach.\" Lisa Tsering The Hollywood Reporter called the movie \"a refreshingly non-commercial exercise\" and added that \"poignant Bollywood romantic comedy\". On the performances of the cast she wrote, \"[...] Basu has guided Kapoor and especially Chopra to turn in exceptionally restrained, organic performances.\"\" Ronnie Scheib of Variety wrote, \"Unlike Michel Hazanavicus\u2019 black-and-white silent homage \u201cThe Artist,\u201d Basu\u2019s film bursts with sound and color; only the speaking- and hearing-impaired Basu is condemned to silence.\" Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times was more critical of the film, despite praising aspect including \"the hard-working cast, a lush score, exotic location shooting and scattered warmth\" called it as \"more endurance test than entertainment.\" Barfi! has received various awards and nominations in categories ranging mostly from recognition of the film itself, to its cinematography, direction, screenplay, and music, to the cast's performance.

The film stars the famous duo of Kapoor and Nargis as well as Prem Nath. It was also the introduction of actress Nimmi in her first film role. Barsaat was one of the first major hit films directed by Kapoor. This success allowed Kapoor to buy RK Studios in 1950.   The film revolves around two love stories. Pran (Raj Kapoor) and Reshma (Nargis) and Gopal (Prem Nath) and Neela (Nimmi). Two friends with opposite personalities, the rich but sensitive Pran and the womanizing Gopal both have affairs with two mountain girls while holidaying in the valley of Kashmir. While Pran and Reshma's love is true and reciprocated, Gopal is a womanizing villain, who disregards the faithful Neela (Nimmi) and condemns her to wait faithfully for his return with the barsaat (rainy season). Many plot intrigues follow through with Pran and Reshma facing many trials on the path to true love, including parental opposition, accidents and an attempted forced marriage of Reshma to an uncouth fisherman. The couple are finally reunited. Gopal on the other hand finally becomes a reformed character and rushes to claim the ever faithful Neela who has been pining away, only to arrive to find his true love dead. The film ends with Gopal lighting Neela's funeral pyre as the rains finally come. The much acclaimed poster and publicity for the movie were illustrated by the master artist Dr S. M. Pandit.

It won five Filmfare Awards. Kapoor and Dixit won the Best Actor and Best Actress awards, respectively. Anuradha Paudwal won the Best Female Playback Singer Award for the item number \"Dhak Dhak Karne Laga,\" while Saroj Khan won the Filmfare Award for Best Choreography and Irani won the Best Supporting Actress award. The film became popular due to many reasons. Initially, actress Sridevi was offered the role of Saraswati. She refused because she had collaborated with Kapoor numerous times before. The item number \"Dhak Dhak Karne Laga\" remains one of the most popular Hindi songs of the 20th-century. Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit became one of the most popular on-screen couples of Bollywood.   Beta is the story of Raju (Anil Kapoor), the only child of a widowed multi-millionaire father who can provide his son with anything he wants except Raju's only desire \u2014 a mother's love. Raju's father believes he can please his son by marrying Laxmi (Aruna Irani), thinking that she will care for Raju as her natural son. Raju becomes devoted to his stepmother, does whatever she asks of him; she convinces Raju that Raju should remain na\u00efve and uneducated otherwise he would work for others rather than be self-employed. Raju grows older his stepmother increasingly isolates his father from the family, is considered mentally incompetent, and locked in a room of the family home. Raju meets Saraswati (Madhuri Dixit) and following her abduction and assaulted at a fair, he rescues her. They fall in love and, despite the villagers believing she is no longer chaste, he marries her. Saraswati discovers that her stepmother-in-law's love for Raju is a rouse to discredit the sanity of Raju's father and unable to interfere with the plan. Laxmi has the family fortune diverted to Raju's stepbrother, the natural result of the marriage between his father and stepmother. He shares the greed for the family fortune. A battle of wills between the stepmother and the stepdaughter-in-law ensues. Laxmi sees that her influence over the family is challenged by Saraswati who insists that Raju's father leave behind his prison and return to the family circle as there is nothing wrong with him. And she makes Raju aware of the intentions of his step-mother. Laxmi starts to abuse and embarrass Saraswati with all the family members present. Saraswati is ready to leave but then, to protect her husband and her house from Laxmi's intentions, she decides to apologise to her mother-in-law. Saraswati then cleverly starts exposing Laxmi's every effort and intention in a dignified manner so that her husband will not be offended. The medical school degree of Raju's step-brother was bought rather than earned through studies and Laxmi is set up to slip on the pavement so that the over-protectiveness that she has instilled in Raju will force her remain in bed as he will serve her without pause; Laxmi never has a moment to herself and her scheming. Saraswati becoming pregnant prompts Laxmi to attempt to kill Raju's wife and unborn child with poison, saffron and milk. Saraswati discovers this and returns to her direct approach by telling Raju. He continues to refuse to believe the treachery although she takes an oath upon her unborn child's life. Raju defends his step-mother and offers to prove that Saraswati is wrong. Raju drinks the milk and then coughs up blood. He comes to the realisation of what Saraswati said was all along his step-mother's intentions. In his usual innocent manner, he asks her why, that all she had to do as his mother was simply ask for the wealth\u2014he would have happily agreed to give her it all. He tells Laxmi that his wish to die in peace would be accomplished if she, to at least once with a clean heart, call him 'her son'. His words so deeply touch Laxmi that she realises her cruelty has been directed at the only son who all along had ever loved her. Raju's step brother physically confronts his mother as he wants to continue with the plan but the dying Raju saves her. The film concludes with Raju recovering, agreeing to give up to his mother his worldly possessions, and leaving home with his wife and father. At the last moment, Laxmi begs him not to leave, claiming to have learned the error of her ways. She tears-up the legal papers and tells him that all she wants is nothing more than 'her son'.

        "full_text": " Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (English: \"Run Milkha Run\") is a 2013 Indian biographical sports drama film directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra from a script written by Prasoon Joshi. The story is based on the life of Milkha Singh, an Indian athlete who was a national champion runner and an Olympian. It stars Farhan Akhtar in the lead role with Pavan Malhotra and Art Malik in supporting roles and Sonam Kapoor in a cameo. Sports was coordinated by the American action director Rob Miller of ReelSports. Made on a budget of \u20b9300 million (US$4.6\u00a0million), the film released on 12 July 2013 and gathered a positive response from critics and audiences alike. It performed very well at the box office, eventually being declared a \"super hit\" domestically and hit overseas. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is the sixth highest grossing 2013 Bollywood film worldwide and became the 21st film to gross \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million). Singh and his daughter, Sonia Sanwalka, co-wrote his autobiography, titled The Race of My Life. The book inspired Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. Singh sold the film rights for one rupee and inserted a clause stating that a share of the profits would be given to the Milkha Singh Charitable Trust. The Trust was founded in 2003 with the aim of assisting poor and needy sportspeople.   The film starts in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, where a coach says \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag!\" The runner is taken back to the memories of his childhood days which haunt him, resulting in him dropping to fourth. Partition of India in 1947 caused chaos which resulted in mass religious violence in Punjab in British India, killing the parents of Milkha Singh (Farhan Akhtar). He reaches Delhi and later meets his sister there. Living in impoverished refugee camps, Milkha makes friends and survives by stealing with them. He falls in love with Biro (Sonam Kapoor), but she asks him to live a life of honesty. Milkha finds himself in the army where he gets noticed by a havaldar (sergeant) after he wins a race in which the top 10 runners will get milk, two eggs and excused from exercise. He gets selected for service commission where he is miffed and gets beaten up by senior players whom he had defeated earlier, on the day before selection of Indian team for Olympics. In spite of being injured, he participates in the race. Overcoming his pain, he wins the race thus breaking the national record. During the Melbourne 1956 Olympics he is attracted to the granddaughter of his Australian technical coach. After a frolicking night in a bar, they have a one-night stand. The following day he feels exhausted from the night's activities and loses the final race. He realizes his mistake. Suffering from guilt, he even slaps himself in front of a mirror. On the flight back to India he asks his coach what the world record is for the 400m race and learns that it is 45.90 seconds. He trains hard and wins in several places. He then breaks the previous world record for the 400m race with a time of 45.80 seconds. Jawaharlal Nehru (Dalip Tahil), the prime minister, convinces him to lead the Indian team in Pakistan for a friendly race with Abdul Khaliq (Dev Gill), also known as the fastest man of Asia. In Pakistan he misses the press conference and goes to his village where, in a flashback, it is shown how his parents were murdered and the last words of his father were \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag!\" He starts crying and is comforted by a boy who turns out to be his childhood friend's son. He also meets his friend Sampreet. In the games, initially the Pakistani favorite is winning, but Milkha takes the lead overtaking opponents one by one, taking a convincing lead, and winning the race and respect of the two nations. The president of Pakistan, General Ayub Khan, impressed by his effort gives him the title \"The Flying Sikh\". Jawaharlal Nehru declares a day in the name of Milkha as national holiday as desired by Milkha himself. After the release of Delhi-6 (2009), director Om Prakash Mehra started developing two projects: a historical love story, Mirza Sahiban, and a biopic of Milkha Singh. The biopic developed better, and he chose the latter. Prasoon Joshi, who co-wrote Delhi-6 with Mehra, started working on the script. Joshi later clarified that the film's title, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (Run Milkha Run) was never actually spoken by Milkha's father. Rather, it was phrase coined by him and was used liberally throughout the narrative. \"This film is not a mirror of Milkha Singh's life. It is an interpretation of his life.\" Growing up in Delhi, Mehra was familiar with anecdotes from the life of Milkha Singh, the ace runner popular as \"Flying Sikh\". He used to visit the National Stadium, Delhi for swimming, where Singh also came for his practice. Gradually, he came to know details regarding his early life, including how he witnessed his entire family being killed during the partition and traveled alone to Delhi as a refugee. Mehra started developing the project as personal story rather than a sports film, taking the theme of \"zindagi se bhago nahin, zindagi ke saath bhago\" (\"don't run away from life, run with life\"), depicting his life from 13 to 28 years. For research, he visited Chandigarh several times, where he talked for hours with Singh. Jeev Milkha Singh, the son of Milkha Singh and a notable golfer, arranged his meetings with the family members. Milkha Singh refused a large offer for allowing his story to be adapted and charged a token amount of \u20b91 (1.5\u00a2\u00a0US), as he believed if the film could \"inspire our young people and result in India's first Olympic track gold, that would [be] reward enough for him.\" It took the next two and half years to write the story. According to the director, it is not a sports film, but a film about human spirit. In 2010, early contenders of the lead role were Abhishek Bachchan and Akshay Kumar. While Bachchan was preferred by Mehra, Kumar was preferred by Milkha Singh. However, Mehra deferred the final decision on the cast till the final script was completed. After months of search, in September 2011, the principal cast were announced. Actor-director Farhan Akhtar and Sonam Kapoor received the lead roles. Thereafter, Akhtar visited Punjab to meet Milkha Singh and his family. Before deciding, Akhtar met Mehra once for a story session and immediately agreed to play the role. He was inspired by Milkha Singh's life and underwent extensive physical training for the role. Pakistani actress and singer, Meesha Shafi \u2014 who got fame after her song \"Alif Allah (Jugni),\" played RAW agent in the hit Pakistani film Waar and in 2013 made her Hollywood debut with The Reluctant Fundamentalist \u2014 was selected for the role of Perizaad (Milkha Singh's best friend). The principal photography commenced in February 2012 and mainly took place in Punjab, India, with some scenes shot in Delhi, Tokyo, Melbourne and Rome. International company ReelSports coordinated the sports action for Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and cast all the elite runners. The music and the background score were composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, their first film collaboration with Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. The soundtrack features seven tracks with lyrics written by Prasoon Joshi. The audio was released by Sony Music on 14 June 2013, on digital platforms including iTunes and Amazon. Farhan Akhtar and director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra launched the movie's official mobile game at the Reliance Digital electronics store in Times Square on 3 August 2013. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag released on 12 July 2013 in 1200 screens worldwide including 140 screens in USA. Maharashtra government and Madhya Pradesh government granted an entertainment tax exemption to Bhaag Milkha Bhaag on 20 July 2013. On 24 July 2013, the Delhi government also announced a tax exemption. On 25 July 2013, Goa's government gave tax-free status to the film for three months. On 29 July 2013, Haryana government made the film tax-free in the state. On 1 August 2013, Uttar Pradesh government approved a proposal to exempt Bhaag Milkha Bhaag from entertainment tax in two installments or for a maximum of two months. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Bollywood Hungama's Taran Adarsh predicted that it would \"win accolades, admiration, respect and esteem, besides emerging as a champ\", while Sneha May Francis of Emirates 24/7 gave a thumbs up, saying that the film is \"truly epic\" and that \"despite the prestigious Olympic glory eluding him, Mehra deservedly honors the runner\u2019s other victories and impeccable talent, allowing us to applaud the prodigy.\" Desimartini, with almost 5000 ratings by the end of the weekend stated the following: \"Superbly directed, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is an outstanding film with an incredible performance by Farhan Akhtar. Though long, it keeps you hooked throughout. Don't miss this patriotic tribute to Milkha Singh.\" Madhureeta Mukherjee of The Times of India stated, \"While you are on-the-run, pause to watch this one.\" The India Today review concluded, \"Go and run with Milkha. In this fast-paced life, this race will definitely soothe your senses.\" Sify's Vijay Sinha praised the film, judging \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag should get even drug-addled Punjab flocking to the cinemas.\" Gayatri Sankar of Zee News wrote, \"If you are a patriotic Indian, you will be left teary eyed and your head held high.\" Yahoo! Movies' review summed up, \"Mehra has helmed 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' into a compelling story and an exemplar of cinematic brilliance; that it is also an inspiring tale almost seems to be a by-product.\" Hrithik Roshan praised Akhtar\u2019s performance and deemed the film to be \"phenomenal\". Veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan highly praised it on his blog, describing it as \"too emotionally and creatively moving to put anything down in words\". Carl Lewis watched Bhaag Milkha Bhaag in the US and called Milkha Singh in India to express his appreciation for the film and the athlete. Aseem Chhabra of Rediff.com gave a mixed review and reasoned that film does not offer anything new. However, he praised Akhtar's performance, writing \"If there is one reason to see BMB it is to watch Akhtar \u2013 how much he has evolved as an actor and the sincerity with which he immerses himself in the character.\" NDTV echoed the same sentiment, \"Bhaag Milkha Singh is a 400 meters sprint that feels like a cross-country race.\" Despite praising the technical aspects and music, Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN criticized the length: \"The film itself is well intentioned and shines a light on an important figure. The film is an ambitious account of the first 27 years or so of celebrated Indian sprinter Milkha Singh's roller-coaster life. But it's too long and too unfocused to leave a lasting impression.\" Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times described the film as \"a stirring bio of Milkha Singh\", while Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times said that \"the movie strikes its chosen couple of notes resoundingly, making clear what makes Singh run.\" Twitch Film's review said, \"[..]in the grand scheme of things. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is easily one of the best mainstream films to come out of Bollywood this year.\" Scott Foundas of Variety described it as a \"rousing and handsomely crafted biopic\". Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter opined that the biopic \"requires viewer endurance, but pays off with an exhilarating climax.\" Digital Spy praised the work and said, \"It is a blessing that this film was made and the inspiring story of India's greatest sporting hero told to a generation who might otherwise never have known the legend of 'The Flying Sikh.'\" The Los Angeles Times stated that there's enough dramatic restraint and performance charm to give Singh his due as a justifiably glorified figure in India's independence. The Washington Post stated that the Bollywood import dramatizes the life of famed Indian sprinter Milkha Singh.

The final overseas business is around US$3.8 million. The film's song \"Maston Ka Jhund\" landed into controversy after a right-wing Hindu organization, Hindu Janajagruti Samiti (HJS), took objection to the use of the word \"havan\" in the song. They alleged that havan (Yagya) has been used in a derogatory manner. Their reference is to the allegedly 'obscene' actions that the actors performed on the song. Demonstrations were held in Goa regarding the issue. Certain members of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) boycotted a workshop held in accordance with Information and Broadcast Ministry's wish citing partially of some officials of the censor board particularly regarding the certificate given to Bhaag Milkha Bhaag which, in spite of a sex scene and some violence, got a U certificate[a] lashing out and criticising the decisions of the censor examining member and former actress, Sharmila Tagore accusing CEO Pankaja Thakur along with some other board officials being puppets controlled by film directors and promoting vulgarity. As a consequence the Delhi High Court sought an explanation from the I&B ministry and the CBFC regarding the escalating levels of vulgarity in recent times. Although the story mentions that Milkha Singh held the men's 400 meter world record, the men's 400 metres world record progression does not mention Milkha Singh's name in the world record holders. It is shown that Ranbir Singh (Milkha Singh's coach) mentions world record as 45.9 seconds after 1952 Olympics; while Milkha eventually bested that time in the 1956 Olympics with a personal record of 45.73 seconds, the newest world record was 45.2 seconds set by Lou Jones of United States, the first-place winner in the same race. Gurbachan Singh Randhawa, renowned athlete, who was part of Indian team at Rome Olympics mentions that the claim made in movie about Milkha Singh leading the 400 meter race and he lost it as he looked behind, is incorrect. He never led the race and he was at fifth position at 300 meters. In the final race when Milkha Singh\u2019s sister tune in the radio to follow the developments in Lahore live, the radio commentator can be heard as announcing, \u201cIt seems that entire Pakistan has settled inside the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.\u201d The Lahore Stadium which was originally built in 1959 wasn\u2019t renamed as Gaddafi Stadium until 1974. The Malaysian flag did not exist until 1957. There a Malaysian flag in a scene during 1956 in Melbourne. Though the movie is set in the 1950s, Farhan Akhtar sings the song \"Nanha munna rahi hoon.\" The song is from the movie Son of India which was released in 1962.",

        "full_text": " Bhumika ('The Role') is a 1977 Indian film directed by Shyam Benegal. The movie stars Smita Patil, Amol Palekar, Anant Nag, Naseeruddin Shah and Amrish Puri. This film is broadly based on the Marathi-language memoirs, Sangtye Aika of the well-known Marathi stage and screen actress of the 1940s 'Hansa Wadkar', who led a flamboyant and unconventional life, and focuses on an individual's search for identity and self-fulfilment. Smita Patil gives a strong performance of transforming from a vivacious teenager to a wiser but deeply wounded middle-aged woman. The film won two National Film Awards and Filmfare Best Movie Award. It was invited to Carthage Film Festival 1978, Chicago Film Festival, where it was awarded the Golden Plaque 1978, and in 1986 it was invited to Festival of Images, Algeria.   Bhumika tells the life story of an actress, Usha (Smita Patil), who is the granddaughter of a famous female singer of the old tradition from Devadasi community of Goa. Usha's mother (Sulabha Deshpande) is married to an abusive and alcoholic Brahmin. Following his early death, and over her mother's objections, Usha is taken to Bombay by family hanger-on Keshav Dalvi (Amol Palekar) to audition successfully as a singer in a Bombay studio: the first step in a process, watched approvingly by Usha's doting grandmother and with horror by her mother, that will eventually carry her to on-camera adolescent stardom, and to an ill-starred love marriage with Keshav. Usha\u2019s motives for stubbornly pursuing this relationship (culminating in a pre-marital pregnancy) with the unattractive and much older Keshav \u2014 who appears to have lusted after her since childhood \u2014 are not spelled out. Presumably she feels indebted to him for his loyalty to her family (of which he frequently reminds her) and for her own worldly success; she is also a headstrong girl who clearly enjoys her acting career and is bent on challenging her uptight mother (who opposes the match because Keshav does not belong to their caste, just as she opposes cinema itself because of its presumed disreputability). Once the two are wed, Usha is shocked to find Keshav continuing to act as her \u201cbusiness manager\u201d, (After effects) arranging starring roles for her opposite heartthrob Rajan (Anant Nag), who is himself in (unrequited) love with her. Since Keshav's other business ventures are unsuccessful, the family remains entirely dependent on Usha's earnings \u2013 a fact that Keshav clearly resents. He thus becomes both a jealous husband with a fragile ego and nasty temper, as well as (in effect) a greedy pimp who compels his wife to take risqu\u00e9 work despite her dislike of her co-star and her protests that she \"only wants to be a housewife\" now that their daughter has been born. Not surprisingly, the relationship becomes increasingly poisoned, particularly by Keshav's suspicion (fed by star-magazine gossip) that she is having an affair with Rajan. Verbally and physically abused by her husband and periodically obliged to live in a hotel, separated from her daughter and mother, the desperately unhappy actress eventually does instigate two unsatisfying liaisons: with the nihilistic and self-centered director Sunil Verma (Naseeruddin Shah), with whom she plots a double-suicide (which he foils), and then with the wealthy businessman Vinayak Kale (Amrish Puri), who keeps her as a pampered mistress on his palatial estate. Here Usha briefly finds a kind of \"respectability\" as a de facto second wife, earning a measure of love and admiration from Kale's mother, son, and bedridden first wife \u2014but (as she learns one day when she tries to take the boy to a nearby fair) at the cost of even the most rudimentary freedom. Unable to abide by Kale's hypocritical domestic rules, she finds her only hope of escape in the intervention of the hated Keshav, who promptly brings her back to a Bombay festooned with billboards of her own face, and to the same drab hotel and lonely prospects. As Kale's bitter wife remarks to Usha as the latter prepares to leave, \"The beds change, the kitchens change. Men's masks change, but men don't change.\u201d The movie does not clarify the reason why Usha likes, and then dislikes Rajan. The climax of the movie is gloomy, and the viewers are left on their own to seek its message.  The film was based on autobiography of the doyenne of Marathi theatre and cinema Hansa Wadkar during the 1940s and 50s. The biography was told to journalist Arun Sadhu, who used the title of hit musical,Sangtye Aika (1959) or \" \"Listen, and I'll Tell.\" The film was set in Maharashtra region. Benegal's previous film were based in Andhra region, and since he was unfamiliar with the region, he roped in screenwriter and playwright Girish Karnad to co-write the script. Another noted theatre director and playwright Satyadev Dubey wrote the dialogues. The story moves back and forth across flashbacks to the early life of Wadkar. Apart from the non-linear narrative and the film also employed the film within film device. Lead actress, a 22-year-old Smita Patil still new to the medium, found the role daunting initially, yet as the filming progress, playing the multi-layered character, she found not only her space the industry and went to win the Best Actress Award for her performance, and today it is considered it one of the best performance of her career.

        "full_text": " Black is a 2005 Indian drama film directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and starred by Rani Mukerji and Amitabh Bachchan. Black revolves around a deafblind girl, and her relationship with her teacher who himself later develops Alzheimer's disease. The film draws inspiration from Helen Keller's life and struggle. Black was a commercial success and was the 2nd highest grossing Bollywood film worldwide in 2005. The film was screened at the Casablanca Film Festival and the International Film Festival of India. It won the Filmfare Award for best film. Time Magazine (Europe) selected the film as one of the 10 Best Movies of the Year 2005 from around the globe. The movie was positioned at number five. Indiatimes Movies ranks the movie amongst the 25 Must See Bollywood Films. The film was premiered in the March\u00e9 du Film section of the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. Amitabh Bachchan received his second National Film Award for Best Actor at the 53rd National Film Awards, his fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actor and his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for his performance and Rani Mukerji won her second Filmfare Award for Best Actress. A remake of this film was produced in Turkey in 2013 titled Benim D\u00fcnyam.   The film begins with Michelle McNally (Rani Mukerji), a blind and deaf woman, visiting her former teacher Debraj Sahai (Amitabh Bachchan), who now has Alzheimer's disease, in a hospital. The film then flashbacks to the past to her childhood. Michelle was a girl who lost her eyesight and hearing after recovering from an illness at the age of two and exists in a black world where she is isolated in the darkness of her own existence, trapped by her inability to see, hear and express. She grows up becoming more and more frustrated by the black and dark world around her, making her a violent, uncontrollable eight-year-old child. Her parents, Paul and Catherine, are at their wits' end trying to control her, until one day the light shines through the end of the tunnel. Debraj Sahai enters their lives, an elderly alcoholic teacher for the deaf and blind, Debraj sees himself as a magician and is a disillusioned eccentric man. He takes it upon himself to bring young Michelle into the light. He uses harsh methods, although always for Michelle's long-term benefit. Initially, his methods are met with disapproval by Michelle's father, who asks Debraj to leave. Although her father thinks he is gone, Debraj stays as the teacher while her father is away on business for 20 days. Her mother grudgingly approves of his continuation given her fear of Michelle being sent to an asylum. By the 20th day, Debraj manages to teach Michelle some words and better manners, but he has difficulty teaching her the meaning of words. When Michelle's father returns, Debraj packs his bags. At the very last moment, as he is walking towards the door suitcase in hand, Debraj gets frustrated with Michelle's continuing insolent behaviour and he throws her into a fountain full of water. Michelle suddenly takes to Debraj's lessons at that moment and begins to understand meaning. She is able to recognize her mother and father, and can vocalize the first syllables of some words small enough for her to understand. The McNallys decide to keep Debraj as Michelle's teacher. Many years later, Michelle has learned a great deal, becoming relaxed and expressive, and she is even able to dance and expertly sign. Debraj convinces the principal of a university to grant her an interview which she passes and gets admission to pursue a Bachelor of Arts degree, the first deaf-blind person to do so at that university. Michelle moves away from home and lives with Debraj and one of her servants. Over the next 2 years, she struggles to gain her Bachelor of Arts degree, failing year after year, but she still maintains her spirit. One reason is that she must rely on Debraj completely for interpretation of the material and studying. This problem is overcome by the Principal of the school preparing the whole first-year Arts course of study in Braille. Another reason for her continuing failure is that her typing skills are lacking and typing is her only way to write down what she knows during exams. However, she also soon overcomes this deficiency through another flash of increased competence when she almost quits the university and gets into an argument with Debraj. At the same time as Michelle suffers through and triumphs over her challenges, we also witness numerous other changes. Debraj begins to succumb to Alzheimer's, first forgetting the way out of the Principal's office and then forgetting Michelle and leaving her stranded during an ice cream celebration for her improved typing. We also see Michelle reconcile with her sister Sara, who we find out was jealous of her parents' affection for Michelle throughout her life. After attending Sara's wedding, Michelle begins to wonder about love, which she has not experienced, and she even asks Debraj to kiss her on the lips. Debraj reluctantly does so but decides to leave Michelle on her own because of this demand and the position she has put him in. Twelve years after enrolment, Michelle does manage to gain her BA, and with her proud parents looking on her, she even gives a speech to the graduating class. Wearing no black graduation robe, she thanks her parents and her teacher and she announces that she will only wear the robe so that her teacher may see her first. Debraj is in a mental hospital due to his almost complete inability to remember his past and even how to speak. Michelle visits him wearing her robe and we see glimmers of memory return as Debraj realises that she has graduated and even does a victory dance. As the window opens to the rain outside, we see Debraj's hand in Michelle's reaching into the rain, and we hear the teacher-student pair say the first syllable of the word \"water\", with echoes of the scene in which Michelle first begins understanding the meaning of words earlier in the movie. However this time, it is Debraj who is beginning to learn to speak and understand. The movie ends with a scene of Michelle amongst a crowd of people all dressed in black carrying candles walking towards a church. There is a voiceover of a letter Michelle has written to Debraj's friend Mrs Nair explaining that today was her teacher's first day of school, and that like hers, his alphabet began with \"B L A C K\". Sanjay Leela Bhansali first came up with the idea for Black in 1995 while filming Khamoshi: The Musical. He was inspired by Helen Keller's autobiography The Story of My Life and visited the Helen Keller Institute to do research. He also read the autobiography of deaf-mute pianist Geraldine Lawhorn for ideas. Much of the film was based on his observations between students, teachers and parents at the Institute. Bhansali originally planned for the film to be a low-budget film in Hindi and English which would provide a change from his prior film, the expensive Devdas. A self-described \"diehard fan\" of Amitabh Bachchan since he was a child, Bhansali was able to cast him after Bachchan watched Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and approached him about starring in one of his films. When Bhansali first approached Rani Mukherjee to play the role of Michelle McNally, she declined because she believed it was too challenging for her. To prepare for his role, Bachchan watched documentaries. Rani Mukherjee wore coloured contacts to give her the appearance of a blind girl and both Bachchan and Mukherjee studied sign language and Braille for seven months. A team of deaf-blind students were also on set advising the actors and instructing them in sign language. The film was shot in Mumbai and in Shimla. Parts of pre-independence Shimla, were recreated by production designer Omung Kumar, who later worked with Bhansali on Saawariya (2007), in Film City, Kamalistan Studios and Mehboob Studios across Mumbai. The sets of Black were closed to prevent details about the film from leaking. The cast and crew experienced many difficulties during the film's shooting. During filming in February 2004 a fire broke out at the 15,000-square-foot (1,400\u00a0m2) Mumbai set, destroying costumes and props. The fire was started in the night when a plug sparked and ignited. Bhansali was forced to start the indoor sets from scratch. Also, during the outdoor shoot in Shimla the script required snow but there was none so the crew brought in snowmaking machines from Mumbai and created a man-made snowy landscape. Permission to shoot at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study's Viceregal Lodge was initially denied, delaying the film further. Constantly on the sets of this movie was 'Zamir Dhale' \u2013 also a deaf-blind, proficient in tactile signing language. He stayed in Shimla during the time of the shooting to help Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee understand the world of the blind and the deaf. He also taught them the usage of sign language and how to communicate with such people. Black was originally scheduled to be released on 10 December 2004, but Bhansali decided to postpone its release. Black was released on 4 February 2005 in 170 different towns in India, a small number compared to most large-budget Bollywood films. Black was also screened at several international film festivals like the Casablanca Film Festival. Black was met by mostly positive reviews. Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukerji won the filmfare critic's acting awards also, besides the best actor and actress awards. The performances of Amitabh Bachchan, Rani Mukerji and Ayesha Kapoor were especially praised by critics. Richard Corliss of Time magazine selected it as one of the best films of 2005. It was also listed at number one on the Indiatimes' list of 25 Must See Bollywood Movies. Black grossed around \u20b9225 million (US$3.5\u00a0million) making it the eleventh highest grossing Bollywood film of 2005. It was designated as an \"average\" financial success by Box Office India However, the film was the highest grossing Bollywood film overseas in 2005 and was the 2nd highest grossing film worldwide. In addition, Black earned approximately $754,819 in the US and \u00a3473,862 in the UK. Black had overseas gross of US$7.45 million. A. R. Rahman was originally roped in to score the music, but he had to refuse due to busy schedules. The film's music is composed by Monty Sharma. Unlike many other Bollywood films, Black has only one song, \"Haan maine chookar dekha hain\", performed by Gayatri Ganjawala.",

        "full_text": " Bol Radha Bol is a 1992 Hindi film directed by David Dhawan and starring Juhi Chawla and Rishi Kapoor in the lead roles.The film is perhaps best remembered for the hit track \"Tu Tu Tu Tara\". The film was a big hit at the time of its release and was one of the highest grossing films of the year. Juhi Chawla received a Filmfare Best Actress Award nomination for her performance in the film. The success of the film was attributed to its leading lady, Juhi Chawla due to her immense popularity at that time. The song \"Tu Tu Tu Tara\" tune was copied from a song from tamil movie Thalapathi \"Rakkama Kaiya Thatu\" which was later dubbed in Hindi as \"Janeman Aaja Aaja\".   Kishen Malhotra is an industrialist who heads the Malhotra empire. His relatives are his mother (Sushma Seth), his uncle (Alok Nath) and his cousin Bhanu(Mohnish Behl). One day, he finds his cousin defrauding the company and banishes him from the house. To expand his business, Kishen decides to investigate prospects in a village. Here he meets a village belle named Radha (Juhi Chawla). Besides his work, Kishen starts teaching English to Radha and some other people in village. Kishen and Radha slowly fall in love with each other. Unknown to Kishen, somebody is stalking him and reading his mails. Kishen leaves the village (and Radha) and promises to come back. On reaching home, Kishen is surprised to see a mourning at his home. He is even more confused to see people looking astonishingly at him. But, he gets a shock of his life when he sees the portrait of his mother, signifying that his mother is dead. The real sucker punch comes when he sees his duplicate mourning next to his mother's portrait. When he tells that he is Kishen, his duplicate claims the same. When he prods the duplicate to tell something about real Kishen, the duplicate astonishes him by telling him about his life as well as about Radha. Kishen is unable to think as to how the duplicate could know about Radha, but he knows that his pet dog will identify the real master. When the dog, too, goes to the duplicate, Kishen is thrown out of his own home. Meanwhile Kishen learns about sudden death of one of his old servants, and he smells foul play. He somehow succeeds to infiltrate into his own office, which is now run by his duplicate. But, he gets arrested. Another servant tells Kishen about his mother's accident, which probably killed her. Kishen also notices that Bhanu is back in home. Meanwhile, Radha comes to meet Kishen in the city. But, when she sees \"Kishen\" partying with some girls, she thinks that Kishen has forgotten her. She turns to go back, but the real Kishen has escaped police custody. He stops her and explains the whole story. He, Radha and Goonga (Shakti Kapoor), a dumb convict who has escaped with Kishen, plan to set things straight. The trio hide themselves in a boat which takes them to Goa. Here, Kishen meets a girl who calls him Tony. Slowly, he comes to realize that his duplicate's name is Tony Braganza. Tony works as a saxophonist in a Goan club called Three Aces and has a girlfriend there. Kishen starts gathering all information about Tony. The trio return to Mumbai. Radha pretends to be a girl named Rita and gains access to Kishen's home. Kishen has identified key players by now: Bhanu, Tony and Inspector T.T. Dholak (Kiran Kumar). He creates a rift between the trio. An enraged Tony threatens to expose his partners by what he calls his trump card. The angered partners take him to the real head behind the game, who is revealed to be Kishen's uncle. Now, Tony shows his trump card \u2014 he tells them that Kishen's mother is still alive and his men have kept her in captivity. She knows nothing about Tony or the events happening. Meanwhile, Kishen discovers the depth of the trio's planning. He finds that his dog could not identify him as it was not his dog. Like Kishen, his dog, too, had been replaced. Now, Kishen comes back, impersonating Tony and makes Tony's partners throw Tony out the same way Kishen was thrown. Tony comes to the place where he has hid Kishen's mother and convinces her that he is Kishen. Kishen arrives there, too. Kishen's mother tricks the duo and finds out who is her son. Just then, all the villains show up at Tony's den. Kishen's uncle goes on to explain that he never liked the way his dead brother left the entire estate to Kishen's mother. He explains that Bhanu was not the only one looting the money. When Bhanu was thrown out, he went till Goa to find him, where he met Tony.

        "full_text": " Border is a 1997 Indian war drama film based on the Battle of Longewala during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, produced and directed by J. P. Dutta. The film starred an ensemble cast of Sunny Deol, Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Khanna, Jackie Shroff in pivotal roles. The film is an adaptation from real life events that happened at the Battle of Longewala during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. The film was screened retrospective on August 13th 2016 at the Independence Day Film Festival jointly presented by the Indian Directorate of Film Festivals and Ministry of Defense, commemorating 70th Indian Independence Day. It was the highest grossing Bollywood film of the year 1997.   The film opens before the declaration of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. At a forward operating airbase, Indian Air Force Wing Commander Anand 'Andy' Bajwa, setting his stopwatch, waits for the air raid siren to go. As the siren goes, he sprints towards his MiG-21, armed, fuelled and ready for take off. Bajwa and his air force wingmen soon take off to an unknown airbase in Rajasthan. Once there, he is debriefed by his superior that he and his squadron are assigned to the Jaisalmer sector and have to fly the outdated Hawker Hunter Ground attack planes (with no night vision capabilities) to support the Indian Army. He is soon joined by his brother-in-arms army Major Kuldip Singh Chandpuri (played by Sunny Deol) as they meet on a courier flight and speak about the possibility of opening of the Western front in light of the East Pakistan conflict. Kuldip takes up command of a company of the 23rd Battalion Punjab Regiment, arguing the light defence being assigned to the military post of Longewala. He meets his second-in-command 2nd Lieutenant Dharamveer Bhan (Akshaye Khanna) (who happens to be the son of a 1965 Indo-Pakistani War veteran who was killed during that war) and the Company JCO Naib Subedar Mathura Das (Sudesh Berry). The company moves to a remote outpost in the deserts of Rajasthan and begin to expand the rudimentary Border Security Force (BSF) post and does observation of the area up to the international border with Pakistan. They meet the post's BSF commandant Bhairon Singh (Sunil Shetty), a deeply patriotic man who expresses his love for the desert. During a night patrol, Kuldip, Dharamveer and Bhairon Singh come across a suspicious bunch of locals who turn out to be insurgents having informed the identities of the company to the Pakistani military. The trio get into a brief firefight killing all but one of the insurgents when Dharamveer hesitates to shoot the surviving insurgent, as he has never killed anyone. Kuldip severely derides him and shoots the insurgent himself, prompting Dharamveer to vomit. A badly shaken Dharamvir is comforted by Bhairon Singh and the two reminisce about their personal lives. Dharamveer recounts how he met his fiancee Kamla (Pooja Bhatt), a lively girl from his native village whom he had fallen for and how he got his mobilization orders on the day of his engagement to Kamla. Bhairon Singh recounts his wedding night, his first night with his bride (played by Sharbani Mukherjee), when he was called back to post and how he bids a tearful goodbye to his newly-wed wife Phool Kanwar. The unit is joined by the charismatic Subedar Ratan Singh (Puneet Issar), a man of insatiable appetite and wit, with two 106mm jeep-mounted RCL guns to serve as an anti-armour unit. The company wireless operator picks up a spy transmitting from a nearby area and Dharamveer sets out to investigate. He ambushes the spy and kills the man, bringing the body back to the post to prove that he has overcome his fear of killing. The unit settles down to wait for the enemy as they keep track of the developing events on the radio. The Indian army starts moving forces to nearby locations preparing to attack if Pakistan tries to open the Western front. This gives hope of soon-to-come action for the men tired of the long wait in the hot and desolate desert. Naib Subedar Mathura Das is granted leave to attend to his wife (who is ailing with cancer) and children. The men receive letters with news from back home and talk among of themselves of the people they left to serve their country. On the evening of 3 December 1971, the unit receives word that the enemy has attacked with Pakistan Air Force planes bombing multiple Indian airbases and that war has been officially declared by the Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi. Dharamveer Bhan and five of his soldiers are sent to patrol the border in a section; Bhairon Singh and his men are assigned to clear out the nearby villages. As Bhairon Singh is briefing the villagers on evacuation, Pakistani artillery batteries start shelling Indian positions and villages. Kuldip joins in the evacuation as heavy shelling occurs, leveling a whole village. In the meanwhile Dharamveer and his patrol spot Pakistani tanks (Chinese Type-59's) and infantry crossing the border into India. He reports back the enemy movement to Kuldip and is ordered to secretly follow the tanks without engaging them. Kuldip radios for air support and speaks to Wing Com Bajwa, who tells him that there can be no air support as his base has only Hunter-Fighters (which mentioned above cannot fly at night). Bajwa tells Kuldip to defend the post as long as possible and that he and his pilots would be in the battlefield at the first stroke of light. In despair, Kuldip radios his CO and explains his untenable position. He is given the option of either holding his post or retreat. He stays. Kuldip then gives the company the choice to leave the post or not, and they all prefer to stick with him and face the Pakistanis to their deaths. As the unit digs in to face the enemy assault, Mathura returns and apologizes for deserting the men of his company. Kuldip thanks him for returning in time and assigns him to a M-40 RCL Jeep unit, promising Mathura that he will return to his family when the war is over. The post is surrounded by massed enemy armor and infantry while the shelling from across the border continues relentlessly. Fortunately, Kuldip manages to get the company to bury anti-tank mines around the post to prevent the tanks from barging in. Upon seeing one of his tanks being blown by one of the mines, the Pakistani commander Ghulam Dastagir hurls expletives at Kuldip addressing him by name and tells him to retreat or die. Kuldip lashes back and swears and insults Dastagir, addressing him by name. The Pakistani tanks open fire on the post and the battle begins with Kuldip ordering Mathura to destroy the tanks with his RCL units. Though the tide of the battle improving for the Indians at first, Mathura's RCL Jeep is hit by a tank shell, wounding him and prompting Bhairon Singh to extract him from the burning jeep. Mathura is fatally wounded when he goes to extract a recoil spring for Bhairon Singh's MMG and dies in Bhairon's arms. Subedar sacrifices himself to throw away an exploding tank shell to prevent several of his men from being killed. Another tank targets Bhairon's machine gun nest and destroys it, wounding Bhairon. He charges the same tank and destroys it with an anti-tank mine, killing himself and the Pakistani soldiers inside. Dharamveer breaks through the enemy cordon and returns to post, but his entire patrol is wiped out in the process. The Pakistani commander orders a bayonet charge on the Indian position but the attack is beaten back by the Indians with Dharamveer being severely wounded. The Indians capture a Pakistani private who reveals that the Pakistani column plans to capture Jaiselmer by morning, Jodhpur by afternoon, and reach Delhi by night. As dawn nears, the Pakistanis launch a last-ditch attempt to overrun Longewala post with their massed assault of tanks and infantry, ignoring the danger of the anti-tank mines. Kuldip arming himself with an Anti Tank Rocket Launcher and a Bagful of Grenades gathers the remaining of his depleted force and prepares for a suicide counter-attack on the advancing enemy. The Indians engage in vicious hand-to-hand fighting with Kuldip jumping from tank to tank lobbing grenades down the turret hatches and killing tank commanders with Pistols. Dawn has broken as the fight heats up and Bajwa's Hunter squadron finally takes off from the Jaisalmer Base to aid Kudip's besieged company. The Pakistani attack breaks as tanks after tanks are hit by the planes firing bullets till they retreat across the border. The battle ends as a soldier tries to tell Dharamveer Singh about the victory and realizes that he is dead. The unit is relieved as Indian tanks and artillery arrive and more air-strikes beat back enemy reinforcements. The end credits roll as the Indians launch their counter-offensive and news of the deceased reach their homes, much to their families' sorrow. During production and filming both the Indian Army and Air force was responsible for its generous contribution in providing vehicles, rifles and machine guns as well as uniforms and tactics used by Pakistani Army during the Battle of Longewala. T-55 tanks resembled Chinese origin Pakistani Type-59s, weapons of the 70s era like Bren machine guns and SLRs as well as Air force Planes like Hawker Hunters and MiG-21s were shown. All the actors especially Sunny Deol, Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Khanna and Jackie Shroff were nostalgic and felt elated and honored to be a part of such an epic War Movie. The music is composed by Anu Malik while the lyrics are penned by Javed Akhtar. The songs of the film are not only popular in India but also in Pakistan. Border intended to make an appeal against war. Thus, the end of the movie depicted most soldiers dead and the trauma it caused to their family members. The lyrics of song \"Mere Dushman Mere Bhai\" sung by Hariharan criticises war and describes its disastrous effects, with the lines \"Hum Apne Apne Kheton Mein Gehoon Ki Jagah Chaanval Ki Jagah, Ye Bandookein Kyoon Botein Hain.... Jab Dono Hi Ki Galiyon Mein, Kuch Bhooke Bachche Rotein Hain....!!\" (\"Why do we grow guns in our farms instead of wheat and rice, when children in our countries cry due to hunger....\") In 2013, it was announced that Dutta would undertake sequels to Border, and that Border 2 would star Sangram Singh and Nafisa Ali\u2019s son Ajit Sodhi.",

The film stars Shammi Kapoor, Rajshree, Pran, Mumtaz, Jagdeep, Sachin and Asit Sen. The music was by Shankar Jaikishan. The film became a box office hit and won several awards, including Filmfare Best Movie Award. It was later remade in Tamil as Enga Mama (1970) and in Telugu as Devudu Mamayya (1981).   Brahmachari (Shammi Kapoor), an orphan with no identity, takes care of many orphans in his home. Being poor, it is hard for him to take care of their every need. One day he saves a young woman Sheetal (Rajshree) from committing suicide. She's in love with Ravi Khanna (Pran) who is promiscuous. Brahmachari promises to unite her with Ravi in return for money. Day and night he works on her appearance to make Ravi like her, but Brahmachari falls in love with her along the way. When Ravi proposes to Sheetal, she realises she loves Brahmachari. Ravi, however, brings in pressure on Brahmachari in terms of forfeiture of the mortgage on Brahmachari's house, due to non-repayment of loans. Ravi convinces Brahmachari into giving up Sheetal by promising to repay the mortgage dues in exchange, to which Brahmachari reluctantly agrees. In order to convince Sheetal, Brahmachari pretends to be romantically involved with Rupa. However, when Rupa tries to leave her newborn child at Brahmachari's house, Brahmachari finds out that the child's father is Ravi. He also gets hold of love letters written by Ravi to Rupa, which he intends to use to convince Ravi to marry Rupa. Ravi however doesn't relent and instead orders the kidnapping of Brahmachari's orphans. A fight ensues and the children are rescued. A repentant Ravi apologizes to Brahmachari and agrees to marry Rupa. Brahmachari and Sheetal get married and along with the children, set off on a road trip in Brahmachari's car. Music scholar and film expert Rajesh Subramanian opines that the song \"Aajkal Tere Mere Pyar Ke Charche\" was a rejected tune, which a depressed Jaikishan played to Shammi Kapoor at Hotel Gay Lord. Kapoor found the tune very catchy and suggested to director Bhappie Soni to include the song in Brahmachari. The song became one of the highlights of the film. Also the song \"Aajkal Tere Mere Pyaar Ke Charche\" , is usually thought to be sung by Lata Mangeshkar but it was in fact sung by Suman Kalyanpur. (The confusion results from the fact that the quality of Suman Kalyanpur's voice is similar to Lata Mangeshkar's at times).",

        "full_text": " Bunty Aur Babli (Hindi: \u092c\u0902\u091f\u0940 \u0914\u0930 \u092c\u092c\u0932\u0940, translation: Bunty and Babli) is a 2005 Bollywood crime-comedy film directed by Shaad Ali and starring Rani Mukerji and Abhishek Bachchan. Amitabh Bachchan stars in a supporting role. It was the first film to feature Amitabh Bachchan and his son Abhishek Bachchan, and featured guest appearances by Aishwarya Rai and Tania Zaetta. It was one of the biggest hits of the year. Though the lead actor Abhishek Bacchan was shown living in Fursatganj, those scenes were shot in Agra. The plot, although drawing on the idea of two rather lovable crooks, does not contain violence. Each of the adventures of Bunty and Babli are thoroughly Indianised, like the fake selling of the Taj Mahal. It draws comparisons to the American classic Bonnie and Clyde but without dark elements, and the lead characters do not die a bloody death (unlike their American counterparts).   Rakesh Trivedi (Abhishek Bachchan) comes from a small village. His father is a ticket collector on the train and wants him to get into a similar occupation as well. However, Rakesh has big dreams; he is forever coming up with new business plans and is convinced he will make it big one day. He adamantly refuses any notion that he will one day work in a 9-to-5 environment. Vimmi Saluja (Rani Mukerji) is the daughter of a Punjabi family in another small village; she spends her hours watching films and studying supermodels. She dreams of becoming Miss India. Vimmi's parents tell her they have arranged her marriage to a young man with a decent job. At the same time, Rakesh's father gives him an ultimatum \u2013 go on the job interview he has arranged or get out of the house. Rakesh and Vimmi pack their bags and sneak out in the dark of the night. They bump into each other at a train station and become friends after realising their stories are similar. They support and encourage each other to achieve their dreams: Vimmi tries to enter the Miss India contest but gets thrown out after an argument. Rakesh tries to sell his ideas for an investment scheme, but a businessman turns him away. In fact, a man he had met at a restaurant stole ideas from Rakesh's presentation file and, when he enters the office, the interviewer states someone before him came in with the same idea. After finding out that the businessman who Rakesh approached has used his idea to make money, he and Vimmi con him and take money they believe is rightly theirs. Once they realise how easy it is to con people, they decide to run some more cons to raise money to make it to Bombay. Unfortunately for India, they find the lifestyle too exciting to give up. Adopting the names of 'Bunty' and 'Babli', they successfully pull off con after con, looting rich people dressed as local guides, religious priests, health inspectors, business partners, etc. Their flamboyant antics make them famous in newspapers nationwide. Soon their friendship leads to romance and they decide to continue conning the rich as husband and wife. Little do Rakesh and Vimmi know that JCP Dashrath Singh (Amitabh Bachchan) is catching up with their cons and pranks, getting closer each day. He relentlessly pursues them across India in the hopes of putting them behind bars. To complicate matters, Rakesh and Vimmi have a child and, after a very close call eluding Dashrath, they decide to quit conning for their child's sake. This decision leads to their capture by Dashrath. While in custody, their heartfelt confessions and conversation soften the policeman's heart and he lets them go, certain he has destroyed Bunty and Babli's career as criminals. Three years later, Dashrath rescues them from their mundane domestic lives by offering them to work for the nation thwarting the activities of other scammers. The film was a critical and commercial success becoming one of the biggest hits of 2005. Designer Aki Narula dressed Rani Mukerji a new look Patiala salwars and kurtis, which became quite popular. A. R. Rahman was initially approached to compose the film's music, but he declined due to his busy schedule. The soundtrack includes six tracks composed by the musical trio Shankar Ehsaan Loy and was released on 13 April 2005 by Yash Raj Music. The lead actors Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukerji danced to the tunes of the album. The lyrics were penned by Gulzar and Blaaze. The music of Bunty Aur Babli received favourable reviews from almost all critics. Sukanya Verma of Rediff, said in her review, \"On the whole, the music of Bunty Aur Babli, with its over the top, uninhibited, rustic and teasing spices, makes for one helluva musical masala.\" Planet Bollywood's review concluded, \"Overall, Shakhar-Ehsaan-Loy do an excellent job of getting different singers for each track, trying to infuse different beats together and creating an album worth buying. It\u2019ll take a few listens to pick your favourites, but its fresh and an above average album to own. Enjoy!\" \"Bunty Aur Babli does not contain your routine Yash Chopra genre of music that are choreographed around the meadows and Swiss alps. They are more of situational rhythmic tracks that take a story forward\" Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama said in his review. The Glamsham was full of praise for the lyrics by Gulzar, \"Throughout this zany zingy and zippy album the 70-year-old Gulzar imbues a youthfulness that comes from being young at heart. Indeed that's the quality, which flows freely out of this album. You can't miss its zest for life\u2026 or its lunge towards a luscious nirvana obtained from looking at life through rose-tinted glasses.\" Avijit Ghosh wrote in The Telegraph, \"In essence, Bunty Aur Babli is an on-the-road flick about a boy and girl in search of fun and freedom rather than a story of two cons. To capture the splintered yearnings of smalltown India which watches Aastha channel in the morning and FTV at night is a difficult and ambitious task. But like his protagonists, director Shaad Ali Sahgal pulls it off. Bravely. Almost.\" 10 \"Kajra Re\" was voted as the best of 2005 overwhelmingly by listeners of three radio stations catering for South African Indians. Hidekaz Himaruya, the manga artist who created Hetalia, embedded the video of \"Dhadak Dhadak\" on his blog around Christmas time, which caused a sudden influx of Himaruya fans commenting on the video. The glorification of crime in the movie inspired many people to emulate the glamorous couple, resulting in a trend of real-life Buntys and Bablis. One such case is that of Shushant and Kajal, a married couple who conned two businesses out of money using a photo frame. \"The Darjeeling-based couple did a 'Bunty Aur Babli' on their victims, and were caught and arrested.\" Another case of the movie's influence on crime is that of another married couple, Suresh and Rekha. Their crimes also mirrored those committed in the movie \"Bunty Aur Babli\", and they admitted to committing the crimes they were accused of in a \"Bunty Aur Babli\" style. Yet another couple, a sister and brother-in-law, were caught for crimes that mirrored those committed in the movie. Shahnaaz Bano and Sajid Ahmed were caught smuggling and shoplifting diamonds and other expensive merchandise out of stores, using disguises. The movie was so popular that it created a trend of crime shows the power and influence of Bollywood movies on India. The crimes that the characters commit in the film include petty crime and scamming, which are already popular in India (see Crime in India). With the influence of the movie, people are starting to see such crimes as a glamorous way to get rich quickly, not realizing the consequences. Unlike Bunty and Babli for the majority of the movie, those who try to emulate their crimes get caught.",

India) is a 2007 Indian sports film, directed by Shimit Amin and Rob Miller (sports scenes), produced by Aditya Chopra, with music by Salim\u2013Sulaiman and a screenplay by Jaideep Sahni. It explores religious bigotry, the legacy of the partition of India, ethnic and regional prejudice and sexism in contemporary India in a fictional story about the Indian women's national field-hockey team which was inspired by the team's win at the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The film stars Shahrukh Khan as Kabir Khan, former captain of the Indian men's national field-hockey team. After a disastrous loss to Pakistan, Khan is ostracized from the sport and he and his mother are driven from the family home by angry neighbors. Seven years later, to redeem himself, Khan becomes the coach of the Indian national women's hockey team and aims to turn its sixteen contentious players into a championship unit. Chak De! India won a number of awards, including the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. On 30 August 2007, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences requested a copy of the film's script for a place in its Margaret Herrick Library. When the Indian Hockey Federation was reorganised in April 2008, former player Aslam Sher Khan said that he wanted \"to create a 'Chak De' effect\" in Indian hockey. The film was screened in New Delhi on August 17, 2016, as part of the week long Independence Day Film Festival. The festival was jointly presented by the Indian Directorate of Film Festivals and Ministry of Defense, commemorating India's 70th Independence Day.   Chak De! India opens in Delhi during the final minutes of a fictional Hockey World Cup match between Pakistan and India, with Pakistan leading 1\u20130. When Indian team captain Kabir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) is fouled, he takes a penalty stroke. His shot just misses, costing India the match. Soon afterwards, media outlets circulate a photograph of Khan shaking hands with the Pakistani captain. The sporting gesture is misunderstood, and the Muslim Khan is suspected of \"throwing\" the game out of sympathy towards Pakistan. Religious prejudice forces him and his mother (Joyshree Arora) from their family home. Seven years later Mr. Tripathi (Anjan Srivastav), the head of India's hockey association, meets with Khan's friend\u2014and hockey advocate\u2014Uttamaji (Mohit Chauhan) to discuss the Indian women's hockey team. According to Tripathi, the team has no future since the only long-term role for women is to \"cook and clean\". Uttamaji, however, tells him that Kabir Khan (whom no one has seen for seven years) wants to coach the team. Initially sceptical, Tripathi agrees to the arrangement. Khan finds himself in charge of a group of 16 young women (each representing a different state), divided by their competitive nature and regional prejudices. Komal Chautala (Chitrashi Rawat), a village girl from Haryana, clashes with Preeti Sabarwal (Sagarika Ghatge) from Chandigarh; short-tempered Balbir Kaur (Tanya Abrol) from Punjab bullies Rani Dispotta (Seema Azmi) and Soimoi Kerketa (Nisha Nair), who are from remote villages in Jharkhand. Mary Ralte (Kimi Laldawla) from Mizoram and Molly Zimik (Masochon \"Chon Chon\" Zimik), from Manipur in North-East India, face widespread discrimination and sexual harassment. Team captain Vidya Sharma (Vidya Malvade) must choose between hockey and the wishes of her husband Rakesh's (Nakul Vaid) family, and Preeti's fianc\u00e9\u2014Abhimanyu Singh (Vivan Bhatena), vice-captain of the India national cricket team\u2014feels threatened by her involvement with the team. Khan realizes that he can make the girls winners only if he can help them overcome their differences. During his first few days as coach he benches several players who refuse to follow his rules\u2014including Bindia Naik (Shilpa Shukla), his most experienced player. In response, Bindia repeatedly encourages the other players to defy Khan. When she finally succeeds, Khan angrily resigns; however, he invites the staff and team to a farewell lunch at McDonald's. During the lunch, local boys make a pass at Mary; Balbir attacks them, triggering a brawl between the boys and the team. Khan, recognizing that they are acting as one for the first time, prevents the staff from intervening; he only stops a man from hitting one of the women from behind with a cricket bat, telling him that there are no cowards in hockey. In an about-face, after the fight the women ask Khan to remain as their coach. The team faces new challenges. When Tripathi refuses to send the women's team to Australia for the World Cup, Khan proposes a match against the men\u2019s team. Although his team loses, their performance inspires Tripathi to send them to Australia after all. The tournament begins with a 7-0 loss to Australia, followed by victories over England, Spain, South Africa, New Zealand, Argentina and South Korea. They are again matched with Australia for the final; this time, they defeat the Hockeyroos for the World Cup. When the team returns home their families treat them with greater respect and Khan, his good name restored, returns with his mother to their ancestral home. Shortly after the film's release the media began referring to the 16 actresses who portrayed the players as the \"Chak De girls\". The panel of judges at the Screen Awards also used the term, awarding the 2008 Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress to the \"Chak De girls\". A brief article about the victorious women's team at the 2002 Commonwealth Games inspired screenwriter Jaideep Sahni to create a film about the Indian women's hockey team, and he modeled Kabir Khan on hockey coach Maharaj Krishan Kaushik. After listening to the storyline Kaushik suggested that Sahani meet hockey player Mir Ranjan Negi, who faced accusations of throwing the match against Pakistan in the 1982 Asian Games. According to Sahani, he was unaware of Negi's plight while he wrote the script and any resemblance to Negi's life was coincidental. Negi agreed, saying that he did not \"want to hog the limelight. This movie is not a documentary of Mir Ranjan Negi's life. It is in fact the story of a team that becomes a winning lot from a bunch of hopeless girls\". Responding to media reports equating Kabir Khan with Negi, Sahani said: \"Our script was written a year and a half back. It is very unfortunate that something, which is about women athletes, has just started becoming about Negi.\" Shah Rukh Khan stated in a speech delivered at the University of Edinburgh that the phrase Chak De! was originally \"an inspirational martial cry that Sikh soldiers used while lifting logs in order to make bridges across rivers on their campaigns against their enemies. It implies the will to get up and get on with it.\" I felt why has the girls\u2019 team been given so little coverage. I shared the idea with Aditya (Chopra). He liked it and said stop everything else and concentrate on it. I started my research by spending time with hockey players ... It\u2019s just a matter of chance that Negi's story matches with Kabir Khan. There are many cases, like in Colombia, football players are killed for not performing well for the club. I had no idea about Negi\u2019s story while writing the script, and he joined us after the script was ready. In fact, his name was suggested by M.K. Kaushik, who was the coach of the team that won the Commonwealth Games\u2019 gold. On day one, when Negi read the script, he cried and it was then that we came to know about his story. Although Salman Khan was initially signed for the lead role, he later withdrew due to creative differences with the director. Shah Rukh Khan (who had originally declined due to a scheduling conflict with Karan Johar's Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna) was later confirmed as Kabir Khan. Khan accepted the role partly because he used to play hockey in college: \"I feel hockey as a sport has been monstrously neglected in our country. I used to play the game during college. In fact, I was quite a good hockey player. So the role was a lot like going back to my past.\" Some media sources called the actor's role offbeat, since it departed from his usual romantic image and included neither lip synched songs nor a single female lead. Casting of the 16 actresses as the hockey players took over six months. Amin described the process as \"very, very difficult\" and \"very strenuous because the requirement was they had to play \u2013 and act\". A four-month training camp was held where the girls learned the rules of the game, took acting lessons and followed a strict diet; safety precautions were also taken. According to Amin, \"Learning hockey is very tricky unlike, say, football. You have to know how to hold the stick, how to manoeuvre it, so it doesn't look fake on screen ... For those who were originally players, we had to make sure they were able to act as well. The dialogue was weighty; it isn't frivolous. It has to be delivered with a certain tone, in a certain manner\". The actors, including Khan and the rest of the supporting cast, participated in a number of rehearsals and script readings before principal photography began. Kaushik and his team taught the crew \"all [they] knew about hockey\". In an interview, he later said that he \"taught him (Sahni) everything about the game, starting from how the camp is conducted, how the girls come from different backgrounds and cultures, the psychological factors involved. Also how the coach faces pressure to select girls from different states and teams\". After Negi was suggested, the latter assembled a team of hockey players to train the actors. He later said that he \"trained the girls for six months. Waking up at 4, traveling from Kandivili to Churchgate. We would retire around 11 in the night. It was tiring. But we were on a mission ... They couldn't run; couldn't hold the hockey sticks. I ensured none of them [would have to] cut their nails or eyebrows (as the players do). The girls have worked very hard. I salute them\". Some of the actors, such as Chitrashi, Sandia, and Raynia, were cast because they were hockey players. Rob Miller was the Sport Action Director, and worked with Negi to train the actors. About working with Khan, Negi recalled that everything was planned \"including the penalty stroke that SRK missed. That shot alone took us nearly 20 hours as I was keen that it should be very realistic. I took the help of a lot of my former teammates. But more importantly, it was so easy working with SRK. He is unbelievably modest and was willing to do as many re-takes as we wanted\". Chak De! India was filmed in India and Australia (Sydney and Melbourne), with ReelSports Solutions casting 90 hockey players and 9,000 extras. Chak De! India premiered on 9 August 2007 at Somerset House in London to an audience of over 2,000 during the Film4 Summer Screen and India Now festivals. It was released globally in theaters on 10 August 2007, playing on only 400 screens in India because of the commercial failure of Yash Raj Films's two previous films. Due to the film's strong critical response, theaters reported 80-percent occupancy for its opening weekend. Chak De! India topped the Indian box office during its first two weeks, and played to full houses during its first two months. The film was particularly successful in large cities. By the end of its theatrical run Chak De! India was the third-highest-grossing film of 2007 in India, with domestic earnings of \u20b950,54,00,000. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave Chak De India a rating of 91 percent based on 11 reviews (10 \"fresh\" and one \"rotten\"). On Metacritic, the film had a score of 68 from four critics, indicating generally favorable reviews. In an NPR interview via affiliate WBUR-FM, Mumbai Mirror columnist Aseem Chhabra called Chak De! India \"an example of a film that's been made within the framework of Bollywood and yet it is a very different film. It does take up some realistic issues, and what I really liked about the film was that the women who acted, you know, who are part of the team, each one of them got a chance. Their personality, their characters, were very well-written, and so, the superstar in the film was Shahrukh Khan, who was the coach of the team; he doesn't sort of take over the whole film. Every supporting character gets a role, and it's a very inspiring movie that really changed the mood in India. People loved it\". Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film four out of five stars stating that it was a film of \"great performances by a bunch of unknowns.\" India Today called Chak De! India \"the most feisty girl power movie to have come out of Bollywood ever.\" Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu wrote, \"At another level, Chak De is about women's liberation. It is one of the best feminist films of our times.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"Chak De's ... a winner all the way.\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called the film \"the most authentic, meticulously researched sports movie India has made\". In Kolkata's Telegraph, Bharathi S. Pradhan wrote that the film combines \"an extremely well-knit screenplay with unrelentingly deft direction, 16 unknown, and not even glamorous, girls simply carried you with them, with one single known actor compelling you to watch Chak De India without blinking\". Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave Chak De! India four out of five stars stating that \"while the tale of the sporting underdog is hardly new, Jaideep Sahni's screenplay offers a rare look at a popular Indian sport often overshadowed by cricket.\" Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that the film gave a fresh look to the conventional underdog sports film, comparing its premise to the U.S. victory in the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. Derek Elley of Variety called Chak De! India \"a patriotic heartwarmer that scores some old-fashioned entertainment goals.\"  In The Hollywood Reporter, Kirk Honeycutt wrote that the \"technical credits are first rate with excellent cinematography, quicksilver editing, musical montages of practice and a fine use of locations.\" Michael Dequina of themoviereport.com was more critical of the film, giving it 2.5 out of four stars and calling it \"a very familiar, very formula underdog sports movie with nothing to distinguish it from similar, equally slick Hollywood product.\" Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide gave Chak De! India two stars out of four, writing that the film uses \"sports-movie conventions to address larger cultural and political issues, and while it doesn't miss a cliche, it also invests every one with vigorous conviction.\" Although Subhash K. Jha gave the film 3.5 stars, calling it \"a fairly predictable story\" with dialogue \"quite often the stuff bumper stickers are made of\", he wrote that \"Chak De India is an outright winner\" and \"one of the finest sports-based dramas in living memory.\" Khalid Mohamed gave the film 3.5 stars in the Hindustan Times stating that the film \"may be predictable but compels you to root for a team of losers whom only an earth-angel can save from disastrous defeat\". Apart from critics, Chak De! India tied with Taare Zameen Par for the Best film of 2007 according to various Bollywood movie directors such as Madhur Bhandarkar, David Dhawan, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, Anurag Basu, and Sriram Raghavan. Chak De! India has become an influential film. The title track song \"Chak De! India,\" now doubles as a sports anthem in India and is played at numerous sports events. According to Salim Merchant, the song \"almost became the sports anthem of the country, especially after India won the Cricket World Cup . It was no longer our song but the country's song\". After India's World Cup victory, Indian team player Virat Kohli \"sang 'Chak de India' to the crowd\". When India defeated South Africa at the 2015 Cricket World Cup, Nitin Srivastava of the BBC noted: \"MCG has erupted with \"Vande Mataram\" (the national song of India) and \"Chak De India\" (Go India!) slogans in the air! And there's no age barrier for cricket fans who came and enjoyed the match\". In addition, the suspension of the Indian Hockey Federation in April 2008 also indicated the film's influence. India Today used the title to label the event in two articles, titled \"Operation Chak De impact: Jothikumaran resigns\" and \"Operation Chak de impact: Furore in Lok Sabha\". The Indiatimes, in an article titled, \"Five wise men set for a Chak De act\" also argued, \"It looks like Indian hockey has done a real Chak de this time around\". In addition, former hockey player Aslam Sher Khan, who was appointed by the Indian Olympic Association to head a committee which will replace the IHF, pointed to the film as a model to work towards. He stated in an interview, \"We have to make a Team India as you have seen in Bollywood blockbuster Chak De! India. There are players from several parts of the country. We have to unite them to make a powerful force.\" In another interview, he emphasised that he wants \"to create a Chak De effect\" on hockey in India. Chak De! India's soundtrack, composed by Salim\u2013Sulaiman with lyrics by Jaideep Sahni, was released on 1 August 2007.",

The rights of this film now belong to Shah Rukh Khan's Red Chillies Entertainment.   The film begins in a bowling alley, where a group of friends are awaiting the arrival of Salim. Meanwhile, Deepak arrives with his fianc\u00e9e Sheetal. When a conversation about love arises, Deepak and the rest find it necessary to make Sheetal aware that true love does exist. They tell her the story of Raj (Shah Rukh Khan) and Priya (Rani Mukerji), two of their closest friends. Raj Mathur is the owner of Raj Transport, a small trucking company he founded himself. Raj is a carefree man who is unorganised, messy, lazy and late all the time. Although he isn't the richest, he's always happy. On the other hand, Priya Chopra is a successful fashion designer whose family is quite wealthy. Priya, originally from Greece, lives with her aunt Anna, who wants to give her the best in life (wealth and success). Priya has her life all planned out\u00a0\u2013 the complete opposite of Raj. These two completely different people meet in a car accident, when Priya crashes her car into Raj's truck. Though the two get off to a rocky start, they meet again at the wedding of Salim and Farah, eventually becoming friends. The two arrange to meet again and slowly fall in love. Raj receives Priya's phone number but carelessly loses it. He then sets out to find her and he does find her. However, Raj learns that Priya's engaged. Desperate, he follows Priya to Greece, where he continues to woo her. When it's time to part company, Priya realises that she is in love with Raj. They get married after persuading Priya's parents, and arrive in Mumbai, where Raj welcomes Priya into their home. He then makes an oath to his holy talisman, wishing it to protect Priya if he is not around, because he loves her immensely. Back to the bowling alley in the present: Sheetal is in tears, for she has never heard a more beautiful story. Salim arrives along with Farah and announce that today was Raj and Priya's first wedding anniversary, so they were planning a surprise party. Excited, Sheetal can't wait to meet the famous Raj and Priya, but when they do arrive, they're nothing like what they seemed. A year has changed both Raj and Priya, and the two can't stop arguing. When they do find some common ground and happiness, it doesn't last long. Raj feels the pressure to meet the expectations of Priya's family, and is struggling financially. His company has gone bankrupt, and he has many bills and loans to pay. When he is insulted by a bank official, he returns home crying. Priya cannot stand to see her husband in this state, and resorts to asking her former fianc\u00e9 for money. When Raj asks her about the source of money, she lies. But when he throws a celebration party, he learns the truth. Angry at Priya, he becomes destructive, and Priya, heartbroken, runs away to her parents. Raj, realizing his error, goes after Priya, only to be insulted by her family. Priya decides to leave for Greece because she can't stay with Raj but can't stay without him. When Raj is informed of this, he races to the airport to stop Priya, just as he did the year before. He says he will change and that he has a dream of the two of them starting a family together. Although Priya expresses that she has the same dream, she feels it is impossible for them to be together, so she boards the plane. Giving up, Raj remembers his oath and sends his talisman to Priya. When Priya receives the talisman, she too recalls Raj's confession. Raj returns home to find Priya waiting for him. She says that the only way to make their dream come true is to be together. In a playful manner, the two get into another argument but they say that this is how they express their love. They continue to argue as the credits roll.

The film stars Tabu and Atul Kulkarni in lead roles. It also stars Ananya Khare, Rajpal Yadav, Minakshi Sahani and Vishal Thakkar. The film was a critically acclaimed hit and it won four National Film Awards.   Mumtaz (Tabu) is a naive young rural woman whose family is killed in communal riots. After her village is burnt to the ground, she moves to Mumbai with her uncle, the only family member she has left. They are desperately poor and her uncle persuades her to become a bar girl (dancer) at Chandni Bar. He promises her that this is merely temporary, until he is able to get a job. Mumtaz is shy and loathes the work, but she forces herself to dance and flirt. However, her uncle doesn't keep his word; he lives on her earnings, drinking them away, and never gets a job. One night, after spending time drinking and watching the girls dance at the bar, Mumtaz's uncle rapes her. Mumtaz is distraught and emotionally confides in the other dancers. Even though they console her, Mumtaz is given a reality check when she realises that many other women at the bar have equally disturbing and painful stories. She manages to pull herself together and immerses herself in her work at the bar. Eventually, Mumtaz catches the eye of a gangster called Pottya Sawant (Atul Kulkarni). He attempts to seduce her, and finally resorts to paying her for sex. Mumtaz, however, cannot go through with the deed and tells Pottya about her rape. Enraged, Pottya kills her uncle and marries Mumtaz. Mumtaz leaves the bar, and Pottya rises up the criminal ranks quickly, despite his volatile temper. The couple live a happy life, together with their son, Abhay, and daughter, Payal. Mumtaz wishes for Abhay and Payal to be educated, and stay far away from her world of dancing girls and Pottya's world of gangsters. Pottya's attitude and temper cause him to prematurely kill another gangster, which results in him losing friends and connections in the criminal world. He becomes a target for the police, and is captured and killed in an operation to 'eliminate' various Mumbai gangsters. A grieving Mumtaz slowly runs out of money and soon realises that Pottya has left behind a large amount of debt. With no source of income, she is forced to return to work at Chandni Bar. Years pass, and Mumtaz still works at Chandni Bar, not as a dancer, but as a waitress. She manages to provide a stable environment for Abhay and Payal, who are now teenagers. Mumtaz encourages her children to do well in school, so that they can move away from their surroundings of crime and gangs. Abhay is very studious and performs well in classes, but soon befriends a group of trouble makers and delinquents. Despite being warned by Mumtaz, he continues to see his friends. One day, Abhay and his group are arrested by police for extortion, and held in a juvenile prison. Even though he was not part of the crime, his reputation as Pottya's son causes the police to ignore his pleas of innocence. Later on at the prison, Abhay is raped by a pair of older inmates. Mumtaz attempts to talk to the police, to no avail. She then meets with some influential people, who have police connections and can get Abhay released. They agree to help her, but demand a high price, which she must bring to them in less than two days. Mumtaz has no choice and decides to sell her body in order to obtain the money, but is still short. Seeing her mother's plight, Payal takes up dancing at Chandni Bar and brings the rest of the money to her troubled mother. Having secured the money, Mumtaz is able to get Abhay released. However, she notices that he is not the same happy boy he was a few days earlier. Instead, he is cold, ruthless, and is looking for revenge. Abhay makes connections in the crime world and manages to get a gun, which he uses to kill the boys who raped him. Mumtaz arrives on the scene and is devastated to find that her son has become a killer. It is implied that Payal is following in her mother's footsteps, and Abhay is set to be another Pottya. The film won four National Awards. Tabu also received Best Actress nominations at the Filmfare Awards and Bollywood Awards. Atul Kulkarni also received a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the Star Screen Awards. Madhur Bhandarkar was nominated for Best Director in several venues, but did not win. 2002 National Film Awards (India) 2002 IIFA Awards (India) 2002 Star Screen Awards (India) 2002 Zee Cine Awards (India) The film does not feature any of original tracks of its own.

The profits of this musical brought an end to Chopra's lean phase. The platinum success of its music was also instrumental in bringing music back into Hindi films. For the cast, the film reaffirmed Sridevi's position as the top female star of the 1980s. It prolonged Rishi Kapoor's fading career and showed that he was still profitable as a leading hero. Chandni provided a boost for Vinod Khanna's career and reunited Kapoor and Khanna, who last performed together in the popular Amar Akbar Anthony (1977). Sridevi's white costumes became popular as the 'Chandni Look,' and the songs of the film are still a rage. Though this was not the first time Yash Chopra shot a film in Switzerland, the extensive scenes shot there made it a popular tourist destination for Indians. Chandni won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film of 1989 and is regarded as one of the Yash Chopra's best films.\u0926   Rohit (Rishi Kapoor) meets Chandni (Sridevi) at a wedding of her relative and falls instantly in love with her.

As she's waiting, the afternoon's silence is broken by the roaring blades of a helicopter. Rohit appears and proceeds to shower Chandni in red rose petals from the copter. When he disappears, she is surrounded again by silence, but she has a feeling something has happened. Seconds later, Chandni hears the phone ringing and runs to answer, knowing it is Rohit.

Learning that he is paralysed on his right side, his family continues to berate her. Knowing that in his paralyzed condition he would never be able to make a partner/lover/husband to Chandni, Rohit decides to push her away and starts to berate her, which is too much for Chandni to bear and makes her want to leave him.

To her amazement, he stands up and does a little dance. They are keyed up with emotion and Rohit proposes to her. Chandni tells him she is committed to someone else. When Rohit becomes angry, Chandni asks him what he would have done in her place. He regretfully leaves. As Rohit and Lalit had become good friends in Switzerland, Lalit invited him to his wedding.

The lyrics were provided by Anand Bakshi. In addition to the songs listed below, there was a recurring instrumental love melody, not part of a full song.

Talking about her role in Chandni, Sridevi said it was \"a lively and vibrant girl in the first half (who) becomes quiet and goes into a shell in the second half. I loved that transformation and when you have a director like Yash Chopra at the helm, you can be sure that he will make the best out of everything.\"",

The film features Shahrukh Khan and Deepika Padukone in lead roles; it is the second collaboration between Khan and Padukone after Om Shanti Om (2007). The film is about a man's journey from Mumbai to Rameswaram, and what happens along the way after he falls in love with the daughter of a local don. Principal photography began on 27 September 2012, filming began in October 2012 and was completed by May 2013. Chennai Express was released in the overseas markets on 8 August 2013, and a day later in India. Extensive paid previews were held in India on 8 August as well. Although the film received mixed reviews from critics, it broke several box office records in India and abroad, becoming the quickest film to collect \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million) net domestically at that time. The film currently ranks as the eighth highest grossing Indian film of all time.   Rahul Mithaiwala (Shah Rukh Khan) is a forty-year-old bachelor living in Mumbai. His parents died in a car accident when he was eight years old, so his grandparents raised him. Rahul's grandfather (Lekh Tandon) owns a chain of confectionery shops. Before his grandfather's 100th birthday celebration, two of Rahul's friends invite him to accompany them on a vacation in Goa, which he accepts. Rahul's grandfather dies on the eve of the celebration, just when he witnesses Sachin Tendulkar on TV in a cricket match get dismissed on his 99th run. His grandmother tells Rahul that his grandfather wanted his ashes to be divided into two parts\u2014one of each to be immersed in the Ganges and Rameswaram. She asks Rahul to take the ashes to Rameswaram and disperse them. Reluctantly, he accepts her request but is also eager to attend the Goa trip. Rahul and his friends plan to dump the ashes at Goa but his grandmother wants to see him off, forcing Rahul to travel by train. He books a single ticket on the Chennai Express, planning to meet his friends along the way, at Kalyan Junction station . However, Rahul forgets to take the ashes, and he almost misses the train when he returns to collect them. As he tries to leave the train, he notices a young woman running to board it. He helps her and four other people board the moving train, but the train leaves the station before he can get off. Rahul tries to flirt with the woman, who starts communicating by singing parodies of Hindi film songs, and explains that the four men are trying to kidnap her. Rahul lends her his mobile phone so that she can contact her friends, but the men with her grab it and throw it from the train. Rahul is annoyed, but says nothing because the men are carrying weapons. Rahul tells the ticket inspector about them, but they push the inspector into a river below a bridge. Panicked, Rahul learns that the men are her cousins, and that her name is Meenalochni \"Meena\" Azhagusundaram (Deepika Padukone). She is fleeing from a forced marriage to Tangaballi (Nikitin Dheer). Her father, Durgeshwara Azhagusundaram (Sathyaraj) is a powerful headman of the local mafia in Tamil Nadu. Meena takes Rahul to her father and introduces him as her lover. Tangaballi challenges Rahul to a duel that Rahul unknowingly accepts, due to his lack of knowledge in Tamil. On the night of the duel, Rahul escapes with the help of a local policeman, Shamsher (Mukesh Tiwari), but he ends up on a ship with Sri Lankan terrorists and smugglers. A gun battle ensues between the police force and the terrorists. When the police officers investigate and take Rahul into custody, he tells his story and ends up back in Komban. Terrified and once again surrounded by Azhagusundaram's sickle-wielding henchmen, Rahul pretends to take Meena hostage and escapes with her in her father's car, battling Azhagasundaram's men. When the car breaks down, Rahul and Meena quarrel and part ways. Rahul, not knowing which way to go, returns to Meena, who takes him to the Vidhamba village. Meena tells the villagers that they are a married couple who needs protection and rest, to which the villagers agree. Meena then realises that she has fallen in love with Rahul. When Rahul plans to sneak away, she argues, not wanting to earn the villagers' distrust. Tangaballi catches Rahul as he tries to leave, but the villagers help them escape again. Meena persuades Rahul to disperse his grandfather's ashes and travels with him to Rameswaram, where they complete the rites. On their way back, Rahul realises that he has fallen in love with Meena, and does not tell her where they are going. He takes Meena back to her father and tries to make him understand and honour his daughter's wish. He also tells Meena that he loves her. Rahul tells Tangaballi and his goons that he is ready for the fight this time. In the fight that follows, Rahul is severely injured but emerges victorious. Meena's father and Tangaballi reform, accepting that the love of a common man like Rahul is bigger than their physical ability and political influence. Azhagusundaram allows Rahul to marry Meena. Rahul then leaves a message that love knows no regional or language barriers and that with a strong heart, there is no limit to what the common man can achieve. Mayank and Rohit Shetty had originally planned to team up for a remake of the 1982 film, Angoor. After the 2011 blockbuster Singham, Shetty had begun writing the script of the film but left it half-finished. The script of Chennai Express was ready for Shah Rukh Khan as a back-up, because of the difficulty of obtaining the actor's filming dates. Upon reading the script, Khan liked the idea and agreed to star in it before the Angoor remake, causing Angoor's remake to be postponed. Shetty said the film is \"a hard-core commercial film with a romantic angle. The story is about this man's travel from Mumbai to Rameshwaram and what happens during the journey.\" About 68 minutes of footage were enhanced with CGI by Reliance MediaWorks. Shah Rukh Khan was the first actor to be approached with the script and was the first lead actor to be signed for the film. Rohit Shetty stated that despite the title, Khan would not play a South Indian in the film. The casting of the lead heroine was the subject of much press speculation; Kareena Kapoor, Asin and Deepika Padukone were rumoured to be involved. Shetty denied those rumours, stating that the cast would be finalised in April 2012, and that he was going to cast an established actress in the role. In October 2012, it was confirmed that Deepika Padukone had been signed to play the female lead opposite Khan, and photographs showing Padukone and Khan shooting were released. This was Padukone's second film opposite Khan, with whom she made her Bollywood debut in the 2007 blockbuster Om Shanti Om. Starting with this film, which was released on Women's Day, Khan wished to have the name of his female co-star appear above his own in the credits. Sathyaraj was cast to play the role of Padukone's father\u2014the film's main antagonist\u2014making his debut in Bollywood. Actress Priyamani was signed in January 2013 for an item number in the film. Other personalities from Tamil cinema, including Delhi Ganesh and Mohan V. Raman, appear in minor roles. Filming on the project began at Mehboob Studio in Mumbai on 5 October 2012. additional filming was done at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station with a minimal crew. Stills of the lead actor were unofficially released in mid-October 2012. In November 2012, the cast and crew went to Goa to begin filming the scenes set there. Vasco da Gama railway station was used to portray as Kalyan Junction railway station. A romantic scene on board a train passing next to Dudhsagar Falls was also shot. In December 2012, the crew went to Jakarta to film certain scenes. In January 2013, a shoot was supposedly scheduled to take place in Ooty, but since Khan felt that Ooty was too far from Mumbai, several locations from Ooty were reconstructed on the outskirts of Panchgani in Wai by the art director Narendra Ruharikar. It took over 40 days and \u20b9 15 million to build the required sets. Filming in Wai took the entire month of March 2013. A 10-day shooting schedule in Munnar, Kerala, began in mid-April 2013; scenes were filmed at Devikulam Lake, Meesapulimala, Wagavara and Kannimala. Filming was stopped for several days because of heavy rainfall, resulting in the schedule being slightly extended until end of the same month. A press conference was held in Munnar. In May 2013, scenes were filmed in North Goa. Padukone finished shooting on 25 May 2013. Khan flew to Hyderabad in May 2013 to film his remaining scenes. The film has several Tamil dialogues, but to retain context no subtitles were used. The score of Chennai Express was composed by Amar Mohile; the songs were composed by the duo Vishal-Shekhar, and the lyrics were written by Amitabh Bhattacharya and Yo Yo Honey Singh. Recording of the songs began in late October 2012. The track \"Ready Steady Po\" was recorded in November 2012 by the music's composers. Several sources said that the director and actor were unsatisfied with the score. The director was reportedly asked to plan for a different musical composition. However, the composers denied these rumours. In mid-April 2013, singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam recorded the title track for the film, marking his return to Bollywood for playback after an absence of fifteen years. He said the song celebrated the spirit of togetherness. Initially, Balasubrahmanyam was apprehensive, but chose to sing due to the content and leads of the film. The song \"1 2 3 4 get on the dance floor\" was released as a promotional single on World Music Day. On 27 June 2013, the video promo of the song \"Titli\" was released, and on 11 July 2013, the promo video of \"Kashmir Main Tu Kanyakumari\" was released. On 19 July 2013, T-Series uploaded a song to its official channel on YouTube; sung by Honey Singh. The song was titled \"Lungi Dance \u2013 The 'Thalaivar(r)' Tribute\" in honour of the film actor Rajinikanth. On 25 July 2013, a promotional video of the song \"Tera Rasta Main Chhodoon Na\" was released. The music album was launched on 1 July 2013. The soundtrack album of Chennai Express received positive reviews. Devesh Sharma of Filmfare gave the album 4/5, saying that it is \"a robust offering, which is full of new sounds and zany surprises\", and that Vishal-Shekhar put in a lot of effort to bring out their best for the film. IBN Live gave the album 3.5/5 and stated that the album was another \"winner\" from Vishal-Shekhar. The composers were critically praised for blending different forms of music which \"pepped\" the otherwise usual Bollywood music. Yashika Mathur of DNA gave the album 3.5/5 and said that Chennai Express is \"another winner from Vishal-Shekhar\" that \"boasts of a soothing bouquet of typical Bollywood numbers and some peppy tracks with exceptional mixing.\" She wrote that it \"is likely to appeal to music lovers of all age-groups and sentiments\" and called it \"[a]n entertaining all-rounder, the composers must be applauded for fusing different music and beats to pep up the otherwise usual Bollywood music.\" Joginder Tuteja of Rediff.com gave the album 3/5 and wrote that the title song, \"Chennai Express\", is \"just about average\". He expressed his displeasure over Balasubramaniam's ill-suiting of voice for Shah Rukh Khan, and said that in all the song was not remarkable. He however complimented that the overall outcome was \"satisfactory\" with a few of the songs even standing out. Anand Holla of Mumbai Mirror said, \"It's easy to imagine director Rohit Shetty's crystal clear brief to Vishal-Shekhar, involving words such as catchy, peppy, fun, and of course 'hit songs'. Given how happily formulaic the soundtrack has turned out, V\u2013S have given us a fair idea of what awaits us this Eid.\" The film had paid previews in India on 8 August 2013, with ten to twelve shows at multiplexes. Chennai Express was scheduled to be released in non-traditional international markets. In Peru, it was the first Hindi film to be released on the same day as in India. Chennai Express was also released in Morocco, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, and Israel. The price of tickets for Chennai Express was increased 40 percent above the usual tariff during the weekday shows and up to 20 percent on weekends; although this increase was not uniformly applied in all multiplexes. The film was released in 2,550 cinemas across 3,550 screens in India, and across 700 screens internationally\u2014including 196 screens in the United States, 175 in the United Kingdom, 55 in the Middle East, and 30 in Australia\u2014the widest Bollywood release up to that point. A first look of Chennai Express was released on 1 January 2013. A thirty-one second title track teaser, sung by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, was released on 23 May 2013. The official trailer of the film was released at an event in Mumbai on 13 June 2013; two days after its launch it exceeded four million views on YouTube. A platform running game titled Chennai Express: Escape from Rameshwaram, based on the film and featuring Shahrukh Khan & Deepika Padukone, was developed by Disney UTV's digital wing, and launched on 24 July 2013 for Android systems. In the game, the player rides a virtual roller-coaster, fighting off goons and dodging obstacles while they attempt to collect over 10,000 coins in order to unlock Padukone's game avatar. The outfits worn by Khan and Padukone in the film were auctioned; proceeds from the sale were donated to a charity. The auction took place around the day of the film's release. A Karaoke app developed by Singbox\u2014a Swedish gaming studio\u2014was launched on 2 August 2013 for Android and iOS based smartphones. Khan promoted his film on the reality television shows Comedy Nights with Kapil, Madhubala Ek Ishq Ek Junoon, DID Super Moms, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 6 and Indian Idol Junior. The Zeitgeist\u2014Google's year-end compilation of the most frequent search queries\u2014named Chennai Express the most trending topic of 2013 in India. The film's satellite television rights were sold to Zee Network for \u20b9480 million (US$7.4\u00a0million). The agreement was linked to the film's box office revenue\u2014the first deal of its kind in Indian cinema. If Chennai Express collected over \u20b91.3 billion (US$20\u00a0million) net, then for every \u20b9100\u00a0million earned after that, the producers would get an additional \u20b920\u00a0million. The film had its television premiere on 20 October 2013, and was seen by a record number of viewers, almost doubling that of the highest rated fiction show. It helped its broadcaster, Zee TV, to reach the top position among General Entertainment Channels that month. Along with Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara!, Chennai Express was initially abandoned by Pakistani distributors and exhibitors because four Pakistani films were released on the same day. The release dates were postponed to 15 and 9 August, respectively. During its Wai schedule of filming, the film's unit ran into trouble for using too much water from Dhom Dam, in the drought-stricken Satara district of Maharashtra. The state's relief and rehabilitation minister, Patangrao Kadam, addressed the problem. The film's poster and trailer, released on Twitter and YouTube, were criticised by some Tamil media for their depiction of Tamil ethos. They said Padukone's heavily accented dialogue resembled a Malayalee accent rather than a Tamil one. Padukone defended the film, saying that it did not parody South Indian culture and that most of the crew, including herself, are South Indians. She later said, \"Why would we spoof our own culture?\" On 31 July 2013, the Nationalist political party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena's film wing threatened to disrupt the film's premiere; it reportedly attempted to dislodge ongoing popular Marathi movies from cinemas that show only one film at a time. The party was upset with reports that the distributors of Chennai Express had demanded prime slots in single screen cinemas, and at some multiplexes, where the superhit Marathi film Duniyadari had been popular since 19 July. On 1 August 2013, both the film directors, Rohit Shetty and Sanjay Jadhav were called on by Raj Thackeray to find a solution. After listening to both parties, Thackeray ruled that if Duniyadari was not removed from single screen cinemas across the state, then the MNS would not object to the release of Chennai Express in Maharashtra. Chennai Express received mixed reviews from critics worldwide. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the movie 4 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"On the whole, 'Chennai Express' has the trademark Rohit Shetty stamp all over. You seek entertainment, entertainment and entertainment in a film like 'Chennai Express' and the movie lives up to the hype and hoopla surrounding it.\" Rachit Gupta of Filmfare rated the movie 4 of 5 stars, stating, \"The film's peppered with humorous set pieces and colourful locales and songs. Rohit Shetty makes chettinad-style masala movies. And that's the perfect description of this film. If you don't plan to engage in a multi-lateral critique of dramatic elements and narrative, this film can be fun.\" Sarita Tanwar Of DNA gave the movie 3.5 of 5 stars and said, \"This is a treat for all Hindi film lovers. It has all the ingredients you'd expect from a big commercial masala film\u2014big star cast, drama, action, comedy, songs, the car chases and the big finish, all delivered in Rohit Shetty's unapologetic ishtyle\u00a0...\u00a0Overall, this is a bubblegum blockbuster.\" Meena Iyer of Times of India gave the movie 3.5 of 5 stars, saying, \"Chennai Express is a magnificently mounted film. In an ode to his own cinema\u2014read Golmaal series or Bol Bachchan, Rohit Shetty, the director, who has grossers in Bollywood's 100-crore club, ups the scale for his Eid offering.\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the movie 3 of 5 stars and said that, \"The whole-hearted zeal that SRK and Deepika bring to the table and the steady flow of funny one-liners serve Shetty's purpose well, turning Chennai Express into a full-on masala film that is completely unapologetic about its intentions. And that is its USP [Unique Selling Point].\" Zee News rated the movie 3 of 5 stars, stating that if one ignores the platitudes, the absence of \"punch\" in the script and predictability, then the person is \"onboard for a fun ride\" with Chennai Express. India Today gave the film 3 stars: \"The good news first. 'Chennai Express' is a pleasant and likeable film in parts. The bad news is, it does nothing for Shah Rukh Khan's imdomitable star power except to tell us he can still play a 40-year [old] Rahul without faltering.\" Abhishek Gupta of India TV gave it 2.5 stars and wrote, \"The comedy along with the action is rarely served with equal entertainment in today's cinema. We discern Rohit Shetty for his mass leisure which includes cars fluttering from the unknown corners and comedy which isn't slapstick but works.\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the movie 2.5 out of 5 stars, and wrote that the film comes up with some genuinely funny moments. She commended Padukone's looks, although she criticized aspects of her stagecraft skills. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the film 2.5 stars, saying, \"Chennai Express evokes a few laughs but otherwise it decides to shift tracks from droll comedy to dreadful drama.\" Khalid Mohamed of Deccan Chronicle gave the film 2.5 stars and wrote, \"board Chennai Express at your own risk\". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 2/5 rating and said the film was a \"big, fat\" bore. He commented that Chennai Express was a \"bloated vanity project\", and felt that the lead actor could have performed better. Mayank Shekhar of Dainik Bhaskar rated it 1 star out of 5, saying, \"You've paid for the ticket? Yes. Now just sit back and suffer.\" Rachel Saltz of The New York Times wrote, \"'Chennai Express' feels like a sumptuous meal with carefully chosen wine and tasty appetizers but a botched main course. Money and visual care have been lavished on this Bollywood action-comedy-romance and glossy stars engaged (Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone). But the movie chugs along for most of its 2 hours and 20 minutes searching for comedy and characters in a frantically overplotted story.\" Sneha May Francis of Emirates 24/7 wrote, \"Rohit Shetty's s(h)tyle of romance relies heavily on buffoonery and will be applauded mainly by Shah Rukh Khan loyalists\". She added, \"Rohit's carnival-like comedy coaxes some laughs, but can leave you exhausted.\" Sneha said that Padukone's performance \"outshines\" that of Khan. Ronnie Scheib of Variety wrote, \"Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone are ill matched in this overworked comedy/romance/actioner\u00a0...\u00a0Shetty's need to maintain his characters' romantic heroism constantly grates against his depictions of their ridiculousness.\" Simon Foster of the Special Broadcasting Service gave the film 2 stars out of 5 and described it as \"a loud, lame-brained romantic comedy from the (very) broad directorial brush of Rohit Shetty, SRK's over-hyped vehicle sees the charismatic but ageing actor badly miscast and easily overshadowed by his leading lady, Deepika Padukone.\" At the time, Chennai Express became the highest grossing Bollywood film, both in India and around the world, collecting \u20b93.96 billion (US$61\u00a0million) by the end of its run. It currently stands as the seventh-highest grossing Bollywood film worldwide. The film's gross broke the \u20b93.92 billion (US$61\u00a0million) record set by 3 Idiots, according to Box Office India.

Raj Kapoor plays his stereotyped \"simple guy with a heart of gold\" role yet again. The story is loosely based on the \"White Nights\" written by Fyodor Dostoyevsky but is focused on the issue of estranged wives and children in the aftermath of Partition. Chhalia was shot in black-and-white. Music by Kalyanji-Anandji, played a part in the film's box office success.   Shanti (Nutan) is married off to Kewal (Rehman) on the eve of Partition. But while the two families move away to Delhi from Lahore, she inadvertently is left behind, and is forced to share roof with Abdul Rehman (Pran) who has a sister of Shanti\u2019s age in India. When she returns to India five years later with her son, she is first welcomed by the husband with open arms but disowned when the child identifies himself as Anwar, and his father as Abdul Rehman. Even her own father refuses to give her shelter, though in the years she had lived with Abdul Rehman she hadn\u2019t even seen his face. Physically and emotionally shattered, Shanti tries to commit suicide after leaving Anwar in a remand home, but is rescued by an outlaw, Chhalia (Raj Kapoor) who as time and events progress, flips for the lady. Rehman lands in Delhi to settle old scores with Chhalia, and threatens to kidnap Shanti. The bloody fight that ensues between the two adversaries eventually ends in a truce. The hurried climax, set amidst Dussera festivities, has Chhalia bringing about a rapprochement between the estranged couple, and himself walking into the infinity, while Rehman is reunited with his sister on the return train. Chhalia was the debut film of director Manmohan Desai. Chhalia was amongst the first of the lost-and-found-formula films that Desai went on to chisel to perfection (except perhaps his last two \u201cGanga Jamuna Saraswati\u201d and \u201cToofan\u201d), \u201cChalia\u201d was also first amongst his 13 star-studded films out of a total of 20 that Desai churned out in a career spanning 29 years. Laxmikant Pyarelal were the assistant music directors; who went on to be music directors for most of Manmohan Desai's films. Chhalia was released in 1960 and was a moderate box-office success. Raj Kapoor and Nutan were nominated for 1961 Filmfare Awards in the category of Best Actor and Best Actress respectively. Chhalia was made available on DVD from the Indian distributor Shemaroo and the international firm Baba Digital. Soundtrack of Chhalia is composed by the duo Kalyanji-Anandji with lyrics by Qamar Jalalabadi. The initial vinyl ep release of the soundtrack by Angel Records consisted of 4 songs sung by singers Mukesh and Lata Mangeshkar. The complete soundtrack was released by EMI with 3 new songs and an Instrumental added to the initial soundtrack. Chhalia is considered a landmark in the career of Kalyanji-Anandji. The duo composed the kind of folksy, simple tunes that had come to be associated with Raj Kapoor\u2019s collaborations with Shankar-Jaikishan. The songs \"Dum Dum Diga Diga\" and \"Chhalia Mera Naam\" are still popular today. All lyrics written by Qamar Jalalabadi; all music composed by Kalyanji-Anandji.",

The film's title means \"A Small Matter\" in Hindi. Considered one of the best Hindi comedy films of the 1970s, it is a nostalgic favourite for its quirky take on pre-hypercongestion Bombay. The film became a box office hit and also earned Filmfare nominations and a Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay for Basu Chatterjee. It also established Amol Palekar as having an uncommon comic talent for playing mousy characters, a role he would go on to repeat several times in his career. This movie is based on \"School for Scoundrels\", a 1960 British Comedy which itself was based on the \"Gamesmanship\" series of books by Stephen Potter. As with other Basu Chatterjee films, moviestars have small cameos playing themselves: Dharmendra and Hema Malini (whose mother Jaya Chakravarthy helped produce the film) are in a movie-within-a-movie for the song \"Janneman janneman,\" while Amitabh Bachchan plays himself in another scene, where he seeks advice from Ashok Kumar's character. He is dressed in costume from Zameer (1974 film), whose film poster is prominently displayed at the bus stop scenes in \"Chhoti Si Baat.\" B.R. Chopra, is the producer for Zameer (1974 film), just as he is for \"Chhoti Si Baat.\"   Chhoti Si Baat is a romantic comedy about a painfully shy young man Arun Pradeep (Amol Palekar), who lacks self-confidence and fails to stand up for his convictions, in the process letting all and sundry walk all over him. One fine day he comes across Prabha Narayan (Vidya Sinha) at the bus stop en route to work and it's love at first sight... for Arun that is. Lacking enough courage and unsure if his feelings are reciprocated, he pines for her from afar and follows her around, at a safe distance (or so he thinks). Prabha, fully aware of his affections, secretly relishes his discomfort, while waiting for him to make the first move. While Arun is hopelessly stuck, in comes the suave, brash Nagesh Shastri (Asrani), a colleague of Prabha's, and emerges a serious rival for her attention. It doesn't help that he appears to be miles ahead of Arun in the \"race\" and is all that Arun is not: He's gregarious while Arun is shy, he's confident and boastful, while Arun is besieged with self-doubt, he's smooth, while Arun is awkward, he's street smart, while Arun's na\u00efve, he's assertive while Arun is timid. Plus he owns a scooter and ensures that he has opportunities to offer Prabha a ride, while Arun can only look on. A gullible Arun, trying to match Nagesh with a motorbike of his own, is conned into buying a dud, further embarrassing him in front of Prabha. He seeks salvation in astrology, tarot cards, dubious godmen only to land with egg on his face. In desperation, he finally turns to Colonel Julius Nagendranath Wilfred Singh (Ashok Kumar) of Khandala, who has made it his mission to assist those in love find their true destiny. Colonel Singh agrees to help Arun and thus begins the turnaround as Singh begins to mould Arun into a mature, confident young man through meticulously designed lesson plans, peppered with philosophy and \"hands on\" training. A \"born-again\" Arun returns to Bombay with a distinguished swagger, brimming with newly discovered self-esteem, ready to take on the world and win over Prabha.

Pitamber Chaudhri, headmaster of a school in Madhupur, India, has a daughter named Geeta (Zarina Wahab). Geeta is a typical village belle \u2014 naive, childish, and always in the company of a little boy who is her neighbour. Pitamber's older daughter, Meera, who lives in Mumbai, informs Pitamber of the arrival of a young engineer who could be a possible match for Geeta. Pitamber is asked to welcome him and treat him well. Without further question, Pitamber and family do just that when the visitor arrives by train. Vinod (Amol Palekar), the newcomer, takes an instant liking to the family and to Geeta in particular, even teaching her to sing. The family begins to talk about the possibility of Vinod and Geeta marrying. Life is good until another letter from Meera arrives. Pitamber is shocked to read that the engineer whom Meera was sending to meet the family has not yet arrived but will be coming soon. Vinod is an overseer who happened to come early, as his boss was delayed and could not make it as planned. The family is disappointed. They ask Geeta to stop seeing Vinod and turn her attention to Sunil (Vijayendra Ghatge), the engineer, but Geeta cannot forget Vinod. Sunil is fond of Geeta and agrees to the engagement, which is quickly arranged. When Vinod hears of the engagement, he prepares to leave the village before the ceremony. Upon hearing this, Geeta insists that she will marry Vinod, against the wishes of her family. She rushes to the train station but not before the train leaves. Disheartened, she turns back and is received and driven back to her house by Sunil. To her surprise, Vinod is at the house. All misconceptions have been cleared up: Geeta and Vinod are to be engaged.

        "full_text": " C.I.D. is a 1956 Indian Hindi film. Produced by Guru Dutt, it was directed by Raj Khosla. It stars Dev Anand, Shakila, Johnny Walker, K. N. Singh and Waheeda Rehman. The movie was a crime thriller and has Dev playing a police inspector investigating a case. The music is by O. P. Nayyar and the lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri and Jan Nisar Akhtar. It was Waheeda Rehman's screen debut, and future directors Pramod Chakravorty and Bhappi Sonie worked as assistant director.   A newspaper editor, Shrivastav, is killed when he was about to expose the underworld links of a very rich and influential person. He calls over his friend, Inspector Shekhar, to talk to him about the threat he receives from the underworld. Srivastav dies by the time Shekhar arrives. He remembers that he saw a suspicious person by the elevator and borrows a lady's car to chase him. The lady (Shakila) throws a fit (and even throws the car keys in the mud when it is raining outside) and they lose the chase. In the morning the two return home when they find the keys. Meanwhile, on the crime scene, petty pickpocket Master (Johnny Walker) is found at scene and confesses seeing the whole murder. Shekhar uncovers some of the gang, and Master identifies the killer (Mehmood) who is put in jail. Meanwhile, the lady, Rekha, turns out to be the daughter of Chief of Police (K N Singh), and trust is formed. Shekhar is taken to the criminal's house in an attempt to bribe him to release the prisoner, but the attempt fails. The person who offers the bribe is Kamini (Waheeda Rehman). She spikes the drink offered to Shekhar, intoxicates him, and the gang leaves him on the street. He is found by Rekha, who brings him home. At Rekha's birthday party, Shekhar sees Kamini and follows her. Kamini turns out to be a childhood friend of Rekha. The mastermind, Dharamdas, now wants to incriminate Shekhar so that he can be clear of any fear. They take Master to a house and try to persuade him but fail. The gang kills the original killer by sending their people to jail and frame Shekhar for it. This puts the blame on Shekhar for the two murders. He goes to trial and waits for the verdict the next day. By this point, romantic feelings have grown between Rekha and Shekhar. They talk, and Shekhar does not know what to do. He is persuaded by Master to run away, knowing that he will have to prove who the real killer is by getting a chance to investigate. He runs away. Dharamdas knows when Shekhar comes out of hiding, he will have evidence to expose the mastermind. So, he sends his men to kill Shekhar. They shoot him, and Shekhar manages to reach the killer's house unseen. He is confronted by Kamini, but he convinces her she can only plan a crime, not commit one. She feels for him, realizes that Dharamdas is evil and that she should no longer be a criminal, and nurtures Shekhar nearly to health. Dharamdas returns and barely sees Shekhar escape into a hidden dungeon. Kamini follows, and it is Kamini and Shekhar vs. Dharamdas in a cat-and-mouse chase in a maze of hidden corridors and rooms. Kamini and Shekhar escape, and Shekhar calls the police station, saying that he is surrendering himself. Just before he reaches the gate of the police station, Kamini is shot by Dharamdas' men, and then Rekha's father, aka the Chief, tries to get a full idea of the picture. Shekhar explains that Dharmdas is the mastermind, yet the Chief does not believe him. Shehar explains the whole thing and that if Kamini regains consciousness, she will testify. Yet he still has to prove Dharamdas is the criminal so the Chief can see for himself, and so they have confirmation he is the criminal in case Kamini does not survive. They plant an article in the newspaper saying that Kamini will testify, knowing Dharamdas will try to kill her in the hospital. They switch Kamini into Room 15, and tell the desk clerk to tell Dharamadas that Kamini is in Room 13, where they will be waiting for him. Dharamdas comes just before Shekhar and Chief give up, and they wait. They realize that they left the door to Room 15 open, and Dharamdas realizes the actual room as well. The Chief and Shekhar come just in time before Dharamdas attempts to kill Kamini. Dharamdas is convicted, Shekhar has to face trial for running away. The Chief promises to recommend bail or dropping the charges, and Rekha and Shekhar continue their romantic feelings. The music is composed by O. P. Nayyar. The movie has only six songs but all became super hits. Dev Anand and Guru Dutt were friends when they struggled to get a break in films and had promised each other that Dev would give Guru Dutt a film to direct (which he did with Baazi) and Guru Dutt would cast Dev as a hero and direct him. As Guru Dutt did not direct C.I.D. he could fulfill only half his promise. The scriptwriter was Inder Raj Anand, father of actor-filmmaker Tinnu Anand. Guru Dutt had spotted Waheeda Rehman in a Telugu movie and cast her in Pyaasa, but gave her a key supporting role in C.I.D. to prepare her for Pyaasa. The choreography of this film was done by Zohra Sehgal, now famous for her \u2018granny\u2019 roles (e.g., Cheeni Kum). The costumes were credited to a debutant, Bhanumati, who is better known as Bhanu Athaiya. Assisting Raj Khosla on C.I.D. were Pramod Charavorty and Bhappi Sonie who went on to become successful directors in their own right.One of the lyricists was Jan Nisar Akhtar, father of Javed Akhtar, who wrote \"Aankhon hi Aankhon Mein.\" The song \"Aye Dil Hain Mushkil\" (also known as \"Bombay Meri Jaan\"), performed by Mohammed Rafi and Geeta Dutt, accompanies the end titles of the 2008 film Mumbai Meri Jaan. Famous songs of O. P. Nayyar from other movies such as Muhabbat Kar Lo Jee Bhar Lo and Jaatta Kahan Hain Deewane provided background music of this film. In the game of musical chairs on Rekha's birthday, the harmonium player plays songs of even other music composers such as Shankar Jaikishan (\"Ichak Daanaa Beechak Daanaa\") or S.D. Burman (Jeevan Ke Safar Mein Raahee, Milte Hain Bichhad Jaane Ko). Guru Dutt had reportedly gifted Raj Khosla a swanky foreign car after the success of C.I.D. It was released on 30 July 1956 with a grand ceremony.",

        "full_text": " Company is a 2002 Indian crime-thriller film directed by Ram Gopal Varma. The film starred Mohanlal, Ajay Devgan, Manisha Koirala, Vivek Oberoi, and Antara Mali in pivotal roles. It is a fictional expos\u00e9 of the Mumbai underworld, loosely based on the Indian mafia organization D-Company, known to be run by Dawood Ibrahim. It is the second film in the Indian Gangster trilogy, and a sequel to the blockbuster Satya. Upon release, the film received positive reviews from critics as well as audience, having won seven Filmfare Awards; three IIFA Awards, and went on to become one of the highest grossing Bollywood film(s) of 2002. An example of Parallel cinema, the film highlights the infrastructure of the Indian mafia organization. Company received critical acclaim at the Austin Film Festival, New York Asian Film Festival, and the Fribourg International Film Festival. British director Danny Boyle cited the trilogy as influences on his Academy Award-winning film Slumdog Millionaire (2008), for their \"slick, often mesmerizing portrayals of the Mumbai underworld\", their display of \"brutality and urban violence\", and their gritty realism.   The story revolves around a young man named Chandu (Chandrakant Nagre) (played by Vivek Oberoi) joining the world of crime in the Mumbai underworld to \"make it big\" someday. Gradually he learns the tricks of the trade and increases the gang's earnings and profits. This leads to his affinity with Malik (Ajay Devgan), the leader of the gang. The film features one cold-blooded murder scene wherein Malik and Chandu kill Saeed and his brother Anis in the rear seat of the car on a chilling rainy day. Thereafter Malik goes on a bloody rampage killing all his opponents, to take the reins of underworld in his hands. In this stage, Malik says a prominent dialogue \"Sab ganda hai par dhanda hai yeh\" (It's all dirty, but it's business). His rival gang leader and colleague under Aslam's umbrella Sharma, who was in a meeting with police inspector Rathod, is killed off. Inspector Rathod, who once tortured and abused Chandu in jail in early days, is killed at Malik's permission. However, both come at loggerheads during the execution of a contract killing. Chandu stops the deliberate vehicle crash and falls from Malik's favor. The contract was from a politician who tries to use Malik's gang to eliminate a front-runner, a contender for Home Minister's post. The assassination (a staged truck-car collision) takes place in spite of Chandu's emotional misdemeanor since Malik, not relying on Chandu anymore, gives direct orders. The rift between Chandu and Malik widens due to misunderstandings. The Commissioner of Police, Sreenivasan IPS (Mohanlal) uses the rift to bring the mafia under control. Chandu and Malik end up becoming bitter enemies. After Chandu's retaliation of the assassination of his lifelong friend of one of lieutenants Warsi, two factions of Mumbai's once most powerful gang 'Company' went to a full-scale war. Malik and Chandu killed as many members of each opponent gangs as possible. Sreenivasan, as the police chief of murders due to the war, became criticized greatly. But he and his men knew this war ultimately is shortening the to-do list of his department. Big numbers of button men and lieutenants from the gangs were being killed. The war results in an intense chase sequence shot in Kenya where Malik hires hitmen to kill Chandu. Chandu survives, though he is injured severely. Sreenivasan convinces Chandu to come back to Mumbai and fight his war with Malik by helping the police bring the mafia under control. In the climax, Chandu kills the politician (the mastermind of the contract killing) in prison. At the same time, one of Chandu's aides, Koda Singh, who swore revenge to kill who went against his friend Chandu, shoots Malik point blank to death in Hong Kong. Chandu and Malik came to a truce but Chandu never withdrew his order to Koda to kill Malik. It's not confirmed that whether Chandu has forgotten to withdraw his orders or deliberately kept that on. After the assassination, Sreenivasan notified Chandu and Chandu became tremendously shocked at this news. Koda Singh was arrested by suspicion by Hong Kong police on that day. The ends shows Chandu spending the rest of his life in prison after being persuaded by the Police Commissioner to surrender. Company received universal critical acclaim. Alok Kumar of Planet Bollywood gave the movie 9.5 stars out of 10, saying that \"Varma has brought his audience yet another innovative and enjoyable film. Company should prove to be a sound investment of time and effort for all those involved.\" Arpan Panicker of Full Hyderabad gave the movie an 8.0 rating (out of 10) and commented that \"With powerful performances, especially from the three lead actors, Company turns out to be a masterpiece you won't forget in a hurry.\" N.K. Deoshi of ApunkaChoice.com gave 4 out of 5 stars, calling Company \"a sleek, fast-paced thriller replete with violence and authentic Mumbai lingo.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 3 stars out of 5, saying that \"On the whole, COMPANY is amongst Ramgopal Varma's finest works. A stylishly narrated tale, the film will win plaudits and reap a rich harvest at the box-office for its hard-hitting content.\" Ziya us-Salam of IdleBrain gave a \"thumbs-up\" rating and said, \"Watch Company for three reasons. Varma. Mohan Lal. Vivek Oberoi. Mohan Lal in his maiden Hindi film venture, is a class act. As a South Indian cop, his accent comes in handy. Nothing overboard, everything poised about him. Limited dialogues limitless gestures. Then watch Company for Vivek Oberoi. A star son of sorts - character artiste Suresh Oberoi is his father - never once does he give you an impression that he is making his debut here. His gaunt frame, hollow cheek bones and restlessness go well with his role of a new entrant into the underworld who knows no fear, respects no reputations and lives only on some tacit principles.\" Director Ram Gopal Varma, apparently referred to Mohanlal as the Robert De Niro of Indian Cinema. The film was released on a total of 295 screens. It grossed \u20b91.18 crore on the opening day and \u20b911.08 crore from worldwide in its first week, with \u20b96.01 crore from Indian box office alone. In Mumbai, the film opened with 100 percent occupancy, which fell to 87 percent in the second week with a steady collection in the subsequent weeks. The film's first week occupancy was 86 percent in Delhi, Punjab, Hyderabad, and Nagpur. Company grossed $190,000 in its first weekend at the overseas territories and made $250,000 in a week. The film grossed \u20b923.76 crore in its final run in India, with a total of \u20b925.02 crore worldwide against a budget of \u20b99.50 crore. 48th Filmfare Awards IIFA Awards Bollywood Movie Awards Star Screen Awards The soundtrack features 8 songs composed by Sandeep Chowta, with lyrics by Nitin Raikwar, Taabish Romani and Jaideep Sahni. Company is believed to be an almost-true story based on depictions of the D-Company split between Mumbai crime lords Dawood Ibrahim and Chotta Rajan. It's said that the recruitment of Chandu to Aslam Ali's gang by Mallik was almost identical to Chotta Rajan's introduction to Dawood after Rajan's mentor and boss Bada Rajan died in the early 1980s. Company shows that Mallik's aide Yadav is interviewed by a journalist of Indian news channel Aaj Tak after their assassination attempt on Chandu in Nairobi, Kenya. The theme of this interview is an identical depiction of a real-life interview that Dawood Ibrahim's aide Chotta Shakeel gave to Indian journalist Sheela Bhatt, after an assassination attempt on Chotta Rajan in Bangkok in 2000. Company shows how the Hindi film industry went into trouble after violent split between Chandu and Mallik. Another interview of Chotta Shakeel which was given to the Times of India describes the intense circumstance inside the Mumbai film industry due to gang disputes. It appears that depiction of a dispute in Company \u2014 where fictional film star Naved Khan falls between Mallik's and Chandu's disputing gangs and becomes immensely confused \u2014 is a reference to a notable interview when Chotta Shakeel almost leaves a clarification of underworld's finance in Indian film industry. The role of Vilas Pandit, the closest aide of Malik who appeared to be the consigliere of Malik's gang, is believed to be a depiction of real-life D-Company aide, counselor and Dawood Ibrahim's confidant Sharad Shetty. Company showed Vilas Pandit was shot to death by Chandu in Hong Kong when Pandit went to Chandu's place for an unprecedented meeting; Chandu misinterpreted his appearance as an attempted hit. Real-life D-Company counselor Sharad Shetty, too, was killed outside a Dubai nightclub, by a hit carried out by Chotta Rajan. Ironically this real-life hit was carried out eight months after the release of Company which depicted a similar incident in the adopted storyline. It gained a prequel D, and the fourth installment in the series titled as Satya 2 was released in 2013.",

Shaadiram Gharjode (Sadashiv Amrapurkar) is once humiliated by Hoshiyar Chand (Kader Khan) when Shaadiram goes to inform him about a family wanting to marry their son to Hoshiyar's daughter. Hoshiyar Chand insults them as he wants both his daughters to marry into the richest family. Gharjode decides to teach Hoshiyar Chand a lesson: He meets a coolie called Raju (Govinda) and they go to Hoshiyar Chand's village pretending to be a rich family. Hoshiyar is impressed and he wants his daughter Malti (Karisma Kapoor) to marry Raju. This leads to humorous situations in the climax. The music of Coolie No. 1 was a rage when it released. Although producer of Tips films Vashu Bhagnani and director David Dhawan were extremely confident that Husn Hain Suhana rendered by Abhijeet and Chandana Dixit would be the selling factor of the album, it was the song Main To Raste Se Ja Raha Tha that did the trick. The music of Coolie No. 1 strengthened Anand-Milind and Govinda/David Dhawan's track record of coming up with super hit music with each outing.",

Made with a budget of \u20b9300 million and marketed at \u20b9120 million, Dabangg was shot primarily in the town of Wai in Maharashtra, while other major scenes were shot in the United Arab Emirates. Dabangg was released during Eid on 10 September 2010 in nearly 2100 cinemas worldwide. It opened to generally positive reviews, and went on to gross \u20b92.15 billion worldwide. It is the highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2010 and one among the highest grossing Bollywood film of all time.

It was later remade in Tamil as Osthe, and in Telugu as Gabbar Singh. A sequel, titled Dabangg 2 was released in 2012.   Chulbul Pandey, a young boy, lives with his younger half-brother, Makhanchan \"Makkhi\" Pandey, stepfather Prajapati Pandey (Vinod Khanna) and mother, Naina Devi (Dimple Kapadia) in Laalgunj, Uttar Pradesh. He has a troubled relationship with his stepfather and Makkhi. After 21 years, Chulbul (Salman Khan) becomes a policeman. Chulbul, who calls himself \"Robin Hood\" Pandey, lives with his family. Makkhi (Arbaaz Khan) is in love with Nirmala (Mahi Gill), whose father Masterji (Tinu Anand) opposes the relationship. Chulbul falls in love with a girl named Rajjo (Sonakshi Sinha), who he meets during a police encounter. A corrupt political leader named Chedi Singh (Sonu Sood) meets Chulbul and both quickly become enemies. Makkhi asks his father to arrange his marriage with Nirmala. His father refuses saying that he needs money to repay the loans he took to make his factory, so he needs his son to marry a rich girl. Makkhi, in desperate need of money, steals it from Chulbul's cupboard, and gives it to Nirmala's father in order to convince him to marry Nirmala. Meanwhile, Chulbul meets Rajjo and proposes marriage, which she rejects, as she has to take care of her father, Haria (Mahesh Manjrekar)\u2014a drunkard. Chulbul comes home to find his mother dead. He goes to his stepfather to make peace, as he is the only family left. His stepfather refuses and despises him as an outcast. Makkhi invites Chulbul to his marriage with Nirmala. Chulbul convinces Rajjo's father to marry her. Rajjo's father commits suicide, as he knows that his daughter will not marry anyone while he is alive. Chulbul takes Rajjo to Makkhi's exuberant wedding. Realising that Makkhi has stolen his money to finance the wedding, Chulbul marries Rajjo in an impromptu ceremony. Nirmala's father feels disgraced and cancels his daughter's wedding. Makkhi beats up one of the workers in his factory due to a small mishap. The worker goes to the police station with his mother to file a complaint. Chulbul beats up Makkhi in public to disgrace him. Chedi takes advantage of the situation, and takes Makkhi along with his father to the police station. Makkhi's father resolves the situation by accepting an apology from Chulbul. Chulbul meets Dayal Babu (Anupam Kher), a local political leader, who also dislikes Chedi. With his help, Chulbul adulterates the breweries of Chedi, and wrongly frames him for it. To take revenge, Chedi burns Makkhi's factory. Makkhi's father suffers a heart attack due to shock and is hospitalised. Makkhi goes to Chedi seek help from him, without knowing that it was Chedi, who burnt his factory. Chedi agrees to finance his father's treatment, if he delivers a crate of mangoes to Dayal Babu's house. Unknown to Makkhi, there is a bomb inside the crate, which explodes after he leaves, killing Dayal Babu. Chedi gives Makkhi a task to kill Chulbul. Makkhi accepts, and confesses it to Chulbul. He reveals to Chulbul that Chedi made him plant the bomb unknowingly. Chulbul forgives him and reconciles with his stepfather. Makkhi then reveals to Chulbul that it was Chedi, who killed their mother. Enraged, Chulbul suffocates Chedi to death. Later, Chulbul gets Makkhi married to Nirmala in the presence of her father, while Rajjo reveals that she is pregnant. Credits were adapted from Bollywood Hungama. Salman Khan grew a moustache after consulting with his brother and prepared his hair to suit his role. For the former, he had to try out nearly fifty styles in a span of four months before commencement of the filming. Photo-shoots were held to finalise his look. Abhinav Kashyap, in an interview with Bollywood Hungama, revealed that initially he had considered a few others for the role of Chulbul Pandey, but eventually changed his mind and approached Salman. Kashyap had seen Arbaaz in Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na, doing a cameo and approached him to be a part of the project. After reading it, he had instantly accepted to produce and star in it. Sonu Sood was selected for playing the lead antagonist. He revealed that his character was that of a \"youth leader with grey shades.\" Mahesh Manjrekar was later approached to play the father of Sinha's character, although he had plans to quit acting. In April 2009, Sonakshi Sinha signed for her debut role. Salman had seen her at a function engaging in dancing and offered her the role. Speaking about it, she said that she had lost a weight of 30\u00a0kg over two years to prepare for her character of a village girl by \"a combination of proper diet and vigorous exercise\". She added that she had been \"observing people and trying to pick up nuances\" as a step of further preparation. Malaika Arora, who had performed a few item numbers in her career, most notably in Dil Se.., was confirmed to do the same in the film. This was the first of its kind in her home production. Dabangg's shooting took place primarily in Wai and the United Arab Emirates. The shooting commenced in September 2009. Production designer Wasiq Khan drew over 100 sketches detailing out every set in the film. The cinematography was performed by Mahesh Limaye. The first schedule began in the town of Wai and continued for 45 days, during which Sonu Sood, the main antagonist fractured his nose. A schedule, primarily involving a song shoot, was captured in the Khalid Bin Al Waheed station in Dubai, making Dabangg the first film to be shot there. Some scenes were also filmed at the Emirates Palace hotel in Abu Dhabi. The film, involving around five action sequences, was choreographed by S. Vijayan, who previously served as the stunt director of Wanted, and shot over 60 days. Later, special effects were incorporated into those scenes. The songs were choreographed by Raju Khan and Shabina Khan, while Farah Khan choreographed the item number, \"Munni Badnaam Hui\". The shooting was completed in early June 2010, and the film went into post-production. A party was held to commemorate the completion of the shooting and the success of the theatrical promo. It was attended by the main cast and crew. Dabangg's theatrical trailer, running for about two and a half minutes, was released on 23 July 2010, alongside Priyadarshan\u2019s Khatta Meetha. Dabangg was described as one of the most anticipated films of the year by the The Indian Express. It was reported to have broken pre-release records for hype by Cinematix, a filming awareness product originated by Ormax Media. A special screening of the film took place at Film City on 6 September 2010. The premiere of Dabangg was held in Mumbai on 9 September 2010. The soundtrack album was composed by the music director duo Sajid-Wajid and Lalit Pandit, while the lyrics were penned by Faiz Anwar, Lalit Pandit and Jalees Sherwani. Lalit Pandit wrote the song \"Munni Badnaam Hui\". The album was launched on 6 August 2010 in Delhi. The album contains five original songs, four remixes and one theme song. The audio rights of Dabangg were sold for about \u20b990 million (US$1.4\u00a0million) to T-Series. The track \"Munni Badnaam Hui\" is said to be inspired by an old Bhojpuri folk song \"Launda Badnaam Hua Naseeban Tere Liye\". Director Abhinav Kashyap accepted using the folk song saying that he, being from Uttar Pradesh, was familiar with the song since childhood so he suggested the very song to be improvised and rephrased to fit the film's requirement. It was alleged that it was inspired from the Pakistani song \"Ladka Badnaam Hua\" from the film Mr. Charlie (1992). Dabangg's soundtrack received generally positive reviews from music critics. Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gave the album 3 stars and said, \"[it] delivers what it promised. One expected a masala soundtrack and this is what one gets with a couple of item song sequences, a couple of theme tracks and two love songs which are actually the highlight of the film. A soundtrack that has something in store for mass as well as class.\" Atta Khan of Planet Bollywood gave it a rating of 6 out of 10, and called the soundtrack \"simple, catchy, easy on the ears and fun\". In a 3-star rating, critic Devesh Sharma of Filmfare praised Sajid-Wajid's composition, and the track \"Chori Kiya Re Jiya\", calling it \"[pleasure] to the ears\". The album performed well on the charts after its release. The tracks \"Tere Mast Mast Do Nain\" and \"Munni Badnaam\" were successful, and entered the list of top 20 most frequently played songs on radio in India. In August 2010, the track \"Tere Mast Mast Do Nain\" reached number-one on the Official Asian Download Chart in the United Kingdom based on legal downloads in that country. Track list Dabangg released worldwide on 10 September 2010. It opened up across 1,800 screens in India and around 300 screens overseas. The film was released in 2300 theatres worldwide. It was also screened in Norway at an international film festival. The film's DVDs and VCDs were launched by the Reliance Big Home Video on 12 October 2010. It was released on YouTube on 28 January 2011 for free viewing to audiences in India. The satellite rights were pre-sold for \u20b9100 million (US$1.5\u00a0million) to Colors. \"For anybody who wants to know what is the on-screen definition of Bollywood, Dabangg is truly text book fare. It's loud, crazy, zany, exaggerated, larger-than-life, almost nonsensical, totally make-believe, comic book like, complete kitsch, generously peppered with the mandatory desi tadka (garnishing) of songs and dances that keep popping out of nowhere and is literally oozing with star charisma.\" The film generally received positive reviews from critics, most of whom praised the performance of Salman Khan. In a 4-star review for Koimoi, Komal Nahta ensured that the film would be a commercial success. Kaveree Bamzai of India Today gave the film four stars while labelling it as \"one Zandu Balm of a movie.\" Film critic Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis called the film \"slightly mad, and terribly entertaining.\" Mathures Paul of The Statesman gave the film 3.5 stars and commented, \"Dabangg aligns itself with viewers frustrated by the nonexistence of uncomplicated heroism on screen.\" In a 3-star review for Rediff.com, Abhishek Mande stated \"Dabangg is not a movie for non-Salman fans. But for those who worship him it's a film you simply cannot afford to miss.\" Anupama Chopra of NDTV and Sukanya Venkatgarhavan of Filmfare gave it 3 stars, and both praised Khan's performance. Gaurav Malani of Indiatimes was critical towards the film's story, remarking \"the film doesn\u2019t care a damn for coming up with any innovative storyline.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN panned the film's screenplay, but praised Khan's performance. Shobhaa De of the Bangalore Times was critical, concluding \"Let\u2019s hand it to Salman who has pulled off the stunts and pelvic thrusts. Nothing new there. But it is the naughty self-parodying, which is so camp, so out there, which delivers the biggest punch. What\u2019s left for this guy now\u00a0\u2013 all he needs is a cape. And he can call himself Superman.\" \"Munni Badnaam Hui\" included a brand name 'Zandu Balm' in its lyrics, much to the displeasure of Emami\u2014the makers of the brand. A trademark case was settled by the producers and Emami out of court, and Malaika Arora was later chosen to an official advertising campaign promoting Zandu Balm. Activist Rajkumar Tak filed a case in the Bombay High Court, demanding that the deletion of the word \"Hindustan\" from the song, claiming that the censor board had not responded to his queries in regard to the \"defaming\" lyrics. He found them \"highly objectionable\" and \"unpardonable\" and labelled the song a \"mockery\" for the country, as a girl was \"indecently\" dancing in the presence of corrupted officers, which, according to him, threw bad light on the nation and \"hurt the patriotic sentiments of every Indian\". Before release, critic and writer Shobhaa De called for a boycott of Dabangg, due to Salman's comments on the 2008 Mumbai attacks. She criticised it as \"arrogance, ignorance and plain stupidity.\" This sparked off a fight with the producers via Twitter, and continued after her negative review of the film. Anurag Kashyap, brother of Abhinav Kashyap, tweeted \"Salman khan thinks he made my brother's life.. Hope he can do the same for his brother Arbaaz with Dabangg 2.\" This was taken as \"slamming\" Salman and resulted in Arbaaz retorting back by referring to the comment as \"attitude\" instead of \"gratitude\". However, Anurag later apologised for his remarks, which Arbaaz accepted. Dabangg received accolades in major film award functions in India. Among them, it won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. It was given six awards at the 56th Filmfare Awards, including one for Best Film, seven Screen Awards, nine Zee Cine Awards, and ten IIFA Awards.

It strengthened his Bollywood he-man image. His dialogue in the film \"Tarikh pe tarikh\" became iconic and a pop-culture reference. The film was a milestone in the careers of Meenakshi Sheshadri, Sunny Deol and Amrish Puri who gave some great hits like Ghayal and Ghatak: Lethal together. Aamir Khan acted in a special appearance in the stage show dance song. Damini \u2013 Lightning was remade into Oriya as Nari Nuhne Tu Narayani starring Sidhanta Mohapatra and Rachana Banarjee. It was remade into Tamil as Priyanka starring Revathi as the title character. Box Office India declared the film a Hit. This film was remade in Bangladesh as Sottyer Bijoy starring Manna (actor) Moushumi directed by FI Manik. The rights of the movie are now owned by Shah Rukh Khan's Red Chillies Entertainment.   Shekhar Gupta (Rishi Kapoor), a rich businessman, falls in love at first sight with Damini (Meenakshi Sheshadri). They get married and Damini moves into his luxurious bungalow. One day, she witnesses Shekhar's younger brother, Rakesh (Ashwin Kaushal), raping the maid-servant Urmi (Prajakta) and rushes to tell Shekhar.

Film reviewer, Pranay Bhagat, wrote \"If there is one modern film which signifies the importance of truth it has to be Damini. Though the movie is more remembered for the dialogues of Sunny Deol and his confrontational scenes with Amrish Puri, I feel the movie should also be appreciated for a tight bound script, the wonderfully directed courtroom scenes, good background music as well as a career best performance from Meenakshi.\" \"Damini without doubt has to be one of the top drama's produced in 90's Bollywood, great direction, great cast and a great story. The film also deals with multiple issues such as the lengths people would go to protect their honour, maniplulative/exploitative media, corrupt cops and the politics of rape.... A wonderful film on being true to yourself and doing the right thing, all delivered in a non preachy manner\" writes another reviewer.

        "full_text": " Dangal (English: Wrestling competition) is a 2016 Indian Hindi-language biographical sports drama film directed by Nitesh Tiwari. It stars Aamir Khan as Mahavir Singh Phogat, who taught wrestling to his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari. The former is India's first female wrestler to win at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, where she won the gold medal (55\u00a0kg). Her sister Babita Kumari won the silver (51\u00a0kg). The music for Dangal was composed by Pritam, while the lyrics were written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. Kripa Shankar Bishnoi, a coach with the Indian women's wrestling team, trained Aamir Khan and the entire crew for the wrestling sequences. Released worldwide on 23 December 2016, Dangal was declared tax-free in six Indian states \u2013 Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh \u2013 to promote Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, a Government of India's social campaign aiming to reduce the selective abortion of females, to protect girls, and to educate them. Dangal was also released in Tamil and Telugu dubbed versions. At the 62nd Filmfare Awards, Dangal won four awards, including Best Film, Best Director (Tiwari), Best Action (Shyam) and Best Actor (Khan). Dangal emerged as the highest grossing Hindi film domestically, and second-highest grossing Indian film of all time with a worldwide gross of \u20b97.3 billion (US$110\u00a0million).   Mahavir Singh Phogat is an amateur wrestler who was forced to give up wrestling in order to obtain gainful employment. He was unable to win a gold medal for India and vows that his son will. He is disappointed when his wife gives birth to four daughters. He gives up his dream thinking that girls cannot wrestle and should only be taught household chores. But when his older daughters, Geeta and Babita, come home after beating up two boys in response to derogatory comments, Mahavir Singh realises his daughters have the potential to become wrestlers. Mahavir begins coaching Geeta and Babita in wrestling. His methods seem harsh, including grueling early morning workouts and short haircuts to avoid lice. Initially, the girls resent their father for his treatment but they soon realise that their father wants them to have a future and not grow up to be stereotypical housewives. The girls become motivated and willingly participate in Mahavir's coaching. Mahavir takes the girls to wrestling tournaments. Geeta and Babita wrestle boys and defeat them, much to everyone's utter surprise. Geeta eventually wins the Junior Nationals and goes to an institute in Patiala for further training so that she can participate in the Commonwealth Games. Geeta makes friends at the institute and begins to disregard the rigour and discipline she has been brought up with. She regularly watches TV, eats street food, and grows her hair longer. Her coach's training differs significantly from her father's techniques. Geeta believes her coach's techniques are better and that Mahavir's techniques are outdated. On a visit home, she is determined to show her father she can wrestle well without his techniques. This leads to a ferocious bout between Geeta and Mahavir. Mahavir loses against Geeta due to his age. Babita tells Geeta that she shouldn't forget her father's techniques and reminds her that it is because of their father that she is where she is now. Babita soon follows Geeta to the institute. Geeta finds herself losing every match as she wasn't following her father's techniques and had lost the singular focus she initially had (painting her nails and growing her hair long). Realising her error, and coaxed by Babita, Geeta tearfully makes peace with her father. Mahavir comes to Patiala with the girls' cousin (their former sparring partner) and begins coaching Geeta and Babita secretly, using the same methods as when they were younger. Their coach comes to know about this and is furious with Mahavir's interference and wants to expel them both from the institution, but a deal is struck to allow them to continue as long as Mahavir does not enter the institution or train them elsewhere. Determined to continue assisting his daughters, Mahavir obtains tapes of Geeta's previous unsuccessful bouts and coaches her by pointing out her errors over the phone. During Geeta's bouts in the Commonwealth Games, Mahavir constantly contradicts her coach's instructions while sitting in the audience. Geeta disregards her coach and follows her father's instructions and wins every bout. Just before the final bout, Geeta's jealous coach conspires to lock Mahavir in a closet far away from the arena. Due to her father's absence, Geeta starts lagging behind in the bout where she manages to win the first round but loses the second. It's the final round and the score is 4-1 where Geeta is down. In the final seconds of the round, Geeta becomes desperate to win points but loses another instead. Now, the score is 5-1. Only a quarter of the final minute is left, and now, Geeta starts recalling her father's teachings. She recalls her father talking about a 5-pointer suplex back manoeuvre when she was young. Mahavir said that the suplex is difficult but can be applied. She also recalls her father saying that one has to play with the opponent's mind. Mahavir said that one has to show something and do something else. Combining these two teachings, Geeta executes a suplex on her opponent in the final 3 seconds, leading to a score of 6-5 (Geeta being up) and becomes the first Indian female wrestler to win gold. Mahavir returns just in time to embrace his daughters, frustrating the coach's hopes of obtaining credit before the news media. The end credits reveal that Babita also won a silver medal in wrestling at the Commonwealth Games in 2014, Geeta became the first Indian female wrestler to qualify for the Olympics and Mahavir's efforts inspired dozens of Indian women to participate in wrestling. In 2012 Divya Rao, a member of Disney's creative team, read an article in a newspaper about Mahavir Singh Phogat, who trained his daughters to become world class champions. She thought this would make for a great film, and spoke about this to Siddharth Roy Kapur and other Disney personnel. Disney approached Nitesh Tiwari to write and direct the story. Tiwari met Mahavir Singh Phogat and his daughters, who instantly agreed to tell the story. In 2013 Siddharth Roy Kapur and Nitesh Tiwari went to Aamir Khan with the story, and Khan loved it in its first narration. Khan had just finished Dhoom 3 and started shooting for PK. Khan wanted to do the film after 5\u201310 years when he would be turning 60, because the script of the film demanded Khan to be 55 years old and he was still doing younger roles. But somewhere the story remained in his mind. After a few months he called up Nitesh Tiwari and asked him to narrate the script once again. In 2014, after the release of PK, Aamir Khan announced that he would play the role of a wrestler in his next film titled Dangal directed by Nitesh Tiwari, a cinematographic biography of the former wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat. It would be produced by Khan himself and Disney's India. Khan said to reporters, \"Nitesh has written a wonderful story. The topic is very important, it's very dramatic. It highlights the discrimination that is meted out to the girl child in India. The best part is that he has done it in a very entertaining manner. The heart of the story is emotional, but it also has a lot of humour. Raju Hirani has this unique way to tell a story where he says something socially very relevant but he tells his story in a very entertaining manner. Similarly Nitesh has written a very entertaining lovely script, the dialogues are very entertaining. Each time I listen to the dialogues, I laugh a lot. I cry as well as laugh.\" In March 2015, Junior Indian women's wrestling team coach Kripa Shankar Patel Bishnoi was approached by Aamir Khan Productions to train Khan and the entire crew of Dangal. Bishnoi said about the film in a Hindustan Times interview, \"Very few Indians encourage women for wrestling, especially because of the uniform. This film will change that perception too. People would hopefully want to see their daughters taking up wrestling as a sport.\" Khan lost some weight and took Haryanvi lessons and dialect training for the film. He played two distinct roles in the film: the 60-year-old wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat, and the 20-year-old version of Phogat. Khan reportedly gained 30\u00a0kg and weighs 98\u00a0kg to play the role of the older Phogat, then lost the weight to play the younger role in Dangal. In March 2015 Taapsee Pannu, Deeksha Seth and Akshara Haasan were being considered for the roles of Khan's on-screen daughters. In April 2015, Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra were cast as the daughters, who hailed from the Jat community of Balali village of Bhiwani, Haryana. Geeta Phogat had participated in the London Olympics in 2012. Babita won gold in 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. In June 2015, child actors Zaira Wasim (from Kashmir) and Suhani Bhatnagar (from Delhi) were roped in for Dangal. Ayushmann Khurrana's brother Aparshakti Khurrana was also cast. Mukesh Chhabra was the casting director of Dangal. Vikram Singh was recruited to play the role of the villain. Aamir Khan's nephew Pablo (son of Mansoor Khan) was the film's assistant director. Mallika Sherawat auditioned for a role. In August 2015, Rajkumar Rao, who previously worked with Aamir Khan in Talaash, was approached for an important role in Dangal. Finally, after auditioning 70 actresses for the role, Sakshi Tanwar was brought on as Daya Kaur, the wife of Mahavir Singh Phogat. Ananya was chosen to play Sangita, the youngest daughter of Mahavir Phogat. In October 2015, Vivan Bhatena was selected to play a negative role in the film. In an interview in January 2017, Divya Rao stated, if Aamir Khan have declined the role, the only other choices would have been Mohanlal and Kamal Haasan. The shooting schedule of Dangal began on 1 September 2015. The villages of Ludhiana were given a Haryanvi transformation. The shooting took place in the villages of Gujjarwal, Narangwal, Kila Raipur, Dango and Leel in Punjab and Haryana. Interestingly, the village of Dango, which is in the Pakhowal Tehsil in Ludhiana, is veteran actor Dharmendra's ancestral village. From September 2015 to December 2015, Aamir Khan gained 9% fat, weighing around 98\u00a0kg for Dangal, and from January 2016 to April 2016, he regained the shape that he had opted for in Dhoom 3 and will hear the script for next future films, halting shooting of Dangal for said period. The first scene was taken on 21 September 2015 in Ludhiana with the presences of Mahavir Singh Phogat and his both daughters Geeta Phogat, Babita Kumari. On 14 November 2015, while shooting in Ludhiana, Khan suffered minor injuries resulting in muscle spasms in his back.[relevant? \u2013 discuss] On November 20, 2015, Khan collapsed after sustaining a shoulder injury on the set. After suffering an injury Aamir Khan resumes shooting in Pune on 9 December 2015. The team filmed in and around stadiums at the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex in Pune. At the time, the complex hosted the 2015 Roll Ball World Cup, and athletes of the Netherlands national rollball team and Slovenia women's national roll ball team were recruited to play background athletes in the film. The team also shot some portions of the film in Symbiosis International University, Pune. On 19 January 2016, Khan and the entire crew of the film shot in Delhi, at Talkatora Stadium, to film wrestling sequences. The crew then moved to Thyagaraj Stadium to shoot sequences of Commonwealth Games and National Games. The first schedule of shooting was also done in schools and in Dango village, located in Pakhowal Tehsil in Ludhiana. The second schedule of the film started on 16 June 2016 at the Akhada Leel near Toosa village, in Ludhiana district. It is one of the largest villages in Punjab, India. Khan said, \"When I came to Ludhiana, I was very fat. At that time, we shot for the scenes where Mahavir has become old. 85 per cent of the film is about his 'old' look only. Now we are shooting for the portion when Mahavir was young.\" Dangal was released in the United States on 21 December 2016 and worldwide on 23 December 2016. The film was shown on an estimated 4300 screens in India and 1000 screens internationally. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that the film holds an 83% approval rating, based on 6 reviews, with an average score of 7.3/10. Meena Iyer of The Times of India rated 4.5/5 stars, saying \"The film is bound to inspire more women to seriously consider kushti as a sport.\" Iyer further said that the film has \"an earthy soundtrack\". Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times rated 4/5 stars, saying, \"This could be Aamir (Khan)'s best performance till date.\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated 3/5 stars, saying \"That was crucial for us to believe in this film, which borrows several elements from the real-life.\" Gupta added, \"It could have been made more polished than required.\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV rated 4/5 stars, saying \"a hugely entertaining sporting saga that works simply as a piece of good old storytelling\". Ananya Bhattacharya of India Today rated 4/5 stars, saying \"Dangal is a crowd pleaser. It has stellar performances and an engaging story-telling.\" She added, \"Music is used as a narrating device, and the songs don't affect the pace.\" Rohit Bhatnagar of Deccan Chronicle awarded full 5 stars, saying \"Dangal is the best feast on this Christmas and one can't deny that the film is the best one of 2016.\" Raja Sen and Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com respectively rated 4.5/5 and 4/5 stars, saying \"Dangal teaches us where rainbows lie in wrestling. Watch this film for the way it puts the 'her' in 'hero.'\" and \"Tiwari invests a great deal of time and energy in telling the magnificent real-life tale of the Phogats.\" Aniruddha Guha of MensXP.com awarded 4/5 stars, and praised the filmcraft of the wrestling scenes in particular. \"The wrestling matches are beautifully choreographed and shot\". 'Dangal' has moments of greatness and the aura of a classic, even though its lofty ambitions aren't always matched with the consistency demanded from a true epic. Yet, there's enough craftiness packed in its 160-minute runtime to win you over.\u00a0 Missing or empty |url= (help) Mike McCahill of The Guardian rated 3/5 stars and said, \"very solid, very sound entertainment, with thumpingly good songs\". Ben Kenigsberg of The New York Times commented that the film is formulaic as sports films go, but that \"the movie benefits from the amount of time it devotes to wrestling strategy.\" Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in in giving her verdict on the film says that, \"Dangal is a chronicle of the industriousness, perseverance and personal sacrifice that produce sporting champions, but it is above all a tribute to obsession\". Every age produces the cinema it deserves, and with its insistence on absolute obedience to an authoritarian figure, Dangal is inadvertently a reflection of our times. Daddy truly does know best, and Dangal harbours no doubt whatsoever that his daughters are wise not to question him.\u00a0 Missing or empty |url= (help) Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu noted in his personal blog that \"Aamir is essentially playing an anti-hero, a madman.\". It's strange that a man who recognises the unfairness of not being granted leave to train his daughter is unable to see that he's doing what other men around him are doing \u2013 he's \"marrying his daughter off,\" at a very young age, to a sport. Aamir brings out these contradictions beautifully \u2013 this is one of his finest performances.\u00a0 Missing or empty |url= (help) Azad Essa, a journalist with Al Jazeera South Africa and co-founder of The Daily Vox observed that \"Given the influence of Bollywood to tweak with the national imagination, the film is set to stir a national discussion in India.\". The elevation of women is still a manifestation of an unfulfilled male dream. It is the male coach who emerges as the true hero, and not the women.\u00a0 Missing or empty |url= (help) Tanul Thakur of TheWire.in praises the movie for a brilliant first half, that, \"Dangal cares about the world it's set in, achieving much by trying little\". Mahavir training her daughters \u2013 are more about how life is lived, as opposed to how it should be, how one lack of choice can be better than the other. There's very little sermonising here, and as a result, the first half of Dangal with its sharp writing, impressive acting, smart editing and cinematography, makes for a satisfying watch.\u00a0 Missing or empty |url= (help) but he also criticises the movie for a repetitive and bloated second half. \"The film then devotes a substantial amount of runtime in showing how Mahavir was right all along\". Dangal's fixated on convincing us that Mahavir can never be wrong, that the problem is always with Geeta. It's a strange implication, underscored in scene after scene, that Geeta is nothing without her father, a man.\u00a0 Missing or empty |url= (help) Dangal became the 2nd Indian film to cross the \u20b97 billion (US$110\u00a0million) mark after PK. Dangal is second Indian film to gross more than Rs 2\u00a0billion in overseas markets, after PK grossed US$46.52\u00a0million (Rs 2.94\u00a0billion). The film collected \u20b9298 million (US$4.6\u00a0million) on its opening day which is recorded as the second highest non-holiday opening after Dhoom 3. On its second day, the film collected \u20b9348 million (US$5.4\u00a0million) and on the third day collections were \u20b9424 million (US$6.6\u00a0million) taking the first weekend collections to \u20b91.07 billion (US$17\u00a0million). On 9 January 2017, Dangal became the highest grossing Indian film domestically, beating Aamir Khan's previous film PK. Having grossed approximately US$11.46\u00a0million (Rs. 780.7\u00a0million) at the North America box office, the Gulf box office crossed \u20b9563 million (US$8.7\u00a0million).In Australia, Dangal has collected $1.86\u00a0million (Rs.126.5\u00a0million) till date and has emerged as the All Time Highest Grosser in the region. At the U.K box office, the movie has grossed $3.93\u00a0million (267.4\u00a0million). At the New Zealand box office, the movie has collected \u20b929.8 million (US$460,000) and has emerged as the highest-grossing film in the region. Dangal collected $29.43\u00a0million (Rs 2006.5\u00a0million) from total overseas sources. While the core of the movie\u2019s story holds true to the real life events of Mahavir Singh Phogat, director Nitesh Tiwari allowed himself a few cinematic liberties to make plot more dramatic. Following are a few facts shown in Dangal that differ from what happened in the real life of the Phogats. The film's music is composed by Pritam. Lyrics are penned by Amitabh Bhattacharya in Hindi, and Rajesh Malaravannan in Tamil. It was reported that Daler Mehndi has sung a song in the movie.",

        "full_text": " Dear Zindagi (English: Dear Life) is a 2016 Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age drama film written and directed by Gauri Shinde. It was produced by Gauri Khan, Karan Johar, and Shinde under the banners of Red Chillies Entertainment, Dharma Productions, and Hope Productions respectively. The film features Alia Bhatt in the lead role, with Shah Rukh Khan, Kunal Kapoor and Ali Zafar in supporting roles. The plot centers on a budding cinematographer named Kaira, who is discontented with her life and meets Dr. Jehangir, a free-spirited psychologist who helps her to gain a new perspective on her life. The film's development began in 2015, when Shinde signed Bhatt and Shah Rukh Khan for a film to be made under her banner. Principal photography took place in Goa and Mumbai. The film features a score composed by Amit Trivedi and lyrics written mostly by Kausar Munir. Dear Zindagi released on 23 November 2016 in North America, two days before its worldwide release on 25 November 2016, to commercial success and generally positive reviews, with major praise directed to Bhatt's and Khan's performances.   The film is set in Mumbai and Goa. Kaira is a promising cinematographer who wishes to direct her own films. Blunt and cynical, she is most comfortable when with her three best friends, Fatima, Jackie and Ganju. Kaira's life takes a downturn when Raghuvendra, a film producer for whom she breaks up with her childhood sweetheart, gets engaged to someone else. Her landlord turns her out of her apartment because the building association wants to rent apartments only to married couples. All this plus dissatisfaction with her prospects at work serves as a catalyst for her shift to Goa, where she now has to grudgingly live with her parents with whom she has some issues. She ends up spending many sleepless nights in unhappiness and uncertainty. While in Goa, she seeks out Dr. Jehangir \"Jug\" Khan, a psychologist, for her insomnia, after inadvertently having heard him talk at a Mental Health Awareness Conference. She warms to Jug's unconventional methods, trying to use them to understand herself. Meanwhile, she meets a musician, Rumi, and she falls in love with him, but they break up before anything serious can happen when she realizes they may not be the right fit for each other. She also reunites with her younger brother, Kiddo, who is the only other person besides her best friends that she is closest to. Matters with her family come to a head when Kaira has an outburst at a family get-together where she confronts her parents about them abandoning her for years at her grandparents' house. She finally narrates the story of her abandonment to Jug, who tells her that she fears abandonment so much that she doesn't allow herself to commit in relationships, leaving before they can leave her. He convinces her that she doesn't need to forgive her parents for abandoning her, but she can, as an adult, see them as two regular people who made a mistake. After this, Kaira makes an effort to reconcile with her parents and also works to finish her short film. At their last session, Kaira admits to Jug that she has grown to like him. Jug responds that it is normal for a patient to feel this way about his/her therapist and while he likes her too, she is still his patient and he, her psychologist, and a relationship would not be possible. The two share a hug before Kaira leaves. The movie ends with a viewing of Kaira's short film and a beach sequence thereafter which signifies she has learnt to love life and has matured post her therapy. Made on a moderate budget, Dear Zindagi was produced by Gauri Khan of Red Chillies Entertainment, Johar of Dharma Productions and Shinde of Hope Productions. The film was directed by Shinde, her second directorial after the comedy-drama film English Vinglish (2012). In August 2015, Shinde revealed that she had \"almost\" completed working on the script of the film. Pre-production work began in December 2015, when the film was picked up for the production. Shinde started working in the story for the film. She decided to set the story of the film in Goa and Mumbai. The editing for the film was headed by Hemanti Sarkar. The dialog team consisted of Krishna Hariharan, Gauri Shinde and Kausar Munir. Laxman Utekar was the cinematographer of the film, and Rupin Suchak was the film's production designer. India Today reported that Shah Rukh Khan and Bhatt would star together in Shinde's then-untitled film. Bhatt was very eager to work with Shah Rukh Khan. It is Shah Rukh Khan's first film with Bhatt. It was reported that there would not be any typical romance between the characters of Shah Rukh Khan and Bhatt. Shinde confirmed to The Indian Express saying, \"It won't be as typical as one expects man and woman to be together.\" In April 2016, it was reported that Shah Rukh Khan would play a love guru who would help Bhatt's character to manage the attention of four people and figure out how to find her true love, and Bhatt would play the role of a filmmaker, whose experiences with all four characters would shape her life and work. The other actors who were signed up for the film include Ali Zafar, who played the role of rockstar and musician; Angad Bedi, who played the role of Kaira's childhood sweetheart, a restobar owner; Kunal Kapoor, who played the role of Kaira's film producer and invested in Bhatt's film; and Aditya Roy Kapur, who played the role of a charming furniture dealer. Ira Dubey and Yashaswini Dayama played the role of Kaira's best friends, while Rohit Saraf played the role of her brother. Principal photographing for Dear Zindagi began on 21 January 2016 in Goa.

Mayank Shekhar of Mid Day also gave the film 3 stars, saying \"This film, at its core, is conversational sort of feature, but mostly quiet, even indoorsy.\" Rohit Bhatnagar of Deccan Chronicle gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, saying \"The makers cleverly create a hype for the film by teasing the audiences with the film's best parts. Dear Zindagi should be blamed for its loose execution that it doesn't touch you.\" Bollywood Hungama also rated 2.5 out of 5 stars to the film and commented that it was \"a slow-paced cerebral and contemporary slice of life tale about the challenges today's generation of girls face in a rapidly shifting landscape\". Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times rated the film 2 out of 5 stars, saying, \"If only [the director] brought better-etched characters and delved more into the emotional turmoils of her lead, this could have been a wonderful 'slice-of-life' film with several messages to be lauded for.\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film only 1.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Dear Zindagi should have been a much better film. What we get instead, in spades, is bumper-sticker self-help notes which are strictly boiler-plate.\" Christine Iyer of The National awarded the film 4 out of 5 stars and praised Shah Rukh Khan by saying \"he absolutely shines in the role of soft-spoken therapist Jehangir \"Jug\" Khan in this gentle drama by Gauri Shinde\". Manjusha Radhakrishnan of Gulf News rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and commented, \"If you are looking for a heartwarming, sensitive film about troubled twenty-somethings, then make a date with Dear Zindagi.\" Anisha Jhaveri of IndieWire gave the film a grade of A minus, and said its plot had a \"powerful message, that gives Dear Zindagi its substance\". Shilpa Jamkhandikar of Reuters stated that \"The need to explain every moment and articulate every emotion pulls down Dear Zindagi; even the brilliant chemistry between the two leads cannot salvage the film from this fatal flaw\". Andy Webster of The New York Times stated that \"There are sentimental threads here, but Shinde's insightful movie is a resounding victory.\" In the first week of November 2016, it was reported that Ali Zafar has been replaced by Tahir Raj Bhasin in the film due to the tensions created after the 2016 Uri terror attack and the subsequent ban on Pakistani actors by the MNS. However, on 15 November 2016, Pakistan's newspaper Dawn reported that Bhatt denied the rumours at an event on 14 November 2016. On being asked, she said: \"Nobody is being replaced. The film will release in its full form.\" Ali Zafar has sung two songs for the film, but those were dubbed by Arijit Singh, whose versions were added into the soundtrack album instead of Zafar's. Later, Zafar's songs were officially shared online. Shortly after the release of the film, Temple Street Productions sent a legal notice to Karan Johar's Dharma Productions for copyright infringement, alleging that the movie was inspired in detail by the Canadian television series Being Erica. Shinde has denied the claim. The soundtrack was released by Sony Music India. The full album was released on 15 November 2016. Audio Jukebox was released on 21 November 2016 on YouTube. The song \"Ae Zindagi Gale Laga Le\" for 1983 film Sadma written by Gulzar, and was originally composed by Ilaiyaraaja, and it was sung by Suresh Wadkar, has been recreated for the film. While, lyrics for the other songs in the album are written by Kausar Munir. All music composed by Amit Trivedi. Suanshu Khurana and A. Kameshwari of The Indian Express praised the music and respectively said, \"A fresh and enthusiastic set, with life's tales told in a breezy fashion. The album lacks variance, yet, it manages to have many sparkling moments.\" and, \"Sensible and relatable songs making the album simplistic that automatically gets registered at the back of your mind, a poetic version of our exact feelings.\" Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama, rating the music album a 3 out of 5 stars, said that it was \"a series of situational songs that should sound good in the film's narrative\". Rinky Kumar of The Times of India rated 3 stars to the album, saying, \"this movie doesn't have songs that have a high recall value\".",

A story of unfulfilled love, when hero's childhood love is separated from him due to class inequalities. It is one of noted tragedies made in early Hindi cinema. It became a popular film of the Golden era and further established Dilip Kumar as \"King of Tragedy\". Many years later, when Deedar was having a rerun at Mumbai theatres, actor Manoj Kumar, who asked director Raj Khosla to accompany him for a show. Thereafter, the story of Do Badan (1966) was written after reworking its storyline, the film was also a hit. It is referred to repeatedly in the Vikram Seth's 1993 novel A Suitable Boy, in which people watching it burst into tears and people who can't get tickets start a riot. The film was remade in Tamil as Neengatha Ninaivu (1963).   The Soundtrack was composed by the legend Naushad with lyrics by Shakeel Badayuni.

        "full_text": " Deewaar (The Wall) is a 1975 Indian crime-drama film directed by Yash Chopra, written by Salim-Javed, and starring Amitabh Bachchan and Shashi Kapoor. Reflecting \"the tumultuous politics of the early 70s\" in India, Deewaar tells the story of a pair of impoverished brothers who, after their family is betrayed by the misplaced idealism of their father, struggle to survive on the streets of Mumbai. Deewaar was a ground-breaking work. It was one of a slew of films establishing Bachchan as the \"angry young man\" of Bollywood cinema and Parveen Babi as the \"new Bollywood woman\" whose character Anita is \"a liberated working girl, smoking, drinking and making love to her partner, defying every Hindi film heroine rule.\" The movie cemented the success of the writing duo Salim-Javed, who went on to write many more blockbuster films. It is said that after the success of this film, the value of film writers skyrocketed thanks to Salim-Javed, and they soon were being paid as highly as some actors at the time. The Deewaar in question refers to the wall that has sprung up between the two brothers, drawn apart by fate and circumstance in a time of socio-political turmoil. Deewaar received the Filmfare Best Movie Award of 1975 in addition to six other Filmfare Awards and was a \"superhit\" at the box office, ranking as the 4th highest grossing Bollywood film of 1975. Indiatimes ranks Deewaar amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films. The film was later remade in Telugu as Magaadu (1976), in Tamil as Thee (1981) and in Malayalam as Nathi Muthal Nathi Vare (1983).   The film opens with a depiction of the strong leadership of trade unionist Anand Verma (Satyen Kappu), who works hard to enhance the lives of struggling laborers. He lives in a modest home with his wife, Sumitra Devi (Nirupa Roy), and their two young sons, Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) loosely based on Haji Mastan, and Ravi (Shashi Kapoor). Anand, however, is blackmailed by a corrupt businessman who threatens to kill his family if Anand does not cease his protest activities. Forced into compliance, Anand is thus attacked by the very same laborers who then jeer him for his betrayal, unaware that he was blackmailed. His family is also persecuted by the angry workers. Out of shame, Anand leaves town, leaving Sumitra to care for their sons alone in poverty. Several of the angry workers kidnap Vijay and tattoo his arm with the Hindi words \"\u092e\u0947\u0930\u093e \u092c\u093e\u092a \u091a\u094b\u0930 \u0939\u0948\" (translated into \"My Father Is A Thief\"). Not knowing what else to do, Sumitra brings her children to Mumbai and struggles as a day laborer to care for her now homeless sons. Vijay, the older brother, grows up with an acute awareness of his father's failure and is victimized for his father's supposed misdeeds. In the process of fighting for his rights, Vijay, who starts out as a boot polisher, was a dockyard worker in his youth, now becomes a smuggler for the underworld. Vijay beats up several thugs working for their ruthless leader Samant (Madan Puri), which then influences one of Samant's rivals to bring Vijay to his inner circle, leaving Vijay to become a new leading figure of the underworld. He also sacrifices his own education so his brother Ravi can study. Ravi is an excellent student. He is dating Veera (Neetu Singh), the daughter of a senior police officer. On the Commissioner's suggestion, Ravi applies for employment with the police, and is sent for training. Several months later, he is accepted by the police, and has a rank of Sub-Inspector. When Ravi returns home, he finds that Vijay has become a businessman overnight, has accumulated wealth, and a palatial home. One of his first assignments is to apprehend and arrest some of Bombay's hardcore criminals and smugglers which includes his brother, Vijay \u2013 much to his shock, as he had never associated his own brother with criminal activities. Ravi must now decide between apprehending Vijay and quitting the police force. When Ravi finds out that Vijay has acquired wealth by crime, he decides to move out along with his mother. Shouldering past the loss of his mother and sibling, Vijay enters a sexual relationship with Anita (Parveen Babi), a woman whom he meets at a bar. When Anita falls pregnant, Vijay decides to abandon his life in the underworld, marry her, and confess his sins. He also hopes to seek forgiveness from his mother and brother. However, when Anita is brutally murdered by Samant, Vijay loses all sense and brutally murders Samant in revenge for Anita's death, leading him to be branded a criminal forever. Their mother, who had sided with Ravi despite the fact that Vijay was her favourite, is tormented by Vijay's decisions and rejects him. When the two brothers meet for a final clash, Ravi, pleading Vijay to stop running, shoots Vijay in his arm and Vijay dies (after crashing his car into a wall while trying to escape) in his mother's arms in a temple, which he has visited for the first time in his life, seeking forgiveness. Ravi is felicitated for pursuing justice. The Soundtrack of the movie was composed by Rahul Dev Burman, and the lyrics were penned by Sahir Ludhianvi. The soundtrack did well, and the track \"Kehdoon Tumhe\" was a chartbuster. Numerous DVD editions entered the market by companies like \"Eros Entertainment\", \"Shemaroo Entertainment\" and \"Eagle Home Video\". These were released as non-restored, non re-mastered editions and bare bones, void of supplementary features. Eagle Home Video came out with a restored edition of this movie, preserving the original aspect ratio in 4:3 pillar box and a DTS Master Audio (HD) in 2.0. The restoration took place in Shemaroo studios. Deewaar swept most of the major categories at the 1976 Filmfare Awards. Indiatimes ranks Deewaar amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films. It was one of the three Hindi films featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, the others being Mother India (1957) and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995). Rajesh Khanna and Navin Nischol were the first choice for Vijay and Ravi's roles but Salim-Javed insisted that Amitabh Bachchan would suit Vijay's character better. Similarly Nirupa Roy's role was first offered to Vyjayanthimala but she turned it down. In 2014, Bachchan revealed that his iconic look in the film - a \"denim blue shirt worn with khakee pants and a rope dangling over the shoulder\" - was the result of a mistake by the tailor. He said, \"The knotted shirt and rope on shoulder in [Deewaar] was an adjustment for an error in stitching, shirt too long so knotted it\". The film was later remade in Telugu as Magaadu (1976) starring NTR with Rama Krishna, Manjula Vijayakumar and Latha Sethupathi and in Tamil as Thee (1981) starring Rajinikanth, Suman, Manorama and Sripriya and in Malayalam as Nathi Muthal Nathi Vare(1983) starring Mammootty. Naam was also influenced by Deewaar and was written by one of Deewaar's cowriters. British director Danny Boyle, who described Deewaar as being \u201cabsolutely key to Indian cinema\u201d, cited the film as an influence on his Academy Award winning Slumdog Millionaire (2008). Actor Anil Kapoor noted that some scenes of Slumdog Millionaire \"are like Deewaar, the story of two brothers of whom one is completely after money while the younger one is honest and not interested in money.\"",

        "full_text": " Devdas (Hindi: \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0926\u093e\u0938) is a 1955 film directed by Bimal Roy, based on the Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay novel, Devdas. The film had Dilip Kumar in title role, Vyjayanthimala in her first dramatic role where she played as Chandramukhi, hooker with a heart of gold and Suchitra Sen in her Bollywood debut as Parvati in the lead. While Motilal, Nazir Hussain, Murad, Pratima Devi, Iftekhar and Shivraj playing other significant role with Pran and Johnny Walker in extended cameo appearance. In 2005, Indiatimes Movies ranked the movie amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films. Devdas was also ranked at Number 2 on University of Iowa's List of Top 10 Bollywood Films by Corey K. Creekmur. The film was also noted for its cinematography and lighting under Kamal Bose that enhanced the emotional torment of the tight-lipped protagonist played by Dilip Kumar.   Set against the backdrop of rural Bengal during feudal times, Devdas is a young man from a wealthy Bengali Brahmin family in India in the early 1900s. Paro alias Parvati is a young woman from a middle class Bengali Brahmin family, but belonging to a slightly lower status in terms of caste, affluence and status. The two families lived in a village, and Devdas and Paro were childhood friends. Devdas goes away for some years to live and study in a boarding school in the city of Calcutta (now Kolkata). When, after finishing school, Devdas (Dilip Kumar) returns to his village, Paro (Suchitra Sen) looks forward to their childhood love blossoming into their lifelong journey together in marriage. Of course, according to the prevailing social custom, Paro's parents would have to approach Devdas' parents and propose marriage of Paro to Devdas as Paro has longed. When Paro's grandmother (Sarita Devi) makes the proposal to Devdas' mother (Pratima Devi), the latter rejects her. To demonstrate his own social status, Paro's father, Nilkant (Shivraj) then finds an even richer husband for Paro. When Paro learns of her planned marriage, she risks her honor to meet Devdas at night, desperately believing that Devdas will quickly accept her hand in marriage. Devdas meekly seeks his parents' permission to marry Paro, but Devdas' family was against him. In a weak-minded state, Devdas then flees to Calcutta, and from there, he writes a letter to Paro, saying that they were only friends and there was no love between them. But soon realizing his mistake he goes back to village and tells Paro that he is ready to do anything needed to save their love. By now, Paro's marriage plans are in an advanced stage, and she declines going back to Devdas and chides him for his cowardice and vacillation. Parvati's marriage is finalized with a wealthy zamindar and widower (Moni Chatterjee) with children older than his young second wife-to-be. In Calcutta, Devdas' carousing friend, Chunni Babu (Motilal), introduces him to a courtesan named Chandramukhi (Vyjayanthimala). Devdas takes to heavy drinking at Chandramukhi's place, but the courtesan falls in love with him, and looks after him. His health deteriorates because of a combination of excessive drinking and despair of life\u2014a drawn-out form of suicide. Within him, he frequently compares Paro and Chandramukhi, remaining ambivalent as to whom he really loves. Sensing his fast-approaching death, Devdas returns to meet Paro to fulfill a vow that he would see her before he dies. He dies at her doorstep on a dark, cold night. On hearing of the death of Devdas, Paro runs towards the door, disregarding \"purdah\", but her family members prevent her from stepping out of the door. The movie powerfully depicts the prevailing social customs in Bengal in the early 1900s, which are largely responsible for preventing the happy ending of a genuine love story. Dilip Kumar was the first choice of Director Bimal Roy for Devdas. However,he wanted Meena Kumari as Paro, and Nargis as Chandramukhi. But, Meena Kumari could not do the role because her husband Kamal Amrohi laid down certain conditions, which Bimal Roy did not agree with. Nargis refused to do the role of Chandramukhi as she wanted the lead role of Paro. Then the team approached Bina Rai. She refused, too.Suraiya, too, wanted Paro's role. Having no choice they had to take the rising superstar Vyjayanthimala as Chandramukhi. According to the Script writer Nabendu Ghosh \"I did not approve of Vyjayanthimala [as Chandramukhi], but we had no option --- no one wanted to play Chandramukhi, and we were committed to our distributors. We were in dire straits, and Bimalda's unit was big. He never compromised in the making [of his film]. That meant expenses. And we needed money.\"  The Soundtrack of Devdas consists of ten songs composed by Sachin Dev Burman and the lyrics were penned by the veteran poet/lyricist Sahir Ludhianvi.Some of the songs were inspired from the Baul tradition. Apart from this it also features some Thumris at Chandramukhi's place as to demonstrate Tawaif culture.",

        "full_text": " Mega Bollywood Pvt.LTD\nSLB Films Devdas is a 2002 Indian romantic drama film directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and based on the 1917 Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel Devdas. This is the third Hindi version and the first film version of the story in Hindi done in colour. The film follows Devdas (Shah Rukh Khan), a wealthy law graduate in the early 1900s, who returns from his studies in London to marry his childhood sweetheart, Paro (Aishwarya Rai). However, the rejection of this marriage by his own family sparks his descent into alcohol, ultimately leading to his emotional deterioration and him seeking refuge from a prostitute, Chandramukhi (Madhuri Dixit Nene). The film was screened at 2002 Cannes Film Festival and was also screened retrospective, during the 2014 International Film Festival of India in the Celebrating Dance in Indian cinema section. Devdas won the Filmfare Award for Best Film. The film also won five National Awards and a further ten Filmfare Awards, tied with Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge with the most Filmfare Awards any film had won at the time (later beaten in 2005 by Bhansali's Black). It was received well by western audiences alike and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Language Film and was also India's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was ranked #74 in Empire magazines \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010. Time Magazine named Devdas as the best movie of 2002 among all the movies released around the world that year. The film was recently included in Time Magazine's top 10 movies of the millennium worldwide. The acting was seen by many as the primary factor for the film's success, with Shah Rukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit, and Aishwarya Rai all winning Filmfare Awards for their performances. The film's success was also attributed to the dance performances, with Dixit's \"Maar Daala\" considered one of the most iconic of her career and the song \"Dola Re Dola\" becoming a hit due to the unique dance duet between Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit, two of the leading actresses of the epoch. At the time of its release, Devdas was the most expensive Bollywood film ever produced, with a reported budget of \u20b950 crore (US$7.7\u00a0million). The film was a commercial success in India and abroad, becoming the highest grossing Indian film of the year. Shah Rukh Khan has bought the rights to this film under his banner, Red Chillies Entertainment.   In the early 1900s, Kaushalya (Smita Jaykar) hears that her younger son, Devdas (Shah Rukh Khan), is about to return home after leaving 10 years ago for law school in England. Kaushalya tells her neighbor Sumitra (Kirron Kher), who is overjoyed. Sumitra's daughter, Parvati \"Paro\" Chakraborty (Aishwarya Rai) and Devdas share a deep friendship rooted in childhood. When Devdas was sent to England, Paro had lit an oil lamp to prompt his return and never allowed it to extinguish. When Devdas returns, the childhood friendship between him and Paro turns to love. Everyone believes that Devdas and Paro will get married, but Devdas' scheming sister-in-law Kumud (Ananya Khare) reminds Kaushalya of Paro's maternal lineage of nautch girls and nautanki performers, which is inappropriate for the Mukherjee family. Sumitra publicly announces her desire for Devdas and Paro to marry, and Kaushalya rejects and humiliates her in public by saying that she is from a lower class. Devastated, Sumitra hastily arranges Paro's marriage to a man from a family wealthier than the Mukherjees: Thakur Bhuvan Chaudhry (Vijayendra Ghatge), a forty-year-old widower aristocrat with three grown children. When Devdas' father also rejects Paro, Devdas leaves his parents' house and takes refuge at a brothel. He leaves a letter for Paro, falsely stating that love had never existed between them. At the brothel, he meets a good-hearted tawaif (Courtisan) named Chandramukhi (Madhuri Dixit), who falls in love with him. Soon, Devdas realizes his mistake in abandoning Paro. He returns to her during her wedding and asks her to elope but Paro refuses, reminding him of the way he had discarded her so easily. Paro learns from her new husband that he has married her only to be mother to his children and lady of the estate, but that his love is only for his late first wife. She dutifully fulfills her responsibilities, while Devdas, heartbroken at having lost Paro, permanently moves to Chandramukhi's brothel and becomes an alcoholic. When Devdas' father is on his deathbed, he asks to see his son Devdas, but Devdas arrives later, at his father's funeral\u2014shamefully and obviously drunk. He causes a scene and eventually passes out. Eventually, Devdas becomes so ill that the slightest dose of alcohol could kill him. He returns to the family home to heal, and discovers that his sister-in-law has stolen his mother's keys to the family safe. He confronts her but Kumud tells his mother that Devdas had stolen the keys. His mother believes her and Devdas leaves, banished. Paro arrives at Chandramukhi's brothel, accusing her of driving Devdas to drink, but quickly realizes that Chandramukhi loves Devdas. Paro urges Devdas to stop drinking, but Devdas remains stubborn. He promises Paro that before he dies, he will come to her doorstep one last time. Paro invites Chandramukhi to a celebration of Durga Puja at her husband's home and introduces her to her in-laws without revealing Chandramukhi's profession. However, Bhuvan's ill-natured son-in-law Kalibabu (Milind Gunaji), a frequent visitor to the brothel, reveals Chandramukhi's background and humiliates her in front of the guests. He also tells Bhuvan of Paro's relationship with Devdas. As a result, Bhuvan permanently forbids Paro from leaving the mansion. Devdas tells Chandramukhi that she must let him go, and decides to travel the country; on a train, he meets his old college friend Chunnibabu (Jackie Shroff), who urges him to drink in the name of friendship. Devdas drinks, knowing full well it will be fatal. On the verge of death, Devdas travels to Paro's house to honor his promise, collapsing under a tree in front of the main gate. Paro runs through the mansion, attempting to reach him. Bhuvan sees this and orders the servants to shut the gates. Devdas sees a blurred image of Paro running towards him, but the gates close just before she can reach him, leaving her sobbing inside. Devdas whispers Paro's name with his last breath as he slowly dies, and immediately Paro's lamp flickers out. The major part of the movie was filmed at Dharavi, Mumbai, recreating the early 20th century Calcutta. Chandramukhi's kotha was constructed next to an artificial lake, to make it look like a set in Benaras on the Ganges. A temple city surrounded the set, for which inspiration was taken from the Dilwara Temples in Rajasthan. For the creation of Paro's room in a haveli 122,000,008 pieces of stained glass were used. The film soundtrack has been predominantly composed by Ismail Darbar, while lyrics have been penned by Nusrat Badr It features playback singers Shreya Ghoshal (as Parvati), Kavita Krishnamurthy (as Chandramukhi), and Udit Narayan (as Devdas). Ghoshal made her Bollywood debut through this film. She caught the attention of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, who noticed her as a participant in Sa Re Ga Ma while she was singing a bhajan of Lata Mangeshkar, and later offered her the opportunity to playback for the character of Paro. The first Bollywood song Ghoshal recorded in her singing career was \"Bairi Piya\" when she was 16 years old. She sang five songs in the album, which won her much critical acclaim and several accolades, including the prestigious National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer for \"Bairi Piya\". Aniket Joshi of Planet Bollywood gave 9 stars stating, \"Rarely have we an album where ALL the songs are perfectly sung, Devdas is such an album.\" . Reviewer Sukanya Verma writes, \"Sanjay Leela Bhansali's labour of love Devdas is a larger-than-life, poignant and spectacular interpretation. Clearly Devdas is a work of art and heart. His penchant for colour, grandeur, heartbreak unspools throughout the film as it did previously in Khamoshi - The Musical and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The resplendent sets by Nitin Desai --- Paro's stained glass house before marriage, her towering mansion after marriage, Devdas' sprawling house, Chandramukhi's dazzling dance court, even the railway compartment --- are a treat to the eyes.\" About the dances, she writes, \"Pandit Birju Maharaj and Saroj Khan storm the screen with some sensational choreography. Madhuri Dixit's dances are breath-taking.....For all its hype, grandeur, money, blood, sweat, music, tragedy, Devdas is a must-see for even the most pragmatic and unromantic.\" Film critic, Subhash K. Jha, gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 stating, \"Devdas is one of the most outstanding products of the much-maligned Bollywood. It is rich in visual details -- and hats off to Nitin Desai for his sets and Abu-Sandeep, Neeta Lulla and Reza Sharifi for their classy costumes.The characters don't just move in their breathtakingly ornate clothes that seem to have been spun from the most exquisite threads obtainable. Bhansali's characters speak and sing to the viewer. The opulence never smothers the immensity of Chatterjee's emotional tragedy. Hence the film requires at least two viewings for one to understand the visual and emotional layers the narration secretes. In telling the story of Devdas' doomed love for Paro, Bhansali goes beyond places where legendary Bimal Roy had taken the original text in his make of the classic in the 1950s.\" Critic, Taran Adarsh reviewed, \"Devdas has the budget, the canvas, the mounting that no Hindi film can boast of to date. The opulent sets, the grandiose look, the mounting and the ambience makes you gape in astonishment. Technically too, the film is a superior product. The shot execution, the sound quality and the cinematography bowl your mind as you embark on a journey that promises the world as far as entertainment is concerned. Bhansali also deserves bouquets for handling several sequences with aplomb. The Kiron Kher vs. Smita Jayakar fiery confrontation (first half) deserves distinction marks. Ditto for the scene between Madhuri Dixit and Milind Gunaji, when the latter throws a challenge at her. The Madhuri vs. Aishwarya confrontation and the dramatic sequence soon after 'Dola Dola', when Madhuri confronts Milind, are a few instances that endorse the fact that Bhansali is amongst the best in the business.\" Devdas won ten awards at the 2002 Filmfare Awards, and was the fourth film to win the four major awards (Best Movie, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress).

The entire marriage song-sequence in the initial reels, prior to it the scenes involving Sharmila Tagore, Sunil's portions in the second half, clearly indicate that the director knows his job well. He relies more on close-ups to capture expressions, which is the hallmark of a seasoned technician.

It is the second in the Dhoom series. Abhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra star as buddy cops Jai Dixit and Ali, respectively. The duo attempt to capture Mr. A (Hrithik Roshan), a professional thief whose passion is to steal rare and valuable collectibles using high-technology gadgets. The film features Bipasha Basu and Aishwarya Rai in lead female roles. Dhoom 2 was shot primarily in India, Durban, and Rio de Janeiro, becoming the first major Hindi film to be shot in Brazil. The distributor, Yash Raj Films, promoted the film by forging associations with Pepe Jeans and Coca-Cola. It premiered on 24 November 2006 in India, where it received the widest release in Indian cinema history with over 1800 prints. It was dubbed simultaneously in Tamil as well as in Telugu. Singer Vijay Prakash dubbed for ACP Jai Dixit in Tamil. Dhoom 2 was generally well received by critics and audiences; it was accepted well by children and adults.

It is the seventh highest-grossing Bollywood film in overseas markets. After grossing over \u20b91.5 billion (US$23\u00a0million), Dhoom 2 was elevated to a \"blockbuster\" rating on Box Office India. It received an 80% approval rating among critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics praised Dhoom 2 for its exotic locales and elaborate action sequences. However, there was an appeal by the Mumbai city police commissioner to censor the fast-paced rash driving scenes due to fears that it would inspire Indian youths to ride their motorcycles rashly, resulting in an increase in the number of road accidents. A sequel titled Dhoom 3 was released on 20 December 2013, which also went on to become the 5th highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time till date.   The movie opens in the Namib Desert. Mr. A (Hrithik Roshan) skydives onto a train that is carrying the Queen. He steals her crown by disguising himself as the Queen, beats her guards easily, and escapes. Newly promoted officer Ali Khan (Uday Chopra) and Jai Dixit (Abhishek Bachchan) are introduced to Shonali Bose (Bipasha Basu), a special officer assigned to investigate Mr. A's case, who also happens to be a former classmate of Jai. After the initial investigation, Dixit analyses the underlying trend in Mr. A's heists. He concludes that a theft will follow in one of two famous Mumbai city museums. When Dixit realizes that the artifact in the museum he is guarding happens to be imperfect, he rushes to the other museum, where a disguised Mr. A steals a rare diamond and escapes. In a television channel, Mr. A challenges the police that he will steal an ancient warrior sword. In response, Dixit, Bose, and Khan enforce a strict guard at the location of the sword. At night, Mr. A meets a doppelg\u00e4nger in the room that holds the sword. The police are alerted, but they manage to steal the sword and escape. The impersonator turns out to be Sunehri (Aishwarya Rai), a woman who idolises Mr. A; Sunehri convinces Mr. A to form an alliance. In Rio de Janeiro, Mr. A and Sunehri plan their next heist. As Dixit's analysis has named Rio the location of Mr. A's next heist, Jai and Ali travel to the city. There they meet Monali (Bipasha Basu), Shonali's twin sister, and Ali immediately falls for her. Meanwhile, the relationship between Mr. A and Sunehri evolves into romance and he unveils his real identity, Aryan, to her. However, he sees Sunehri and Jai together and realizes that Sunehri has been working undercover for Jai. Aryan forces Sunehri to play a game of Russian roulette. Sunehri cries and refuses to shoot Aryan because she loves him, but Aryan forces her to play. After six attempted shots from the gun, neither is injured, because Aryan has not loaded the gun. Sunehri admits she betrayed Aryan and confesses her love for him. In their final heist, Aryan and Sunehri successfully steal some early Lydian coins while disguised as performing dwarfs. Sunehri indicates that she does not wish to remain allied with Jai, forcing Jai and Ali to go after them. After the chase, all of them end up on the top of a waterfall, where Ali catches Sunehri. Sunehri, despite conveying her feelings for Aryan, shoots him. Aryan falls from the waterfall, after which Jai allows Sunehri to go free. After six months, it is revealed that Aryan has survived and now has opened a restaurant in the Fiji islands with Sunehri.

Jai is aware of the couple's feelings towards each other, but warns them against returning to their life of crime. Jai informs Ali that they should be heading back to India for their next case. Costumes: Anaita Shroff Adajania\nChoreography: Vaibhavi Merchant(All Songs), Shiamak Davar(Title Song) The Dhoom series began with the release of Dhoom in 2004. The film became a commercial box office hit and received generally positive reviews from audiences, but not so much from critics. As a result, producer Yash Chopra announced plans for a sequel, titled Dhoom 2: Back in Action. John Abraham, portrayer of Kabir Sharma, the villain of the predecessor, was eliminated from the sequel because Chopra did not want Dhoom 2 to repeat the stories featured in its predecessor. Instead, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai were introduced into the franchise as the sequel's main villains. Aishwarya Rai's character was summarised as Catwoman, a female fictional comic book femme fatale or anti-hero . Rai stated, \"All I can tell you is it would be nothing like anything you've seen me do before.\" Producer Aditya Chopra told Rai to lose weight after she gained it for her role in 2004's Bride & Prejudice. Yash Chopra stated, \"But yes, the role does require Aishwarya to convey oodles of sensuality. She has asked for a couple of months to get into shape. We (at Yash Raj Films) are very clear about every character in every script and what's required of the actors. Before Dhoom, Esha Deol was specifically briefed about the look and the attitude she needed to cultivate. She readily agreed, and look at what Dhoom did to her career!\" Roshan also lost twelve pounds of weight at Aditya Chopra's request. With the exception of Abraham and Esha Deol, all of the other main actors in Dhoom were hired again for Dhoom 2. Dhoom 2 was filmed in Mumbai (India), Namibia, Durban (South Africa), and Rio de Janeiro, (Brazil), making it the first Bollywood movie to be shot in Brazil. In total, production lasted eighteen months and cost of \u20b9350 million (US$5.4\u00a0million). To ensure the sequel would be different from the original, which became famous for its brash motorcycle stunts, director Sanjay Gadhvi included very few motorcycles in Dhoom 2. Nonetheless, Roshan's role required him to perform several dangerous stunts involving activities such as roller-blading, sand boarding and snow boarding. Dhoom 2 made extensive use of visual effects, which were filmed at Yash Raj Studios. While shooting at Yash Raj Studios, the film suffered from a flood that destroyed the studio sets and delayed production. Fight and action sequences were storyboarded before being shown to Gadhvi and Allan Amin, who would make changes. The scenes were then sketched, given \"proper shot list[s]\", and shared with Tata Elxsi, who oversaw the pre-visualization of the sequences. Several scenes were filmed with the use of green screen and computer-generated imagery. For example, the stunts Roshan's performed on a train in the Namib Desert used green screen; after Roshan recorded the stunts on a set, Gadhvi traveled to the desert to film the background. Other stunts were performed by stuntmen whose faces were later digitally exchanged with the actors'. The bullet effects and Hrithik's gadgets and mechanical arm were also computer generated. The scene involving Abhishek Bachchan coming out of a lake using a jet ski was created using a green screen. The stunt came out at 90 degrees, but Sanjay Gandhvi wanted a 60 degrees jump. So, it was shot with a Super 35, and hence the angle could be changed. Gandhvi discussed the use of technology in an interview: We've done animation and pre-visualization for all the action sequences in Dhoom 2 and that is very important in terms of planning, cost effectiveness and also it's a new way of preparing for shoot and the film specially which is as set on such a large canvas such as Dhoom 2. In Dhoom 1 we had all the action sequences broken down and written. In this movie we had very big action sequences so we had all the scenes storyboarded and they would be checked, double checked and triple checked by myself, Alan Amin and Adi and we would then rectify if needed and that would be our level of planning. The soundtrack of Dhoom 2 was recorded at YRF Studios. The music was composed by Pritam with background score by Salim-Sulaiman. The lyrics were penned by Sameer except \"Dhoom Again\" by Asif Ali Beg and \"Crazy Kiya Re\u00a0\u2014 Remix\" was remixed by Bunty Rajput. Although most of the song's lyrics are primarily written in Hindi with some English, \"Dhoom Again\" is almost entirely in English. The soundtrack pulled average reviews from critics but higher praise from the public. It became the best selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year. All music composed by Pritam. Dhoom 2 was released on 24 November 2006 in India, where it received the widest release in Indian cinema history at the time with over 1800 prints, including 250 digital copies. Some locations raised ticket prices for the film. It was promoted with several tie-ins. Coca-Cola promoted the film as \"Coke Uthale, Dhoom Machale\". India's video game producing company FXLabs developed a game based on the film. Pepe Jeans sold Dhoom 2-related garments, including shirts, jeans, bandannas, caps, and metal accessories. Chetan Shah, the country head of Pepe Jeans London, stated: \"Pepe Jeans is tremendously excited to be associated with the most awaited movie of the year Dhoom:2. The incredible starcast of Hrithik Roshan, Aishwarya Rai, Abhishek Bachchan, Bipasha Basu and Uday Chopra and the exciting and explosive content of the movie encapsulates everything that the Pepe Jeans brand stands for- young, cool, trendy, hip, fashionable and innovative. The city of Mumbai's police commissioner called for censoring of the fast-paced rash driving scenes in the film due to fears that it would inspire Indian youths to ride their motorcycles rashly, resulting in an increase in the number of road accidents. Unlike the original, the robberies depicted in Dhoom 2 were not inspired by any real-life crimes. Dhoom 2, however, inspired the robbery of a man by his nephew, who wore clothing similar to Hrithik's in the film while committing the crime. In India, Dhoom 2 broke several box-office records, mainly those for opening day and opening weekend grosses, including a first week of \u20b966 million (US$1.0\u00a0million) in Mumbai and \u20b9179 million (US$2.8\u00a0million) for all of India. In Mumbai, distributors received a profit of \u20b994 million (US$1.5\u00a0million) on the first week's business. Box Office India awarded it a \"blockbuster\" rating after the film netted \u20b9803 million (US$12\u00a0million) in India and grossed \u20b91.5 billion (US$23\u00a0million) worldwide on a budget of \u20b9350 million (US$5.4\u00a0million). It is currently the 13th highest-grossing film in India (unadjusted for inflation).

Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 4.5 out of 5 stars, reporting \"On the whole, Dhoom 2 is a winner all the way. For Yash Raj, who've not only produced but also distributed the film, Dhoom 2 should emerge as one of the biggest hits of their career.\" Rajesh Karkera of Rediff gave it three and a half stars out of five, calling it \"A complete roller-coaster ride which left me completely enthralled and exhausted. Sure, there are faults when you stop to think rationally. But that does not stop you from being dazzled by the film.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it a three star rating, saying that Dhoom 2 is without doubt better than its predecessor, and that Hrithik Roshan is the heart and soul of the film. Vijay Venkataramanan of Planet Bollywood gave it seven out of ten stars; while complaining about flaws in the plot and Aishwarya Rai\u2019s performance, he still called it a good adrenaline-pumping entertainer. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported 83% of six critics were positive and gave it a \"fresh\" certificate. Variety commented, \"Loaded with enough attitude, Bollywood starpower and buff bodies to stop a speeding train, Dhoom 2 has been doing humongous biz since its November 24 worldwide opening, and provides adequate proof that Yash Raj Films is good for more than just family-oriented comedy-dramas.\" Rachel Saltz of The New York Times reviewed, \"The pleasure principle is palpable in the giddy, slick Dhoom 2, a satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood. It may represent the newfangled Bollywood, but old-fashioned star power is what animates and elevates it above its occasional narrative flaws and longueurs.\" Film Journal International's Ethan Alter said, \"Dhoom 2 has all of the benefits of a big-budget Bollywood production: big-name stars, exotic locales, well-produced musical numbers and elaborate (by Bollywood standards, anyway) action sequences. It makes no lasting contributions to world cinema, but if two-and-a-half hours of disposable entertainment are all you're after, you could do far worse.\" L.A. Weekly's David Chute stated the film was, \"A movie meal as satisfying as this one can make you feel that nothing else matters.\" Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave it a two-star rating, writing \"By roping in acclaimed action director Alan Amin to take care of the thrills and spills, you'd expect Gadhvi to have spent time crafting out a sophisticated storyline instead of simply sending his cast on a cat-and-mouse chase around the globe. It's only Roshan's charismatic performance as the criminal mastermind, and the sizzling chemistry he shares with Rai's sassy cohort, that rescues this adventure from becoming an elongated tourism commercial.\" Manish Gajjar, Bollywood Correspondent for BBC Shropshire said, \"With its high-powered action sequences matching Hollywood standards, Dhoom 2 is a winner all the way at the box office!\" Dhoom 2 was nominated for several awards that year, but only picked up a few of the major ones. At the Filmfare Awards, Hrithik Roshan won the Best Actor, out of five total nominations for the film. At the International Indian Film Academy Awards (IIFA), the film won for Best Makeup and the Best Costume Design. At the Stardust Awards, Aishwarya Rai won Star of the Year\u00a0\u2013 Female and director Sanjay Gadhvi won the Hottest Young Film Maker title. At the 2007 MTV India Style Awards, however, Dhoom 2 swept nearly all of the movie awards, winning the following: Dhoom 2 was released in DVD format on February 2007. It was distributed by Yash Raj Films in all regions as a two-disc set and for region 1 as a single-disc set. It was released on Blu-ray in December 2009. The film is also noteworthy because its soundtrack is the first in Indian cinema to be released in DVD-Audio in addition to other audio formats. The tracks have been mixed in London in 5.1 Surround Sound and audiophiles can choose the format from the audio menu. Four bonus tracks from other films are included, and the lyrics of all 10 tracks can be viewed on-screen while the music is playing, enabling karaoke sing-along.",

Dixit seeks the help of a local bike dealer/racer named Ali Khan (Uday Chopra), and devises a trap to catch the gang, but it fails. Kabir (John Abraham), the leader of the gang, eventually taunts Dixit, stating that Dixit couldn't catch him even if he was right in front of him. He is proven correct and the failure of Dixit seemingly leads to the breakup of his partnership with Ali. Kabir then lures Ali into his gang to take place of Rohit, the gang member who was killed by ACP Dixit. Ali falls in love with Sheena (Esha Deol), another gang member. The gang later goes to Goa to perform one last big heist before disbanding forever. Kabir sets his eyes on the largest casino in all of India.

        "full_text": " Dil Chahta Hai (English: The Heart Desires) is a 2001 Indian comedy-drama film starring Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Akshaye Khanna, Preity Zinta, Sonali Kulkarni, and Dimple Kapadia. The first film written and directed by Farhan Akhtar, it is set in modern-day urban Mumbai and Sydney, and focuses on a major period of transition in the lives of three young friends. In 2001, the film won National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. It performed better in the urban areas of the country compared to the rural areas, which was attributed by critics to the city-oriented lifestyle depicted in which all the characters are from rich or upper-middle-class families. Over the years, it has attained a cult status.   The movie is about three childhood friends, Akash Malhotra (Aamir Khan), Sameer Mulchandani (Saif Ali Khan), and Siddharth \"Sid\" Sinha (Akshaye Khanna). Akash does not believe in the concept of love and does not engage in relationships lasting more than two weeks. Sameer is a genial, well-meaning, desperately romantic, but confused guy who is prone to romantic infatuations and believes to have found true love whenever he gets attracted to a girl. Sid, an artist by profession and the most mature of the three, is not interested in trivial romances and is dedicated to his work. Akash, who is a cad in his personal life, proposes to a girl named Shalini (Preity Zinta) in jest, without being aware that she is engaged to Rohit. He also engineers a breakup between Sameer and his then girlfriend Priya (Suchitra Pillai). The three friends then go to Goa for a vacation. There Sameer falls in love with a foreign lady and while Akash and Sid return, Sameer stays with the lady. However, she turns out to be a cheat and she, along with another man, rob Sameer of his belongings and Sameer is forced to return by lorry. Akash and Sid have a good laugh at his plight. Later, Sameer finds his parents have arranged a meeting with a potential marriage prospect. He resists at first as he does not want an arranged marriage, but the moment he sees the girl, Pooja (Sonali Kulkarni), he realizes that she is \"the one\". Unfortunately, she is in a relationship and Sameer has to be content with just being her friend. Sid befriends and eventually falls in love with Tara Jaiswal (Dimple Kapadia), an older divorcee and alcoholic, who has moved into his neighbourhood and shares his love for art. He decides to keep it from her, suppressing all his feelings as he knows that she, like most other people in society, would consider this relationship scandalous. When his family and friends start finding out, everything goes wrong. Sid's mother is horrified and wrongly accuses Tara of having led Sid on. Akash makes fun of Sid's true intentions and his offensive remarks create a rift in their friendship. Tara hears that Sid has quarreled with friends and family because of her and feeling that she has ruined his life, refuses to see him. Meanwhile, Pooja breaks up with her boyfriend. Sameer and Pooja finally start going out after she breaks up with her boyfriend, and Sameer eventually proposes to her. When his parents send him to Sydney, Australia to work for the family business, Akash finds he is coincidentally seated next to Shalini. He apologises for his earlier prank and asks her to show him around the new city. Though Shalini is engaged, she agrees and soon finds herself enjoying his company. She tries to find out how he feels, but he holds back. Eventually, she then leaves for India to marry Rohit. Akash tries to let her go, but then realises that he is unable to. He returns to India and proposes to her on the eve of her wedding. She accepts with her family's blessing. Tara has been hospitalized with liver cirrhosis and dies with Sid at her bedside. Sid and Akash finally reconcile. Six months later the three friends go to Goa to rekindle fond memories along with Shalini and Pooja. There, Sid meets a pretty girl (Mandala Tayde), who is also vacationing in Goa . They share a smile, implying that Sid is finally moving on from Tara. The movie is partially based on writer-director Farhan Akhtar's diaries on his trips to Las Vegas, his 1996 month-and-a-half long stay at New York City, and a storyline narrated to him by a friend. Farhan Akhtar began work on the script in 1998; the relationship of the characters Akash and Shalini was based on a similar experience of one of Akhtar's friends. Other parts of Dil Chahta Hai were adapted from Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing. Initially, Akhtar wanted Hrithik Roshan, Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna in the three main roles. While Khanna agreed to do the film, Roshan and Bachchan were unavailable. Akhtar offered the part of Akash to Khanna and he offered the part of Sid to Aamir Khan. However, Khan did not want to play Sid and wanted to play Akash instead. Khanna agreed to play Sid so that Khan could play Akash. Afterwards, Saif Ali Khan joined the cast as Sameer. Preity Zinta and Sonali Kulkarni were cast as Shalini and Pooja respectively. Akhtar convinced actress Dimple Kapadia to come out of retirement to play the role of divorc\u00e9e Tara Jaiswal. After 15 months of extensive pre-production, the film was shot over a four-month period in Mumbai, India and Sydney, Australia. Dil Chahta Hai's style extended to the music and its picturisation. One song sequence recapitulates and, to some extent, parodies Bollywood song-and-dance history. Other songs drop the usual dance accompaniment \u2014 one depicts an argument between two protagonists through the song's lyrics, another establishes the character's state of mind through a moody photo collage, while yet another imagines the beautiful and idealised world of an artist in love through a song inside a painting. There is an extended opera sequence at the Sydney Opera House, which was exclusively commissioned for the film. The film received praise from critics for portraying contemporary Indian youth as cosmopolitan and urban. The characters are depicted as upper-class with lavish houses and designer clothes. They attend art exhibitions and performances of Western opera, and travel overseas as a matter of course. Some critics opined that Dil Chahta Hai did not perform well in the non-urban areas because the lifestyle depicted was too city-oriented. Beth Watkins of The Wall Street Journal wrote, \"The mix of humour, emotion, sincerity and wisdom makes \u201cDil Chahta Hai\u201d a truly enduring film.\" Sita Menon of Rediff.com concluded that the film was \"Slick and witty\". Dil Chahta Hai was screened at the International Film Festival of India, the Palm Springs International Film Festival and the Austin Film Festival. In 2016, Akhtar stated that he had \"a lot on his mind\" about a sequel to Dil Chahta Hai.",

        "full_text": " Dil Dhadakne Do (English: Let the Heart Beat) is a 2015 Indian comedy drama film directed by Zoya Akhtar and produced by Ritesh Sidhwani and Farhan Akhtar. The film features an ensemble cast of Anil Kapoor, Shefali Shah, Priyanka Chopra, Ranveer Singh and Anushka Sharma with Farhan Akhtar in a special appearance and Aamir Khan performing voice-over as the narrator of the film in addition to Rahul Bose, Zarina Wahab and many more others in supporting roles. The film tells the story of a dysfunctional Punjabi family who invite their family and friends along on a cruise trip to celebrate the parents' 30th wedding anniversary. The film was released worldwide on 5 June 2015.   Kamal Mehra (Anil Kapoor) is a businessman who owns Ayka, a company on the verge of bankruptcy. He has a troubled relationship with his wife, Neelam (Shefali Shah) and his two children, Ayesha (Priyanka Chopra) and Kabir (Ranveer Singh). The Mehra family also includes their pet dog Pluto (voiced by Aamir Khan). Ayesha owns a successful business of her own, but is unhappy with her marriage to Manav Sangha (Rahul Bose), a controlling, narcissistic husband who, together with his mother Smita (Zarina Wahab), hates Ayesha's family. Kabir unwillingly participates in the family business even though he yearns to become a pilot. In celebration of Kamal and Neelam's 30th wedding anniversary, they invite their family and friends for a 10-day cruise across the Mediterranean. Among their invitees are the Sood family, consisting of businessman Lalit Sood (Parmeet Sethi), his wife Naina (Dolly Mattdo) and their daughter Noori (Riddhima Sud). Kamal and Neelam plan to get Kabir married to Noori, in exchange for Lalit investing in Ayka. On the cruise, Kabir meets dancer Farah (Anushka Sharma) and begins a romantic relationship with her. Noori, on the other hand, is in love with Rana Khanna (Vikrant Massey), the son of Vinod (Manoj Pahwa) and Vandana (Preeti Mamgain). The Khannas, however, are sworn enemies with the Soods, so Kabir and Noori decide to manipulate their parents into believing that they are dating each other, while continuing with their respective relationships. Ayesha considers divorcing her husband, whom she believes is incompatible with her. Her parents, however, are staunchly against it as they believe it will dishonour the family. Meanwhile, Sunny Gill (Farhan Akhtar), the son of Kamal's manager Amrish (Ikhlaque Khan), arrives on the ship. It is revealed that Sunny and Ayesha dated each other as teenagers. Kamal, who was unhappy with their relationship, arranged and paid for Sunny to study abroad to separate his daughter from Sunny. Ayesha realises that she still harbors feelings for Sunny who is now a successful journalist. He, unlike her husband, appreciates her strong personality and believes in female empowerment. Neelam sees Kamal flirting with one of the female guests, and wonders why she did not divorce him despite his past infidelities. Ayesha confronts Sunny about his sudden departure and ends up kissing him, which she later regrets because she is married. Meanwhile, Farah hears that Kabir is planning on marrying Noori, and ends their relationship. Elsewhere, Kamal spots Noori making out with Rana and has a fit, after which he is rushed to the emergency room on-board. At the clinic, Kamal tells Kabir that he saw Noori with Rana and asks him to not be involved with her anymore. Kabir admits to his family that he knew about the couple all along and that he is in love with Farah, a dancer and a Muslim. He also tells them of his intention to leave the family business and asks them to consider Ayesha, who is actually interested in business. He also tries to persuade them to let her proceed with her divorce as she is not happy with the marriage, but Kamal and Neelam still refuse on the grounds of their belief that marriages are lifelong commitments. Infuriated, Kabir reveals to Kamal that Neelam, Ayesha and himself were all aware about his adulterous pursuits and that Neelam has been bearing his infidelities and suffering emotionally in silence to save family. Kamal asks Neelam why she hadn't divorced him and she reveals that she had no choice as her family wouldn't accept her back due to fear of dishonour. Kamal realises his mistake, asks for forgiveness and consoles her. Later, while in efforts to reconcile Manav and Ayesha, Kamal sees how Manav ill treats his daughter and asks him and his mother to leave immediately. He agrees to the divorce and asks Ayesha for forgiveness. Kabir tries to persuade Farah to forgive him for lying to her, but she ends up getting fired from her job for being involved with a passenger and is told to leave the ship. Kabir finds out about her being fired after the ship has set sail. Seeing no other option, Kabir jumps off the ship, aided by Sunny, hoping that his family will rescue him and help him get to the shore. Kamal, Neelam, Ayesha and their dog Pluto eventually find a lifeboat to rescue him. While departing, Ayesha asks Sunny if he would wait for her to which he replies \"forever\". The family picks up Kabir and heads towards the shore while being chased by the ship's crew. The Mehra family is seen happy in each other's presence for the first time. Following the release of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011), it was announced that Zoya Akhtar was working on a script with filming set to start in December 2012. Later it was reported that the script was about siblings, partially based on Zoya Akhtar and her brother Farhan Akhtar. Farhan Akhtar later denied the reports of the film being autobiographical saying that the film has nothing to do with their real life relationship and that it is entirely a work of fiction. In a 2013 interview, Zoya Akhtar revealed that she was still writing the script and that the film was a family drama. Akhtar had always wanted to make a family drama with a brother-sister relationship at the core. She said \"I don't think a brother-sister relationship is well represented in Bollywood. They generally have cheesy representations. They are never at ease. This is one of the most important relationships in the world because nobody else shares your parents.\" The cast consisted of Hrithik Roshan, Kareena Kapoor, Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif. After Ranbir's date issues were apparent, Akhtar approached Ranveer Singh to play the role of the brother opposite Kareena with Katrina as his love interest. Kareena had decided to turn down the offer as she was keen to work with cousin Ranbir. In June 2013 it was rumoured Priyanka Chopra will be replacing Kareena as Ranveer's sister and in October 2013 it was confirmed. Also announced was Anushka Sharma as Ranveer's love interest and Anil Kapoor in a pivotal role. After featuring in Zoya's Luck By Chance and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, brother Farhan Akhtar was confirmed to play a role in the film. Actors Madhuri Dixit, Tabu and Raveena Tandon were all considered for the role of Ranveer's and Priyanka's mother on screen until Shefali Shah was confirmed. Shooting of the film's first schedule began on 17 May 2014. The cast and crew filmed on a Pullmantur Cruises Deck 7 throughout Europe, specifically in France, Spain, Tunisia and Italy for a month. Shooting then proceeded on land in Turkey and was wrapped on 18 July 2014. The shooting of the film's second and final schedule began on 5 August 2014 in Mumbai and was officially wrapped on 23 September 2014. In a 4 star review for Mumbai Mirror, critic Kunal Guha compared Akhtar's direction to that of Woody Allen and Wes Anderson, and praised Priyanka Chopra's performance in it. Conversely, Shilpa Jamkhandikar of Reuters called it \"Akhtar's weakest film yet, because she tries to tell too many stories at once and tells none entirely\". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV criticized the film as well, calling it \"an overly caramelised and flaky dysfunctional family drama that strives - and fails - to strike a balance between the sly and the syrupy\", and gave the film 2.5 stars. Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3.5 stars, praising Akhtar's direction for \"[pulling] off such a magnificent film with such utmost ease.\" Subhash K. Jha also praised the direction, writing that Akhtar proved that she was the \"master of dysfunctional selfserving relationships\" and gave the film 4 stars. Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times, however, gave the film 2 stars, writing \"there is hardly any takeaway from Dil Dhadakne Do and its characters are not likely to stay with you for long\". Film critic Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN, who particularly praised the performances of the lead actors and the humour in the screenplay, concluded that the film is \"easy and breezy, and packed with terrific actors who appear to be enjoying themselves\", although he did criticize the pacing and climax of the film. Srijana Mitra Das of The Times of India gave the film 4 stars, also praising the performances of the lead actors, especially Chopra's and Singh's, and reviewed, \"On this ship, a few bolts could be tighter. But these are fleeting clouds on an otherwise beautiful sea, hosting a cruise...while searching beyond Bollywood's emotional Botox for a family's warts - and its heart.\" Rachit Gupta of Filmfare described the film as a \"spunky comedy, straight from the heart\", attributing the performances of the lead actors as the prime reason for the film's success. Shubha Shetty-Saha of Mid-Day gave the film 4 stars, and praised the story, stating, \"If this film looks like an entertaining, escapist film at the outset, it is, but it is also much deeper than that\". In a 3 star review, film critic Mayank Shekhar of ABP News found that \"patiently drawing out emotions from every character\" made the film \"horrendously long [and] too languidly paced\", although he did call the film \"\"intensely real, intrinsically adult, with several sharp observations about relationships and life\". Sarita A. Tanwar of Daily News and Analysis gave the film 2.5 stars, and wrote that the film would have \"been a lot of fun [if] had it been shorter, crisper and less indulgent\". Scoring the film 3 stars, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com wrote that Dil Dhadakne Do \"unravels like an entire season of soap opera condensed into a nearly three-hour movie\" but found it \"too facile to rise above the charming fluff\". Ritika Bhatia of Business Standard wrote that the film \"does have its enjoyable moments, but with a three-hour runtime, it fails to sail the high seas\", and termed the film \"ambitious\" but \"meandering\". As of 12 July 2015[update], Dil Dhadakne Do had earned approximately \u20b9 86.5 crores nett in India, $6.9 million gross in overseas and \u20b9 165.6 crores worldwide. In the UK, Ireland and Malta, it earned $330,000 in its opening weekend debuting at number 9 at the U.K. box office. The soundtrack of the album is composed by Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy, with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar.",

One day as Raja is walking to his college along with his friends, a passing jeep douses him with mud and the rude response of the beautiful Madhu (Madhuri Dixit) who is driving enrages Raja. He tricks Madhu into thinking that he is blind and then mocks her when the truth is revealed. The two quickly become enemies and play pranks on each other.

As part of his news assignment covering 50 years of India's independence, Amar interviews an extremist leader, who claims that the reason behind human rights violations and poverty in the region is due to the Indian government. A few weeks later, Amar describes his encounter with the woman over the radio, which she hears. He again spots her at a post office. He follows her and tells her that he is in love with her.

Several action sequences in the film choreographed by Allan Amin were shot near Connaught Place, New Delhi, Rajpath and Old Delhi. Dil Se is said to be a journey through the 7 shades of love that are defined in ancient Arabic literature. Those shades are defined as attraction, infatuation, love, reverence, worship, obsession, and death. The character played by Shahrukh Khan passes through each shade during the course of the film. Authors Sangita Gopal and Sujata Moorti of Global Bollywood: Travels of Hindi Song and Dance also compared Khan's romance in the film to the trajectory of love in ancient Arabic literature, believing the lyrics in two of the songs to have delivered an \"apocalyptic fatalism\". The film is a dramatisation of the attraction between a character from the heart of India and another from a peripheral state and a representation of opposites in the eyes of the law and society. Dil Se is described as a film \"structured through deferment and unfulfilled teasing promises.\"  Rediff.com said about the film, \"The entire feel of the film is appropriately poetic, with a few romantic exchanges standing out quite memorably. Tigmanshu Dhulia has handled the film's dialogues adroitly. Amid moonlit desert dunes, there is a particularly stirring conversation between the leading pair. Amar reveals his love for Meghna's eyes -- because he can't see the world hidden behind them, and his hate for the same, stunning eyes -- because he can't see the world hidden behind them.\" Elleke Boehmer and Stephen Morton in their book Terror and the postcolonial (2009) believe that the songs and their exotic locations in the film were very important in masking the impossible reconciliation between a terrorist and an uptight government agent by evoking pure fantasy. They argue that this is a phenomenon called the \"liminal space of dreaming\" in that the terrorist woman cannot fulfill her sexual desire so the songs fill the void of this desire by \"their sumptuousness and exotic locales\" in the Ladakh region. Though Dil Se received a bad response in India, it found success overseas. It was screened at the Era New Horizons Film Festival and the Helsinki International Film Festival The film went on to win the Netpac Award at the Berlin International Film Festival, two National Film Awards, and six Filmfare Awards. The intense political agenda of the film with the trials of the Assamese on the India-China border, the love story and the fact that it coincided with the 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations became a major factor for its success overseas, particularly amongst the South Asian diaspora in the west. The film became the first Indian film to enter the top 10 in the United Kingdom box office charts. Even two months after its release in September 1998 the film was still screened on five screens, five times per day with an average of 3000 spectators a day for each screen alone in the 14-screen Cineworld complex in Feltham, West London. Deepa Deosthalee wrote a positive review to the film, calling it \"A picture perfect ode to love\" and praising the direction, writing and performances. The film has won the following awards: 1999 Berlin International Film Festival (Germany) 1999 National Film Awards (India) 1999 Filmfare Awards (India) 1999 Star Screen Awards (India) The soundtrack features 6 songs composed by A. R. Rahman. Raja Sen of Rediff called it, \"Rahman's finest soundtrack, by far.\" The song \"Chaiyya Chaiyya\" became especially popular, and was featured as one of the top 10 songs of all-time in an international poll conducted by BBC World Service. The song has been featured in the film Inside Man, in the musical Bombay Dreams, and in the television shows Smith and CSI: Miami. This soundtrack is described as a landmark album in Indian music, with each and every song becoming a colossal hit. The soundtrack was recorded in several other languages. The Tamil version of the track \"Chaiyya Chaiyya\", entitled \"Thaiyya Thaiyya\", was sung by Palghat Sriram, although Sukhwinder Singh, who sang the Hindi version was credited as the singer. Malayalam lyrics for the song \"Jiya Jale\" were penned by Gireesh Puthenchery while the Punjabi part of \"Thayya Thayya\" was penned by Tejpaul Kour.[citation needed] Pink Floyd bass guitarist Guy Pratt for post Roger Waters albums Delicate Sound of Thunder, The Division Bell and Pulse played bass on title song Dil Se Re.

Rahul announces his desire to direct a musical named Maya. The members of the troupe, including Nisha, have their doubts about the title character when Rahul describes \"Maya\" as a girl who believes in true love and waits for her prince charming who will surely turn up and take her away. Meanwhile, Pooja (Madhuri Dixit) also has a passion for dancing. Having been orphaned at a young age, she has been raised by close friends of her parents. Pooja and Rahul have a string of near-misses as they run into each other time and again. Each of these instances is marked by a tune that registers with Pooja.

Dil To Pagal Hai was the second of Chopra's four movies to star Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role. It was the third film to feature Shah Rukh Khan opposite Madhuri Dixit. The film was originally titled \"Maine to Mohabbat Kar Li\" and \"Tevar\" before Yash Chopra finally settled on \"Dil To Pagal Hai\" as the title. Originally the first choice for the role, Kapoor was hesitant to take on the project. The role had been offered to Manisha Koirala. Manisha Koirala refused the lead role and Chopra offered it to Juhi Chawla as Chopra wanted the two leading actresses of that time to appear together on screen but Chawla did not want to play second fiddle to Dixit especially after playing the main lead actress in Chopra's Darr. Kajol and Raveena Tandon were next; however, Kajol deemed the role insubstantial while Raveena Tandon was considering quitting her career at the time. The role then was also offered to actress Urmila Matondkar who accepted, but left the film after a day of shooting. No leading lady of that time was willing to take the risk of playing the second lead to Madhuri. Chopra re-approached Kapoor with the film and she agreed to take up the challenge and was finally signed for the role.

For penance, Raj forces Veer to work in the shop day and night. Veer\u2019s friend Siddhu provides him with coffee so he can stay awake to fix the car. However, he falls asleep anyway and awakes to find that the car\u2019s sound system has been stolen. Siddhu takes it to a pawn shop to sell it, having stolen the sound system while Veer was asleep. The men of the local gang leader, King, try to sell drugs at a crab shack. Veer beats them up after they threaten Ishita. They then come back later to exact revenge on Veer, but Raj breaks up the fight. Raj\u2019s men find him at the hospital where Veer is staying and tell him they know where to find King\u2019s men. Raj goes to King's hideout, incapacitates the gang members, and burns their drug stash. Raj tells King\u2019s men his gangster name, Kaali. King stops by Raj\u2019s shop the next day to present a deal where Raj will fix all of King\u2019s cars in exchange for protection. The film then flashes back to Bulgaria. Raj is in a car chase with a rival gang, trying to make off with a container of gold, when he accidentally runs over a woman, Meera. When he gets out to help her, the rival gang catches up with him, and he has to leave. Later, Raj runs into Meera again, who works as a sketch artist. He reveals to her that he is a gangster, and that he is the son of Randhir Bakshi, the leader of the gang. Veer attends a boarding school where Raj only comes to visit once a month. Randhir and Raj talk about how Raj was adopted. Raj meets with Meera again, and she asks him to take care of some guys who are troubling her. She also asks him to celebrate her birthday with her the next day. He promises to take care of a job early and then meet her in the evening. The next day, Raj is engaged in a car chase. His car gets blown up and rolls over, trapping him inside. He is confronted by Meera, who he finds out is the daughter of the rival gang\u2019s leader, Malik. She reveals that their entire relationship so far was designed so that Malik\u2019s gang could have a chance to kill him. She holds a gun to his head, but she chooses to spare his life this time. Later, Raj gets a new car and engages in a car chase with Meera, eventually pushing her car to the edge of a cliff. He saves Meera from falling off the cliff, then tells her that the next time he sees her, he will kill her. Despite this warning, she later comes to his home and tells him that she loves him. At first he refuses to listen to her, but then he admits that he loves her, too. They make plans to tell their parents about their relationship. The film quickly flashes back to Goa, where Veer discovers that Siddhu has been putting sleeping pills in Veer\u2019s coffee so that he fell asleep on his shift, allowing Siddhu to steal items from the shop. Veer is upset, but Siddhu explains it is for his girlfriend, Jenny. They agree to help each other secure girlfriends. As a consequence, Veer reveals his feelings to Ishita. Upon finding out about their relationship, Raj wants to meet Ishita\u2019s family. When Raj visits Ishita\u2019s house, he discovers that Meera is Ishita\u2019s older sister. The film then quickly flashes back to Bulgaria, where Malik agrees to meet Randhir, but, secretly, he plans to kill him. The meeting breaks into a shootout, during which Malik shoots Randhir. Randhir then shoots Malik, and both men die. Raj holds Randhir and takes the gun out of his hand. Meera finds Raj and believes that he killed her father, for which she shoots Raj; however, he survives the gunshot. Both Meera and Raj decide to move far away from Bulgaria and start a new life. The film is again in Goa, where Veer and Ishita come up with several plots to bring Meera and Raj together. As a side plot, Mani steals King\u2019s car and brings it to the shop, where Veer discovers drugs in the trunk and decides to burn them. Ishita tells Raj that Meera has not forgotten her first love. King comes to Meera\u2019s house one night, but Raj, as Kaali, shows up and stops them from causing her any harm. King asks Meera later if she knows Kaali, but she refuses to acknowledge their relationship. Meera issues an ultimatum that in order to marry Ishita, Veer must move in with Meera. Meera also tells him that Raj is adopted and not his blood brother. Veer says that he loves Ishita, but he cannot abandon his brother. Raghav, one of Malik\u2019s men, decides to tell Meera that Raj did not kill Malik, but that Malik had shot Randhir, who had shot Malik in return. Upon learning this, Meera tells Veer that he can marry Ishita and stay with Raj. Siddhu and Jenny get married. King shows up at the wedding, having tracked down his stolen car, which is now being used as the bride and groom\u2019s getaway car. King starts to cause a disturbance, but Raj beats him up. King then tries to shoot Raj, but accidentally shoots Meera. The gunshot doesn't turn out to be fatal. In January 2015, Rohit Shetty announced a project with Shah Rukh Khan in the lead which would be their second collaboration after the 2013 film Chennai Express. Shetty stated that he would start filming in March 2015. Shetty paired actress Kajol with Khan, making it the seventh time they were cast opposite each other. He also signed actor Varun Dhawan who was reportedly playing Khan's brother while actress Kriti Sanon was signed opposite him. Principal photography began on 20 March 2015 with Dhawan in Goa. Khan and Kajol first joined the crew for filming in Bulgaria from June 2015. Later that month, the first song from the film was shot on Dhawan and Kriti Sanon, in Bulgaria. The schedule there was wrapped up by late July. In August 2015, a romantic song featuring the lead pair was shot in Iceland. The entire team then left for Hyderabad in early September to shoot what was touted to be the final schedule of filming. However, the work in Hyderabad was completed by late October, and filming officially came to an end with a brief schedule in Goa, the same location where it was started. In December, after the promotions had commenced, another song was shot in haste. It featured all four lead actors and had to be played simultaneously with the end-credits. Dilwale was released in the United Arab Emirates a day before its worldwide release on 18 December 2015. The film was released in around 3100 screens in India. The satellite rights of the film were sold to Sony Pictures Networks as part of a deal worth \u20b9220 crore (US$34\u00a0million), along with the next two or three Red Chillies Entertainment productions. The valuation of Dilwale alone was approximately \u20b960 crore (US$9.3\u00a0million). On 14 December 2015, in the United Kingdom, the film received a 12A classification from the British Board of Film Classification for \"moderate violence\". The film's UK distributor chose to remove thirteen seconds in order to obtain this rating (the excised material being scenes involving stronger violence than possible for a 12A rating). An uncut 15-rated version is available. Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama gave the film 4/5 stars, saying, \"On the whole, Dilwale is akin to a mouthwatering meal that satiates the craving of those who relish masalathons, besides being an absolute treat for SRK-Kajol fans. An unadulterated crowd-pleaser, Dilwale delivers what you expect from a Rohit Shetty film: King-sized entertainment. Go for it!\". Komal Nahta in his review of the film said, \"Dilwale is a masala entertainer from the start till the end.\" Rachit Gupta from Filmfare gave it 4/5 stars and added, \"Dilwale is the quintessential popcorn flick. It\u2019s colorful, bright and entertaining. It smartly keeps its play on the SRK-Kajol chemistry (watch out for the brilliant ending). It has fantastic music. Decent laughs too. Definitely worth a dekho.\" Sarita A Tanwar of DNA gave the film 3/5 stars, saying \"Dilwale is flawed, but it's right for those who believe that love does conquer it all, actually.\" Ananya Bhattacharya of India Today also rated the film 3/5 and concluded, \"Dilwale is immensely enjoyable despite an oh-my-god-this-is-so-predictable story. Keep your brains out of the picture, and you have an out-and-out entertainer which fits perfectly in the mould of a guilty pleasure. Go indulge!\" Shubha Shetty-Saha of Mid Day gave the film 3 stars as well and said, \"Watch this for the chemistry between SRK and Kajol which refuses to simmer down even after all these years.\" Meena Iyer from The Times of India gave the film 3/5 stars, criticizing the plot, and stated, \"Dilwale leans heavily on Shah Rukh's mega-stardom, Varun's effervescence, breathtaking locales (Iceland and Bulgaria), orchestrated car chases and over-the-top situations, which have you chuckling.\" NDTV felt that the film's plot \"went in circles\" and that while Kajol was great, the film overall failed to appeal. The Economic Times gave the film 2.5/5 stars and felt that it \"lacked soul and freshness\" and stated that it would only appeal to fans of Khan and Kajol. Rajeev Masand of IBN Live gave the film 2 out of 5 and said, \"The real problem with Dilwale is the sheer artificiality of the enterprise. From the rainbow-hued sets and the touched-up landscapes in the Gerua song, to many moments of comedic and emotional payoff, so much of it just feels fake.\" Namrata Joshi of The Hindu commented, \"With Dilwale, Rohit Shetty goes hopelessly wrong despite much that he had at his disposal, including a power-packed cast and producer\". Joshi also felt that the attempt to repackage Khan and Kajol had backfired. Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times gave the film a 1.5/5 rating and called the plot \"highly predictable\". Dilwale made around \u20b9150 crore (US$23\u00a0million) worldwide in its opening weekend, the third highest of the year. The film, releasing alongside Bajirao Mastani, opened number one at the box office, and collected \u20b921 crore (US$3.2\u00a0million) nett in India on its opening day, the third highest of the year after Prem Ratan Dhan Payo and Bajrangi Bhaijaan. The film showed little drop on its second day, and earned nearly \u20b920 crore (US$3.1\u00a0million) nett. On its first Sunday, Dilwale took in approximately \u20b923 crore (US$3.6\u00a0million) nett, bringing the three-day nett to an estimated \u20b964 crore (US$9.9\u00a0million). Dilwale had a first week of \u20b997 crore (US$15\u00a0million) nett in the domestic market. The film earned around \u20b921 crore (US$3.2\u00a0million) nett in its second weekend. It grossed little over \u20b931 crore (US$4.8\u00a0million) nett in week two, taking its business to \u20b9127 crore (US$20\u00a0million) nett. The film made around \u20b911 crore (US$1.7\u00a0million) nett more in the third week, and finished with a total of \u20b9140 crore (US$22\u00a0million) nett in India. Dilwale had the highest opening of 2015 abroad and the second highest ever, with a weekend gross of around $8.5 million. The film also set an all-time record opening in the Gulf. In Pakistan, the film earned \u20b96.5 crore (US$1.0\u00a0million) in its first three days. The film collected \u20b99.13 crore in Pakistan in three weeks. The film went on to earn over $13 million overseas in the first week, again the highest of the year. Dilwale grossed another $3.75 million in the second weekend, for an overall $16.75 million in ten days. After two weeks, the film's earnings abroad were more than $20.5 million. The film had grossed around $23.3 million outside India as of 12 January 2016 to become the highest-grossing film starring Shah Rukh Khan in overseas markets. Dilwale had expanded its business abroad to higher than $25 million following release in new markets like Germany, Netherlands and Indonesia. At the end of its theatrical run in overseas, the film has earned approximately $26.6 million (INR 175.65 crore).

        "full_text": " Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (English: The Big-Hearted Will Take Away the Bride), also known by the initialism DDLJ, is an Indian romance film written and directed by Aditya Chopra (In his directorial debut) and produced by his father Yash Chopra. Released on 20 October 1995, the film stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol. The plot revolves around Raj and Simran, two young non-resident Indians, who fall in love during a vacation through Europe with their friends. Raj tries to win over Simran's family so the couple can marry, but Simran's father has long since promised her hand to his friend's son. The film was shot in India, London and Switzerland, from September 1994 to August 1995. Earning \u20b91.06\u00a0billion (valued at about US$32,766,000 in 1995)[a] in India and \u20b9160\u00a0million (valued at about US$4,946,000 in 1995)[a] overseas, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge became the highest grossing Bollywood film of the year, and one of the most successful Indian films of all time. It won 10 Filmfare Awards, the most for a single film at that time, and won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. Its soundtrack album became one of the most popular of the 1990s. Many critics praised the film, which connected with different segments of society by simultaneously promoting strong family values and the following of one's own heart. Its success led other film makers to target the non-resident Indian audience, which was deemed more lucrative for them. It spawned many imitations of its story and style, and homages to specific scenes. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was one of only three Hindi films in the reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and was placed twelfth on the British Film Institute's list of top Indian films of all time. It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema. As of 2017, over 20 years after its first release, it is still being shown at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai.   Raj Malhotra (Shah Rukh Khan) and Simran Singh (Kajol) are non-resident Indians living in London. Simran was raised by her strict and conservative father, Baldev Singh (Amrish Puri), while Raj's father (Anupam Kher) was very liberal. Simran always dreams of meeting her ideal man. Her mother Lajjo (Farida Jalal) warns her against this, saying dreams are good but one should not blindly believe they come true. One day, Baldev receives a letter from his friend Ajit (Satish Shah), who lives in Punjab. Ajit wants to keep a promise he and Baldev made to each other 20 years ago\u2014to have Simran marry his son Kuljeet (Parmeet Sethi). Simran is disappointed\u2014she does not want to marry someone whom she has never met. One evening, Raj enters Baldev's shop after closing time to buy beer. Baldev refuses and Raj grabs a case of beer, throws the money on the counter and runs away. Baldev, infuriated, calls Raj a disgrace to India. Meanwhile, Raj's father has agreed to his request to go on a train trip across Europe with his friends, and Simran's friends have invited her to go on the same trip. Simran asks her father to let her see the world before her marriage, and he reluctantly agrees. On the trip, Raj and Simran meet. Raj constantly flirts with Simran, much to her irritation. The two miss their train to Zurich and are separated from their friends. They start to travel with one another and become friends. Raj falls in love with Simran on the journey; when they part ways in London, Simran realises she is in love with him too. Simran tells her mother about the boy she met; Baldev overhears the conversation and becomes furious with Simran. He says the family will move to India the next day. Meanwhile, Raj tells his father about Simran and that she will soon be getting married. When Raj says he believes Simran loves him too, his father encourages him to go after her. In India, Baldev is reunited with his relatives and his friend Ajit. Simran and her younger sister Chutki take an instant dislike to Simran's fianc\u00e9 Kuljeet because of his arrogance. Simran cannot forget Raj and is miserable about having to marry Kuljeet. Her mother tells her to forget Raj because she knows Baldev will never accept their relationship. The next morning, Simran is reunited with Raj when he arrives outside of the house where she is staying. She begs him to run away with her. Raj refuses and says he will only marry Simran with her father's consent. Raj befriends Kuljeet and is quickly accepted by both families. Later, Raj's father arrives in India and also becomes friends with Simran's and Kuljeets's families. Eventually Lajjo and Chutki discover that Raj is the boy Simran fell in love with in Europe. Lajjo also tells Raj and Simran to run away, but he still refuses. Baldev recognises Raj from the beer incident, but eventually accepts him. However, after he discovers a photograph of Raj and Simran together in Europe, he insults and slaps Raj and tells him to leave. As Raj and his father are waiting at the railway station, Kuljeet, who is angry on hearing of Raj's love for Simran, arrives with his friends and attack them. Eventually Baldev and Ajit arrive and stop the fight. Raj boards the departing train with his father. Simran then arrives with her mother and sister; she tries to join Raj on the train but Baldev stops her. Simran begs him to let her go, saying she cannot live without Raj. Baldev realises nobody can love his daughter more than Raj does. He lets her go, and she runs and catches the train as it departs. Credits adapted from British Film Institute. Aditya Chopra assisted his father, director and producer Yash Chopra, during the making of Chandni (1989), Lamhe (1991) and Darr (1993). During this time, Aditya wrote several of his own scripts, including one he assumed would be his first film, but eventually became his second, Mohabbatein (2000). For three years, he worked on the story that would become Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge before approaching his father to direct it. Yash did not want to, and tried to persuade Aditya to do it himself. As they were discussing ideas for the script, Aditya conceived the notion that Raj would seek permission for marriage from Simran's stern father, rather than eloping with her. He then became excited about the possibility of directing the film himself. After his mother, the playback singer Pamela Chopra, agreed that the idea was sound, he decided to make this his directorial debut. Aditya wanted to make a wholesome film that people could watch repeatedly. He wanted to diverge from the typical plot line of the time, in which lovers run away when their parents object, and show that if their love was strong enough, the parents would eventually understand. In May 1994, Aditya read the first draft of the script to several members of the Yash Raj Films production team assigned to work with him, including a cinematographer, an art director and a dialogue writer. They were not impressed, but Aditya held fast to his ideas. He was given total editorial control by his father, the producer, and made the film according to his own tastes and sensibilities. Aditya struggled with both the dialogue writer Javed Siddiqui and the song lyricist Anand Bakshi to develop words that were \"young-sounding\". There were personal clashes over writing credits on the final script. Pamela's friend Honey Irani believed she deserved a writing credit that she did not receive, and Siddiqui believed Aditya did not deserve partial credit for the dialogue. After Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, neither of them ever worked with Yash Raj Films again. After approving the script, Yash was consulted about the songs, but mostly left the creative process to his son, and has firmly denied that he was a ghost director on the project. He did not shoot a single frame, and did not even view some portions of the film until it was nearly completed. Aditya originally wanted the film to be about a relationship between an Indian and an American. He wanted Tom Cruise for the role of Raj but was dissuaded by Yash, who did not want to use a foreign star. They decided their characters would be non-resident Indians (NRIs). Aditya approached Shah Rukh Khan to play the role of Raj. Shah Rukh was initially not interested because of the romantic nature of the role, having had success playing villainous roles. Aditya then asked Saif Ali Khan to play the lead role because he was having problems persuading Shah Rukh to do it. Saif declined for unknown reasons, as did Aamir Khan, causing Aditya to continue pursuing Shah Rukh.[b] Aditya and Shah Rukh had four meetings over several weeks; he finally persuaded Shah Rukh by telling him he could never be a superstar unless he became \"every woman's dream man, and every mother's dream son\". Since then, Shah Rukh has expressed his gratitude to Aditya for helping to make him a star with this film. Shah Rukh said that fellow actor Salman Khan also encouraged him to do the role, saying that he thought the film would be very successful. Shah Rukh has also noted the similarities in the film's script to his own relationship with Gauri Khan before their marriage. Kajol was the first choice to play Simran, to which she quickly agreed; she was a good friend of Aditya. She and Shah Rukh had previously worked together in the successful films Baazigar (1993) and Karan Arjun (1995). Kajol said her character was very difficult for her to relate to, whereas Shah Rukh said Raj's personality was very similar to his own. Aditya chose the name Raj for the character, and the mandolin that he played, based on his admiration for the actor Raj Kapoor. After a successful screen test, Parmeet Sethi was chosen over Armaan Kohli for the role of Kuljeet Singh. In addition to his assistant director Sameer Sharma, Aditya asked for two additional assistants, his brother Uday Chopra and his friend Karan Johar. Johar also played a small role in the film as Raj's friend. Sharmishta Roy was the film's art director and Manish Malhotra was its costume designer. While Malhotra had many new ideas, Aditya wanted to keep the clothing style simple; he did not want it to distract from the story. Despite this, Malhotra was responsible for the idea of Simran wearing a green dress in the song \"Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna\", an unusual colour for a Punjabi bride. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was filmed in several 5-, 10- and 20-day schedules between September\u00a01994 and August\u00a01995. The first sequence filmed was for the song \"Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko\" with Kajol and Shah Rukh in Switzerland. The European journey scenes and songs were mainly filmed in Saanen, Montbovon and Gstaad, Switzerland. Other scenes were shot in England, at locations including Trafalgar Square, King's Cross railway station and Angel tube station. Film's cinematographer Manmohan Singh, a regular collaborator with Chopra, shot the song \"Tujhe Dekha To\", including the iconic mustard fields scenes with Shah Rukh and Kajol in the mustard fields in Gurgaon on the outskirts of the National Capital Region Delhi. Saroj Khan was the choreographer throughout most of the production, but after several disputes between her and Aditya, she was replaced by Farah Khan near the end of the shoot. After the film's eventual success, Saroj apologised to Aditya for underestimating him, but she never worked with him again. Farah choreographed the song \"Ruk Ja O Dil Deewane\", during which Aditya did not tell Kajol that Shah Rukh was going to drop her, as he wanted to capture her genuine reaction. The film's title was suggested by actress Kirron Kher; it came from the song \"Le Jayenge Le Jayenge\", in the film Chor Machaye Shor (1974). The Raj character sings parts of this song during the story, and it recurs at the end. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is believed to be the only Bollywood film with a \"Title suggested by\" credit. The film has since become universally known by the acronym DDLJ. Towards the end of the principal photography, Shah Rukh had to split his time between this film and Trimurti (1995), spending half of his day on each film. In early August\u00a01995, when filming on Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was not yet finished, a release date in October around the time of the Diwali festival was decided upon. Composers Jatin and Lalit Pandit were given only 10 days to complete the background score, and the first copies were printed on 30 September. After filming was complete, Aditya decided to make a Hollywood-style documentary of the film-making process, which had not been done before in India. Karan Johar and Uday were put in charge because they had already been recording some of the process. On 18 October, two days before the film's release, the 30-minute special Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, The Making was broadcast on television by Doordarshan. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge repeats the usual conservative agenda of family, courtship and marriage, but it proposes that Indian family values are portable assets that can be upheld regardless of country of residence. To prove this, Raj, an NRI who was brought up in London, is portrayed as the story's \"good guy\", whereas Kuljeet, raised in India, is portrayed as the villain. This is a reversal of the roles in typical Indian films, which usually portray Indians as being morally superior to Westerners. Here, NRIs are validated as potential model Indians citizens. The story aims to capture the struggle between traditional family values and the modern value of individualism. Although Raj and Simran want to be together regardless of her father's plans for her, Raj tries to win over his girlfriend's father rather than simply eloping with her. In this and other Indian stories, family values are ultimately considered more important than the romantic plot. Moral values and rules of conduct take precedence over individual desires. The film implies that \"Indianness\" can be defined by the importance of family life; whether at home or abroad, it is the Indian family system that is recognised as the social institution that most defines Indian identity. In Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, the purity/sanctity of women is being related that of the nation. In the scene after Raj and Simran spend the night together, and Simran is concerned that something happened, Raj tells her: \"You think I am beyond values, but I am a Hindustani, and I know what a Hindustani girl's izzat (honour) is worth. Trust me, nothing happened last night.\" This speaks to the Indian diaspora and their need to try and sustain their value system, and the man's responsibility to protect the Indian woman's sexual purity. In The Routledge Encyclopedia of Films, Ranjani Mazumdar says the film has a running theme of unfulfilled desires, which is exemplified by Raj's father telling him to enjoy life because his own was a struggle, and Simran's mother telling her to run away with Raj because she was unable to live her own dreams. Scott Jordan Harris, writing for Roger Ebert's website, says the film's popularity lies in its ability to effectively convey two opposing themes appealing to different portions of society. He said, \"It argues that we should follow our hearts and chase happiness wherever it leads, regardless of the obstacles in our paths, while simultaneously suggesting we should respect the ways of our elders, particularly our parents, and do nothing that challenges their will\". Rachel Dwyer said the film was important for presenting marriage as an understanding between parents and children. While fighting the old tradition of the arranged marriage, it still encouraged the importance of seeking parental consent, even for a love marriage. According to Patricia Uberoi, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge reiterates the theme of Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994)[c] in a self-conscious manner while also linking it explicitly to the fact that the protagonists tend to remind themselves and each other of what it means to be an Indian. The Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge soundtrack features seven songs composed by Jatin Lalit, a duo consisting of the brothers Jatin and Lalit Pandit. Anand Bakshi wrote the lyrics and Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Kumar Sanu, Abhijeet Bhattacharya and Udit Narayan performed the vocals. Jatin Lalit was considered for the job when singer Asha Bhosle contacted Yash Chopra after meeting the duo. It was their first collaboration with Yash Raj Films. They secured the job after singing \"Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna\" for Yash. In return, they ensured she sang one song, \"Zara Sa Jhoom Loon Main\". Pamela Chopra helped them select tunes and instruments to give some of the songs a Punjabi flavour. Bhasker Gupta, writing for AllMusic, said the soundtrack was the best of Jatin Lalit's career, and that it \"marked the beginning of the fifth wave in Indian cinema\u00a0...\". The soundtrack became the best-selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year, with 9\u201312\u00a0million units sold according to HMV, although it is estimated the same number or more copies were pirated. More than 1\u00a0million of those sales occurred prior to the film's release. In 2005, the album was judged the top Hindi soundtrack of all time by voters on the BBC Asian Network website. Anand Bakshi won his third Filmfare Best Lyricist award after 14 years, having two nominations for this film. The wedding song \"Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna\" from the film became an all-time hit; it is played at weddings across the South Asian diaspora. The following is the track listing. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge opened on 20 October 1995 to sold-out shows worldwide. Every show in every theatre in Mumbai\u2014save one\u2014was completely full for the first week. The film was popular among both resident Indians and NRIs. At San Francisco's 720-seat Naz theatre, 1,000 people arrived for the first showing, and the theatre staff were forced to run another show late that night. In the UK, the film ran for over a year, and as of 2015, the Maratha Mandir cinema hall in Mumbai has been showing it for more than 19 years. The film earned \u20b91.06\u00a0billion (valued at about US$32,766,000 in 1995)[a] in India and \u20b9160\u00a0million (valued at about US$4,946,000 in 1995)[a] overseas; it became the biggest Bollywood grosser of the year, and the second highest-grossing film of the 1990s behind Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!. It was the second Bollywood film to gross over \u20b91\u00a0billion worldwide, and one of the biggest Bollywood earners of all time. Adjusted for inflation, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is believed to be among the five highest-grossing Hindi films; its adjusted gross is approximately \u20b92.93 billion (US$45\u00a0million). As of 2009, the film had generated over \u20b960 million (US$930,000) in revenues for the Maratha Mandir since its release. In later years, that theatre ran one matinee show per day at reduced ticket prices, which averaged about 50% occupancy. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge received many favourable reviews. An initial review by weekly magazine Screen said of Aditya Chopra, \"A young master arrives\". Tom Vick, reviewing the film for Allmovie, said, \"An immensely likeable movie, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge performs the rarely achieved feat of stretching a predictable plot over three hours and making every minute enjoyable.\" When the film toured the U.S. in 2004 as part of the Cinema India showcase, \"The Changing Face of Indian Cinema\", Charles Taylor reviewed the film for Salon and said, \"It's a flawed, contradictory movie\u2014aggressive and tender, stiff and graceful, clich\u00e9d and fresh, sophisticated and naive, traditional and modern. It's also, I think, a classic.\" Writing for NDTV, Anupama Chopra said, \"Perhaps the innocence of Raj and Simran's romance in which they can spend the night together without sex because Raj, the bratish NRI understands the importance of an Indian woman's honor. Perhaps it's the way in which the film artfully reaffirms the patriarchal status quo and works for all constituencies\u2014the NRI and the local viewer. Or perhaps it's the magic of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol who created a template for modern love, which was hip and cool but resolutely Indian.\" She also called the film a milestone that shaped Hindi cinema through the 1990s, and one of her personal favourites. In 2004, Meor Shariman of The Malay Mail called the film a \"must watch\" for Bollywood fans, and also for those seeking an introduction to Bollywood. Raja Sen gave a reflective review for Rediff.com in 2005, calling the film one of the best Hindi films made in the previous 20\u00a0years. He said \"Shah Rukh Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the Lover for the 1990s with great panache\", and called Kajol a \"real-as-life actress bringing warmth and credulity\" to her role. Sen called the film well balanced and said only the fight scene and some mother-daughter dialogue can wear after multiple viewings. Omer M. Mozaffar, writing for Roger Ebert's website in 2012, likened the film to a Disney Princess story, saying, \"the young princess feeling trapped by the traditional patriarchy, seeking freedom through discovering the world, but finally finding it through silent, but inappropriate love. The Little Mermaid. Beauty (of the Beast). Jasmine (friends with Aladdin). Pocahontas. Aurora (Sleeping Beauty). And here, Simran.\" Scott Jordan Harris, also writing for Roger Ebert in 2014, called it \"one of the world's favorite films\", and said it plays as a masterful soap opera, with one of the best screen couples ever seen. Sogosurvey conducted an online survey in 2016 in which approximately 47% of the people who participated voted Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge as Bollywood's most evergreen love story. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was ranked among The Times of India's list of the \"10 Bollywood movies you must see before you die\". It was one of three Hindi films in the film reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, the others being Mother India (1957) and Deewaar (1975). It was placed twelfth on the British Film Institute's list of top Indian films of all time. It is one of the films on Box Office India's list of \"Biggest Blockbusters Ever in Hindi Cinema\". The film won a National Film Award and 10 Filmfare Awards, setting the record at the time for the most Filmfare trophies.[d] In 2001, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge overtook Sholay (1975), which had run for over five years at the Minerva theatre, as the longest-running film in Indian cinema history. It has been showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre (which was famous for having shown Mughal-e-Azam (1960) for three years) since its original release in 1995. There are often people in the audience who have seen the film 50 or more times, but still clap, cheer, mouth the dialogues and sing along with the songs, raising comparisons with The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), the longest running film in America. When a theatre strike in early 2011 threatened the film's uninterrupted run, the producer Yash Chopra contacted theatre owners to try and ensure the film would continue. He hoped the film would continue to run for at least 1,000 weeks, which it achieved in December\u00a02014. To commemorate the event, cast members including Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Anupam Kher, Farida Jalal, Mandira Bedi and Pooja Ruparel appeared on the television show Comedy Nights with Kapil. Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and director Aditya Chopra also attended a live chat with fans and a black tie event at the theatre on 12 December. The same day, they launched a coffee table book written by Aditya Chopra about the making of the film. Also in December, Yash Raj Films announced the availability of a collection of commemorative, licensed merchandise from various suppliers to mark the event. The Maratha Mandir's management ended the film's run after 1,009 weeks on 19 February\u00a02015 because of low attendance (the last show was viewed by 210 people). However, after an outpouring of support from fans, and talks with the production company, they decided to reinstate the film. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge spawned many imitators of its story and style, especially throughout the 1990s. According to the Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema, it and a handful of other films and young directors started a trend for \"designer\" films. The authors said that these were \"a carefully packaged and branded product in which every little visual and physical detail\u00a0... is of utmost importance\". In Bollywood's Top 20: Superstars of Indian Cinema, Namrata Joshi said Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge \"reinvented Bollywood romances so decisively that we can neatly divide them into two eras\u2014before DDLJ and after DDLJ\". Yash Raj Films was previously known for using locations outside India for item numbers in its films. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge started the trend for films designed to appeal to the Indian diaspora, which have foreign locations as integral parts of the story. The characters are themselves diaspora and tend to be able to move with ease between India and the West. Some later films that followed this trend include Pardes (1997), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Salaam Namaste (2005), Neal 'n' Nikki (2005) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge became the first Hindi film blockbuster to feature NRIs as main characters. It helped to establish the diaspora market as a vital source of revenue for the industry; that market was seen as a safer financial investment than the desi market. Several later films have paid homage to Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. The Karan Johar-produced Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania (2014) was directly inspired by it. The films Jab We Met (2007), Bodyguard (2011), Chalo Dilli (2011), Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013) and Chennai Express (2013) include scenes similar to the climactic train sequence, wherein a woman is running to catch a moving train and is helped aboard by a man with his outstretched arm. The British film Slumdog Millionaire (2008) contained a similar train scene, and its final dance sequence was partially shot at the same railway station as the Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge finale. Audiences appreciated the screen chemistry between Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, who later worked together in several successful films including Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), My Name Is Khan (2010), and Dilwale (2015), and are often referred to as Indian cinema's most loved on-screen couple. Shah Rukh Khan credits this film with making him a star, and says it \"changed the entire scene for romantic movies of the 90s\". During an interview in 2002, he said \"Whatever I'll stand for as an actor, in the whole of my career, whenever it ends, it will start with and end at Dilwale\". The actress Farida Jalal said the film gave her career a boost, saying she got many offers and \"could quote any price\". It also helped the young careers of Pooja Ruparel, who received advertising offers, and of Sharmistha Roy. The British Film Institute (BFI) commissioned a book about Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. It was the first Hindi film chosen for a series of studies on international films, called \"BFI Modern Classics\". The author was Anupama Chopra and the book was released in 2002. It was reissued in paperback by Harper-Collins as Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge: The Making of a Blockbuster in 2004. After an unexpectedly long delay, the film was released on DVD by Yash Raj Films in 2002. The release included The Making and 300 Weeks Celebration documentaries, Success Story (highlights from the film's premiere), clips from the 41st Filmfare Awards ceremony and other interviews. In 2006, members of the film crew were honoured at a dinner event to celebrate the film's 500th week since release. It was hosted by the Consulate General of Switzerland in Mumbai and by Switzerland Tourism. In 2010, Yash Raj Films signed an agreement with Indian and Swiss tour companies to provide a tour package called \"YRF Enchanted Journey\", to allow visitors to Switzerland to view filming locations used for famous Yash Raj films including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. In 2014, Yash Raj Films released Aditya Chopra Relives\u00a0... Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (As Told to Nasreen Munni Kabir), an attractive but expensive book about the making of the film. In response to Indian prime minister Narendra Modi quoting the line \"May the force be with you\" from the American film franchise Star Wars during a visit to the U.S., President Barack Obama decided to quote a line from a Hindi film during his visit to India in January\u00a02015. He chose a line from this film, \"Senorita, bade bade deshon mein\u00a0...\" (Miss, in large countries\u00a0...), and added \"you know what I mean\".",

The film is known for its socialist theme, and is an important film in the early parallel cinema of India and is considered a trend setter. A bigha is a measure of land area but is not same as an acre, though translating the title as such serves the purpose. Inspired by Italian neo-realistic cinema, Bimal Roy made Do Bigha Zameen after watching Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948). Like most of Bimal Roy's movies, art and commercial cinema merge to create a movie that is still viewed as a benchmark. It has paved the way for future cinema makers in the Indian neo-realist movement and the Indian New Wave, which began in the 1950s. A moderate commercial success, it was awarded the All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film, it became the first film to win the Filmfare Best Movie Award and the first Indian film to win the International Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, after Neecha Nagar (1946), which won the Palme d'Or (Grand Prize). In 2005, Indiatimes Movies ranked the movie amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films.   The story revolves around a farmer Shambu Mahato (Balraj Sahni), who lives with his wife Parvati 'Paro' (Nirupa Roy) and son Kanhaiya (Rattan Kumar) in a small village that has been hit badly by a famine. After years of drought, the region finally gets rain, leading the farmers to rejoice. Shambu owns two bighas (two-thirds of an acre of land) of land, which is the only means of livelihood for the whole family. The local zamindar (landlord) Thakur Harnam Singh (Murad) partners with some city business men to construct a mill on his large parcel of land, which in return would profit them and bring prosperity to the village. The only problem is that in the middle of Harnam singh's land lie Shambu's meager two bighas of land. Harnam Singh is very confident that he can buy Shambu's land. Shambu has borrowed money from Harnam Singh several times in the past and has not paid his debt. Harnam Singh calls for Shambu and proposes Shambu to sell his land to him in exchange for his debt. Shambu disagrees to sell his only means of livelihood. Angered by the refusal, Harnam Singh orders him to repay his debt by the next day or risk auctioning his land. Shambu returns home to discuss the issue with his father, and with the help of his son, they figure out that the debt amounts to 65 rupees. Shambu wants to save his land by all means and sells all his household items including his wife's gold earrings. When Shambu meets Harman Singh's accountant to pay back his debt of 65 rupees, he's shocked to know that he actually owes 235 rupees. The accountant had forged the accounts and now refuses to consider the labour provided by Shambu's father Gangu as portion of debt payoff. The case goes to court and Shambu, being an illiterate, has a tough time explaining to the judge how the accountant forged the numbers and how he took to the accountant's word of mouth and did not demand any receipt. Shambu loses the case and the judge orders Shambu to pay 235 rupees to Harnam Singh in three months. If Shambu is not able to clear the debt, then his land would be auctioned off and the proceeds would go to pay off his debts. Shambu now struggles to get the money and he is unable to get a loan because he has no collateral. One of his friends gives him an idea to go to Calcutta (now Kolkata) and try to get a job to earn enough money to pay off his debt. Shambu likes this idea, but faces resistance from his wife as she's pregnant and does not want to live away from him. Shambu persuades her that he'll be gone for three months only and it would benefit his family and the soon-to-be-born baby. Kanhaiya wants to join his father too, but Shambu refuses and scolds him. On the train to Calcutta, Shambu finds Kanhaiya hiding and hitchhiking with him and after a brief confrontation agrees to take Kanhaiya with him. In Calcutta, Shambu and Kanhaiya face a harsh welcome. Nobody is willing to talk with them, let alone help them. Kanhaiya befriends a street side shoe shiner named Lalu 'Ustad' (Jagdeep). They even lose their last possessions while they are asleep on the footpath. Kanhaiya falls ill, and Shambu ends up renting a small room in the slums with the help of a tea vendor and the landlady's adopted grandchild, Rani. To pay the rent, Shambu works as a coolie. Shambu befriends an old rickshaw-puller (Nazir Hussain), who helps him to get a license as a rickshaw-puller. Kanhaiya tries to help his family by taking up shoe shining with the help of old rickshaw-puller and Lalu. Back in the village, Parvati and Gangu survive on eating water chestnuts picked up from the local river. She seeks help from Bahu (Meena Kumari) to write letters to Shambu and stay in touch. Near the end of the third month, Shambu becomes aggressive about earning and saving more money. One day, a man asks Shambu to chase another rickshaw that is carrying his girlfriend. Shambu is asked to pull the rickshaw very fast for more money. The rickshaw loses a wheel and Shambu meets with an accident. Looking at the condition of his father, Kanhaiya joins a pick pocketer to earn quick money. Shambu gets angry upon learning this and beats Kanhaiya. Meanwhile, Parvati gets worried since she receives no letters or money from Shambu and the Zamindar's accountant accuses Shambu of forgetting his family. She ends up working at a local construction site and is devastated when she receives the news of Shambu's accident. Finally, Parvati decides to visit Shambu in the city even though Gangu is bed stricken and has high fever. Parvati arrives in Calcutta, and is taken by a strange man, who claims he knows Shambu and will take her to him. He takes her to his shed and tries to steal and force himself on her. She flees from him, but comes under a car. A crowd gathers around her and they call for a rickshaw to take her to the hospital. Shambu who was passing by offers a ride, and is shocked to see his injured wife. Meanwhile, Kanhaiya, unable to withstand his father's condition, steals money from a lady and runs back to the slum. He comes to know about his mother's condition and rushes to the hospital. He cries after seeing his injured mother and claims that God has punished them because he started stealing money. He rips the money into pieces. The doctors tell Shambu that he has to spend money on medicine and blood to save his wife. Poor Shambu has no choice but to spend all his earnings to save his wife. Back in the village the land is auctioned because Shambu could not pay back the debt and Gangu develops a mental disorder. The land is now owned by Harman Singh and the mill construction has begun. Shambu and his family return to the village only to see their land sold and a factory being constructed on it. He then tries to get a handful of dirt from his land, but is stopped by a security guard. The film ends as Shambu and his family walk away from their land. The movie got the name from a famous poem by Rabindranath Tagore, called \"Dui Bigha Jomi\". Bimal Roy distributed the film abroad with the name \"Calcutta \u2013 The Cruel City\". The measurement of Bigha varies from state to state. In Bengal, where the movie is based, 3 bigha is one acre (4,000\u00a0m\u00b2). Therefore, Shambhu owns only 2,700\u00a0m\u00b2. To better prepare for the role, Balraj Sahni actually rehearsed for the role by pulling a rickshaw on the streets of Calcutta. He interacted with many rickshaw pullers and some of them were facing the same situation as portrayed in the movie.",

        "full_text": " Don is a 1978 Indian action thriller film produced by Nariman Irani and directed by Chandra Barot, with music by Kalyanji Anandji and lyrics by Anjaan and Indeewar. The film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Zeenat Aman, Pran, Iftekhar, Helen and Om Shivpuri, Satyen Kappu and Pinchoo Kapoor. It was the third-highest grossing Bollywood movie of 1978, and was classified a golden jubilee by Box Office India. A remake and sequel were released on 20 October 2006 and 23 December 2011, respectively.   In 1978, 'Don' begins, true to its title, as the story of one of the most powerful men in the business of crime. In spite of being on Interpol's Most Wanted list, Don (Amitabh Bachchan) remains elusive to the police. Besides the police, Don makes a few other enemies through his merciless approach to running his organization. Notably, Don kills one of his own men, Ramesh, when Ramesh decides to leave the business. This introduces Don to two new enemies, Kamini (Helen), Ramesh's fiancee, and Roma, (Zeenat Aman) Ramesh's sister. When Kamini seduces Don and attempts to have the police arrest him, her plan backfires as Don outsmarts her and the police in his escape. In the process, Kamini is killed. A shattered, revenge-seeking Roma gets her hair cut short, trains in judo and karate, then enters Don's gang after deceiving them into thinking that she too is on the wrong side of the law. Don is impressed with her fighting skills and allows her to work for him without suspecting any ulterior motive. After years of unsuccessful attempts at nabbing Don, the police finally succeed. Unfortunately, Don dies in the heat of the chase, botching Officer D'Silva's plan to reach the source of all crime\u2014the man Don reported to\u2014through capturing Don alive. D'Silva buries Don's body, ensuring that people believe he may still be alive; the only ones who know of Don's death are D'Silva, the graveyard priest, and his followers. As luck would have it, D'Silva remembers his chance encounter with Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan), a simpleton trying to survive in the hustle and bustle of Bombay in order to support two small foster children, who is an exact lookalike of Don. D'Silva hatches a plan to transform Vijay into Don so he can arrest the rest of the gang. Around the time Vijay \"returns\" to Don's gang as Don under the guise of amnesia, Jasjit (Pran), just released from jail, begins his mission of revenge against D'Silva and his search for his children Deepu and Muni, who had been saved and taken care of by Vijay. Vijay manages to replace the red diary with a blank one, and tells his gang that he is going to take revenge on the DSP, but is actually going there to give him the real diary. Roma goes after him, but Vijay survives the attack and he tries to explain to her that he is not Don, but Vijay. She refuses to believe him at first but D'Silva intervenes and tells her that the man she is trying to kill is indeed Vijay. Roma apologizes to Vijay, and joins him. Vijay hands over the diary to D'Silva. D'Silva reads the diary and discovers that the underworld crime boss, the man Don reported to, is a man named Vardhan, but he is unable to determine Vardhan's identity. Meanwhile, as Vijay learns more and more about Don through his discovery of his diary and Roma's help, he announces to his colleagues that his memory has returned. Celebrations ensue as Don announces his return to the world, but things take a drastic turn when the police raid the celebrations, acting upon Vijay's information, but Vijay's only witness to his true identity, D'Silva, dies in the crossfire, and Vijay is arrested because the police think he is Don. Vijay manages to get the police into taking him to the DSP, who was injured in the raid. A desperate Vijay tries to get a dying D'Silva to tell the police he is Vijay. Unfortunately the DSP succumbs to his injuries and passes away. Vijay is imprisoned. However, he escapes the police truck while on the way to a high-security jail. He begins to fight for himself and tries prove his innocence. Roma, now an ally of Vijay, agrees to do whatever she can to help him. Tangled in a web of confusion where the police refuse to believe that he is Vijay while simultaneously his underworld gang realize that he is indeed not Don, Vijay incites the ire of both the police and Don's right-hand man, Narang. To add to Vijay's woes, the diary that Vijay had handed over to D'Silva \u2013 his last hope of proving his innocence \u2013 is stolen by Jasjit in an attempt to track down his lost children, without realizing that Vijay is the one man who can reunite them. Vijay escapes the clutches of the police and the underworld with Roma's help and returns to his old self though he struggles to prove his identity and innocence. In the process, he also discovers that the Interpol officer R. K. Malik is actually the underworld crime boss Vardhan, who had killed DSP D'Silva, and had also abducted the real R. K. Malik to take his place. After Vijay fights against Vardhan's men Roma ends up getting the diary. One of the gangsters snatches it from her and burns it. The ending reveals that the burnt diary was, in fact, the fake diary, and that Vijay had the real one in order to trick Vardhan. Vijay gives the proof to the police and all charges are put against him. Vardhan is arrested, the real R. K. Malik is rescued, and Vijay returns to his old life, along with Roma, Jasjit, and Jasjit's children. Producer and cinematographer Nariman Irani was in a financial mess when his film Zindagi Zindagi (1972) starring Sunil Dutt flopped. He was in debt for Rs 1.2\u00a0million and couldn't pay the money off on a cinematographer's salary. When he was doing the cinematography for Manoj Kumar's major hit Roti Kapada Aur Makaan (1974), the film's cast (Amitabh Bachchan, Zeenat Aman, Pran) and crew (assistant director Chandra Barot) decided to help him out. They all recommended that he produce another film and that they would participate in its production. They all approached scriptwriting duo Salim-Javed, who gave them an untitled script that had already been rejected by the entire industry.The cinematographer Nariman Irani, while working on Chhailla Babu decided to borrow most of the plot of Chhailla Babu and shared a modified story idea to Chandra Barot,who made the new modified story as the film Don (1978). The script had a character named Don. Bachchan would play Don, and Barot would direct the film. Aman and Pran would play key roles in the film. The film took three-and-a-half years to complete. Before filming was completed, producer Irani died from an accident on the set of another film he was working on. Barot faced budget restraints but received aid. Aman did not take any money for her work in the film. Barot showed the film to his mentor Manoj Kumar, who felt that the film was too tight and needed a song in the midst of the action-filled film, and so \"Khaike Paan Banaraswala\" was added in the film. Don was released without any promotion on 12 May 1978 and was declared a flop the first week. The song \"Khaike Paan Banaraswala\" was actually to be used by Kalyanji\u2013Anandji for the film Banarasi Babu and picturised on Dev Anand, however since the song was not needed, Dev Anand had removed the song from the album. Within a week after adding the song \"Khaike Paan Banaraswala\", the song by itself became a big hit, and by word of mouth spread, so by the second week, the film's fortunes were reversed and the film was declared a blockbuster. The profits from the film were given to Irani's widow to settle her husband's debts. The hit-song \"Khaike Pan Banaraswala\" was choreographed by P.L. Raj. The soundtrack of the film has been composed by the duo Kalyanji Anandji, while the lyrics were written by Anjaan and Indivar. According to film music expert Rajesh Subramanian the song \"Khaike Pan Banaraswala\" was composed by Babla, younger brother of famous music director Kalyanji Anandji. Kishore Kumar and Asha Bhosle received accolades at filmfare for the tracks \"Khaike Pan Banaraswala\" and \"Yeh Mera Dil\" respectively. Don has elements of Shakti Samanta's film China Town (1962) and is apparently inspired by it. The movie had Shammi Kapoor playing the double roles of both a gangster and his lookalike - a common man turned informer. However this film is heavily inspired from Manmohan Desai's Sachaa Jhutha starring Rajesh Khanna. Don was itself remade several times. The film was remade in 2006 as Don starring Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role of Don, Priyanka Chopra as Roma, Arjun Rampal as Jasjit, Boman Irani as D'Silva, and Om Puri as Malik. It was directed by Farhan Akhtar. With some changes in script, the film proved to be one of the highest-grossing films of the year. A sequel to that film, Don 2 was released on 23 December 2011. A sample from the song \"Yeh Mera Dil\" was used by The Black Eyed Peas for their hit song \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\" in 2005. The song won the Black Eyed Peas their first Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, while the composers for \"Yeh Mera Dil\", Kalyanji Anandji, were awarded the BMI Award for being the originators of the melodies used in \"Don't Phunk with My Heart.\" The third season American Dad! episode \"Tearjerker\" uses the 1978 Don theme music in its intro sequence.",

        "full_text": " Don (also known as Don \u2013 The Chase Begins Again) is a 2006 Indian action-thriller film directed by Farhan Akhtar. The film was produced by Ritesh Sidhwani and Akhtar's production company Excel Entertainment. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan and Priyanka Chopra, with Arjun Rampal, Boman Irani, Isha Koppikar, and Om Puri appearing in supporting roles. Don is a remake of the 1978 film of the same name, and follows the titular criminal's look-alike who has been sent on a clandestine mission to impersonate Don after he is wounded in a chase, and to infiltrate the plans of the drug mafia. The soundtrack was composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. In remaking the film from a new perspective, Akhtar wanted to give a contemporary style and treatment to the original film and make a film that he believed would be perfectly suited to modern times. The director later bought the rights and conceived his adaptation as an homage to the original film and its cast and crew, and to the 1970s era in general. He co-wrote the screenplay with his father, Javed Akhtar, who had also written the original script with Salim Khan. He kept the basic plot but introduced some changes that included an international setting and a different ending. Principal photography commenced in Mumbai, before moving to Malaysia, where 80% of the filming was done. The film was released on 20 October 2006, coinciding with the Diwali festive season. The film was generally well received by film critics. A major commercial success, Don grossed over \u20b91.06 billion at the box office and was the fifth highest-grossing Indian film of 2006. It won Best Asian Film at the Neuch\u00e2tel International Fantastic Film Festival. The film was also nominated for nine awards at the 52nd Filmfare Awards, including nominations for Best Film and Best Actor for Khan. A sequel entitled Don 2 was released on 23\u00a0December 2011.   The illegal drug trade based in Kuala Lumpur is booming. A team headed by Deputy Commissioner of Police De\u00a0Silva (Boman Irani) is sent to Kuala Lumpur to target the operations of Singhania (Rajesh Khattar) and capture Singhania's manager, \"Don\" (Shah Rukh Khan). Singhania is one of the two lieutenants of a deceased kingpin; the other is Vardhan, whose whereabouts are unknown. After Don kills Ramesh (Diwakar Pundir), one of his close associates, Ramesh's fianc\u00e9e Kamini (Kareena Kapoor) decides to help the police, but she is also killed. Planning to avenge her brother and his fianc\u00e9e, Roma (Priyanka Chopra) infiltrates Don's gang. Don is injured and falls into a coma while trying to flee from the police. De Silva finds a look-alike named Vijay (Shah Rukh Khan) and asks him so the police can get close to Singhania. Vijay agrees when De\u00a0Silva promises to admit Deepu (Tanay Chheda), a boy Vijay looks after, to a school in Kuala Lumpur. Meanwhile, Jasjit (Arjun Rampal), Deepu's father, just released from prison, plans to kill De\u00a0Silva. Vijay is admitted to hospital, where Dr.\u00a0Ashok Gilwani gives him scars identical to Don's. When Don suddenly dies, the masquerade begins. Vijay, as Don, joins the gang in Kuala Lumpur. De\u00a0Silva asks Vijay to find a computer disc containing details about the cartel and bring it to him. When Vijay finds it, Roma attempts to kill him, but De\u00a0Silva tells her about his plan, and she agrees to help him. Vijay hands over the disc to De\u00a0Silva. When De\u00a0Silva murders Singhania, the police arrive and arrest Vijay. De\u00a0Silva is killed in the shoot-out, which is unfortunate for Vijay because De\u00a0Silva was the only person who could prove that he is not the real Don. Having discovered his true identity, Don's associates turn against Vijay, but he escapes and, to prove his innocence, tries to recover the disc. Jasjit enters De Silva's apartment to wait for him and finds the disc. He receives a phone call saying that if he wants to see his son again, he will have to bring the disc to the men who are holding his son Deepu hostage. When he meets them, he learns that De\u00a0Silva has been alive all along and is actually Vardhan, who was using Vijay to get close to his competitor. After Jasjit escapes with his son, he meets with Vijay and Roma and shares this information. They come up with a plan. Jasjit arranges a meeting with Vardhan, but the trio have informed the police. Vardhan is arrested, and Vijay is acquitted. Roma confesses her love for Vijay. It is revealed that the real Don was alive all this time, and was pretending to be Vijay. While in the hospital, Don had recovered quickly from his injuries, and had overheard Vardhan/De\u00a0Silva's conversation with Vijay. After Vijay's operation, Don had gotten up from the room at a moment when Vardhan and Dr.\u00a0Ashok were absent and gone to the room where Vijay lay. He had switched places with Vijay and taken Vijay off life support, causing him to die. It is also revealed that the disc Don had given to the police was fake. Now, with both Vardhan and Singhania removed from his path, Don becomes the master of the entire Asian drug dealing ring. The cast is listed below: Farhan Akhtar conceived the idea to remake the iconic 1978 film of the same name after listening to a remixed version of a song from the original film. In early 2005 media reported that Akhtar was planning the remake, but rather than confirming the news, he revealed that he was writing the screenplay based on the film but would make the decision whether to proceed only after completing the script. The director co-wrote the film with his father, Javed Akhtar, who had also written the original film with Salim Khan. Akhtar revealed that the reason behind the remake was a desire to give a new treatment to \"a fantastic film which he enjoyed watching as a child\", and create an adaptation that he thought would suit modern times. Akhtar said, \"Don is the one film from that time that in my mind lends itself to being remade today. For me, it is a film that back then was a little ahead of its time. I don't say so technically\u00a0\u2013 not the way it was shot, or the sets, or whatever. But the way the story was told, the language the characters spoke, the writing style there was, it was very modern even for its time. So today, when you adapt it, it fits very easily into a contemporary space. I think it fits into the modern sensibility of movie viewing.\" Additionally, he wanted to pay tribute to the stars and makers of the original film, the 1970s era in general, and the films made by Salim-Javed and Amitabh Bachchan. In order to suit the modern sensibility, several changes were introduced. Akhtar changed a number of aspects of the climax as he felt the original ending was outdated for today's audiences. On being asked about several changes in the films, the director said it was important to adapt the film in a way would suit the sensibilities of the modern viewer. On the other hand, a number of elements from the original were retained in the new film, notably the background score, two songs, some dialogue, and some situations, all of which Akhtar believed were fine in the original, saying that not including them would be a crime. Akhtar initially wanted Hrithik Roshan for the titular character, after having worked with him on their previous film Lakshya (2004). However, Akhtar felt that the character required a more mature actor, saying he wanted \"a face that had seen the world and roughed it out\". The director said that Roshan's innocence was not right for the role, and instead he cast Shah Rukh Khan for the part that had been portrayed by Amitabh Bachchan in the 1978 film. Akhtar believed that Khan was the most suitable for the role, saying, \"He has the personality, the style, the flair, the larger than life persona, the sense of humour and the sheer magnetism that this character requires\". In July 2005 Priyanka Chopra was cast to play Roma, a role originally played by Zeenat Aman. Akhtar found Chopra to be perfect for the role, saying, \"There is a docile sensuality about her which suits the character\". When he offered the role to her, she was excited to play the character and immediately agreed to do the film. Later that month Arjun Rampal and Isha Koppikar joined the cast. While Rampal was cast as Jasjit, played by Pran in the original, after Akshay Kumar turned down the role for being secondary, Kopikar was cast in a completely new role that was not in the original film. In August 2005 Kareena Kapoor was confirmed to appear in the song \"Yeh Mera Dil\", which had been performed by Helen in the original film. Khan, Chopra, and Rampal underwent extensive martial arts training from an expert from Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in different kinds of martial arts. Khan revealed that he had always wanted to look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if she would be able to do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a conscious effort to give her own look and style to the character. This was Chopra's first action role, and she was excited to the part, so she wanted to do all the stunts by herself. After Chopra decided to perform her own stunts, Akhtar revealed that he was happy as it gave him the scope to film the fight sequences from different angles. Rampal, in the role of Jasjit, said that he approached his character in a way similar to how Pran had played it in the original but with an emotional graph. Boman Irani, who plays DCP De\u00a0Silva, a role performed by Iftekhar in the original film, revealed that he played the role according to what suited the script, but retained some of the dignity from that film. Principal photography commenced in February 2006 in central Mumbai. Art direction was handled by Aradhana Seth, and the costumes were designed by Aki Narula. Akhtar chose K. U. Mohanan to handle the cinematography after having been impressed by his work in documentaries and commercials. This was Mohanan's first Hindi film as a film cinematographer. To give an authentic feel to the film, scenes were shot on a closed set in actual chawls in real locations. The film was also shot at Film City and Yash Raj Studios. Some filming was done in Paris in March over a three-day schedule. The filming moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in April 2006 where the majority of the film was shot. 80% of the filming was done in Kuala Lumpur and Langkawi. In Malaysia, filming was done over the course of seventy days at 42 locations including KLCC, Kampung Baru, and Penchala Link, and included more than thousand extras, all of whom were selected following auditions. Additional filming was done in Singapore. Apparently, the former Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad, who had previously declined even Hollywood films to be filmed in the Petronas Towers, gave his permission for the crew to film inside his personal office in the Towers. For a scene depicting a media ambush, several real-life journalists from India and Malaysia were hired. The song \"Yeh Mera Dil\" was shot by Farah Khan. Veteran choreographer Saroj Khan agreed to choreograph the new version of the popular song \"Khaike Paan Banaras Waala\", which had been choreographed by her mentor P L Raj in the original film. The song was filmed in Malaysia on 13\u00a0May 2006 with Khan and Chopra. The dancing for other songs was choreographed by Prabhu Deva, Ganesh Hegde, and Rajeev Surti. Hollywood technician Angelo Sahin, the special Effects supervisor behind Mission Impossible (2000), and aerial stunt co-ordinator Joe Jennings, known for his work in films such as Charlie's Angels (2000), were hired for the action sequences. The soundtrack was composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar. The album contains eight songs: three original, two remakes of from the original film, a theme, a reprisal, and a remix of one of the three new songs. The vocals were performed by Shaan, Sunidhi Chauhan, Shankar Mahadevan, Alisha Chinai, Mahalakshmi Iyer, Sonu Nigam, and MIDIval Punditz. It was released on 26\u00a0August 2006 by T-Series. The soundtrack received favourable reviews from music critics, who praised \"Aaj Ki Raat\", calling it \"innovative\" and the best song on the album. The recreation of songs from the original film, \"Ye Mera Dil\" and \"Khaike Paan Banaraswala\", received mixed comments. Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave the album a 4 out of 5, noting its success at surprising its listener, and wrote \"Shankar Ehsaan Loy do exceedingly well with the soundtrack and establish their supremacy as the composer trio who can give their own even while rearranging the songs from the past.\" Planet Bollywood gave a rating of 6.5 out of 10, praising its lyrics and vocals, and termed \"Aaj Ki Raat\" as \"the best song in the entire soundtrack\". Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com was less impressed with the album, calling it \"Snazzy, good mix\" and writing \"This lavish enterprise has a little bit of everything. An eclectic mix of old, new and everything in between; Don is an unusual presentation of old wine in new bottle.\" The Don soundtrack album was the first Indian soundtrack to be released on iTunes on the same day of its launch or before the public release of physical copies. The music topped charts on a number of platforms in India. It was one of the best-selling Bollywood soundtracks of the year, with 1.5\u00a0million units sold according to Box Office India. The song \"Aaj Ki Raat\" was used by A. R. Rahman in his Grammy and Academy Award\u2013winning soundtrack Slumdog Millionaire (2008). Being a remake of an iconic film, and the starcast involved, Don was one of the most anticipated films of the year. The first look poster was released in late April 2006, which according to the media hinted at the kind of adaptation the film was going to be. This was followed by another poster in late July 2006, which also revealed the release date of the film. Following the poster reveals, the theatrical trailer was released in mid-September. Bollywood Hungama deemed it promising, writing that the \"trendy accessories, sleek gadgets, lavish settings, expensive wardrobe and deadly action scenes build the framework of the new Don.\" To promote the film, the filmmakers teamed up with Hungama Digital Media Entertainment to launch a Mobile game based on the film. It was the first Multiplayer online game launched for any Bollywood film. The filmmakers also launched popcorn holders of Don before the release film. An 80-page comic book was published and copies were given for free in multiplexes along with the tickets of the film. In December 2005 UTV acquired the overseas rights of the film. Made on a budget of \u20b9380 million, Don was released worldwide on 20\u00a0October 2006 in 800 screens during the Diwali festive season, clashing with another high-profile Bollywood film Jaan-E-Mann. The film opened to excellent to very good response at the domestic box office, with an occupancy of 90 percent. After a first day opening of \u20b946\u00a0million, the film grossed \u20b9141\u00a0million on its opening weekend. It also received a good opening in overseas markets with an opening weekend of over $2.2\u00a0million. On its opening weekend, the film grossed over \u20b9302\u00a0million worldwide. After its first week, the film took in more than \u20b9244\u00a0million in India. The film grossed $1.1\u00a0million in its first week in UK, while the total overseas first week earnings were more than $4.1\u00a0million. The film grossed \u20b9529\u00a0million worldwide at the end of first week. The film had a very good hold in its second week, and performed extremely well, even better than that week's new release and collections increased in several centres, with setting new second week highs. After its theatrical run, the film grossed over \u20b97100\u00a0million in India, becoming the fifth highest-grossing Indian film of 2006, and was deemed a \"hit\". It also grossed over $7.8\u00a0million in the overseas territories and was declared a blockbuster. Worldwide, the film grossed over \u20b91.06 billion (US$16\u00a0million) and was a major commercial success. Distributed by T-series Home Entertainment domestically and Internationally by UTV, the film was released on DVDs on 5\u00a0December 2006 across all regions in a two-disc Collector's Edition pack in NTSC format, with several bonus content such as making of the film, bloopers, trailers, deleted scenes, and clap track. It also included a \"Don Comic Book\". A steel case limited edition DVD was released in January 2007 with the same bonus features. The VCD version was released at the same time. A single-disc DVD pack was also released later. The Blu-ray version was released on 27\u00a0April 2011. Upon release, Don was generally well received by critics. Mayank Shekhar from Mumbai Mirror gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5 and wrote, \"The former was a character-driven, intimate film, albeit a fairly slick thriller, mostly for its screenplay. The latter is a most updated Indian film of the action genre that always calculably concentrates on the new twists, and the turning points, both of which mostly seem cleverer than contrived; ably fitting pieces, the known characters, into a new domino.\" Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave a mixed review, saying that the film was \"conventional and predictable\", and complained that the director did not develop his characters. However, Sen was impressed by Chopra's performance, calling it \"film's biggest surprise\", and wrote, \"Stepping into Zeenat Aman's shoes is a tough task, but she doesn't really waste time pretending to be the stunner's successor. Chopra handles her role with efficiency, looking every bit the competent woman of action\u00a0\u2013 and a ravishing babe who fills out a skintight white jumpsuit deliciously. Roma is a hard part to play, but Priyanka has a no-nonsense air about her throughout the film. This is an actress willing to push herself, and has definite potential for screen magic. Not to mention a great smile.\" Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph gave the film a positive review, noting that the director turned a formula \"good defeats bad\" film into a modern-day neo-noir film where \"bad fights bad\", and wrote, \"The new Don is more of a remix than remake with the scratchy edges smoothened out with grunge grooves and blistering beats. Farhan changes the backdrop and the background and yet manages to keep the original sequences and lines.\" Gupta also praised the acting, \"eye-catching locations\", cinematography, and production design, and thought that the \"breathtaking chase and action sequences\" broke new grounds on Indian screens. Bollywood Hungama's Taran Adarsh rated the film a 3 out of 5, praising the performances of the lead actors and writing \"Shah Rukh Khan does very well as Don. He enacts the evil character with flourish. But he fails to carry off the other role [Vijay] with conviction. It looks made up, it doesn't come natural to him at all. Priyanka Chopra carries off her part with 'lan. The stunt [when she rescues Khan] is bound to win her laurels.\" Planet Bollywood gave a rating of a 7 out of 10, particularly praising the twist ending, and wrote, \"The Don of the 21st century is stylish with flaws, yet, you do enjoy the experience of watching it in the cinema.\" While labelling the film a \"disappointment\", film critic Sukanya Verma questioned Akhtar's decision behind remaking such an important film. She further criticised Akhtar for taking a fairly simple but engaging storyline, strangling it mercilessly, and turning it into a shockingly unimaginative adaptation. Verma also found Khan to be inconsistent in the dual roles; however, she praised Chopra's portrayal of Roma, and wrote, \"The seriousness with which Priyanka Chopra plays Roma is rather notable. She is a picture of restrained toughness and bubbling seduction.\" Giving a 1 out of 5, film critic Rajeev Masand panned the film, terming it an exercise in indulgence, and wrote, \"Spiffily shot and stylishly packaged, the new Don may wear a new look, but what it's clearly lacking is the raw energy, the unpredictability of Chandra Barot's original thriller.\" A sequel entitled Don 2, also directed by Akhtar, was released on 23\u00a0December 2011. Khan, Chopra, Irani, and Puri reprise their roles as Don, Roma, De\u00a0Silva alias Vardhan, and Malik, respectively.",

        "full_text": " Dostana (Friendship) is a 2008 Indian romantic comedy film directed by Tarun Mansukhani and produced by Karan Johar and Hiroo Yash Johar. The film stars John Abraham, Abhishek Bachchan and Priyanka Chopra, with Bobby Deol, Kirron Kher, Sushmita Mukherjee and Boman Irani in supporting roles. Dostana tells the story of two men who pretend to be gay to share an apartment with a girl; eventually, both fall in love with her. Mansukhani, who conceived the film as a tale of three friends living together, was inspired by his own experience. Wanting to add something different to the script, he later decided to introduce homosexuality (which he thought was unexplored by Bollywood) to shed light on the issue for the Indian audience. Manish Malhotra designed Chopra's costumes, and Aki Narula designed costumes for the rest of the cast. The soundtrack was composed by Vishal-Shekhar and Anvita Dutt Guptan; Kumaar and Vishal Dadlani wrote its lyrics. Principal photography took place in Miami, Florida over a two-month period in the first half of 2008. Dostana was the first mainstream Indian film with a gay element and has been credited for exploring a topic largely ignored by most of the Indian population. The film was released on 14 November 2008 to positive reviews, with praise for its performances, direction, music, costumes and style. A box-office success, grossing over \u20b9871 million, it was the eighth-highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. Dostana received nine nominations for the 54th Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Best Actor (Bachchan), and Best Music Director. The film was influential in creating fashion trends in India, with Chopra's silver sari (worn in the song \"Desi Girl\") becoming popular. Abraham's yellow trunks, Chopra's golden swimsuit and the actors' looks and style received considerable attention and were popular with youngsters. Dostana is regarded as one of the most stylish and trend-setting of Indian films, with Filmfare ranking it first in a 2013 poll.   Sameer \"Sam\" Kapoor (Abhishek Bachchan) and Kunal Chopra (John Abraham) are fun-loving, womanising bachelors in Miami. Sam (a male nurse) is often kidded about skirt-wearing, and Kunal is a fashion photographer. They first meet at a friend's place after a night out with girls, and run into each other again when they are interested in renting the same apartment. The apartment belongs to Neha Melwani (Priyanka Chopra), who works for Verve. She lives there with her aunt (Sushmita Mukherjee), who refuses to sublet the apartment to either of them since Neha wants girls as flatmates. After meeting a gay soldier, Sam persuades a reluctant Kunal to pretend that they are lovers so they can rent the apartment. They regret their decision when they meet Neha, since they are attracted to her. The three become good friends, and Sam and Kunal fall in love with her. Neha's gay boss, Murli \"M\" (Boman Irani), resigns as Verve's editor and must choose his successor. To impress him (and hopefully get the job), Neha invites him for dinner at her house and asks Sam and Kunal to entertain him. A US government agent visits them for a surprise inspection and joins the party. Chaos ensues when Rani (Kiron Kher), Sam's mother, arrives to check on him after she receives a letter from the US government at her home in London approving his application for a domestic partnership with Kunal. M later concludes that Sam and Kunal are a couple and not single, as he initially thought. At Neha's office the following day, M announces that Abhimanyu \"Abhi\" Singh (Bobby Deol) will be the new editor. Neha, upset at being passed over for promotion, goes home and is consoled by Rani; in turn, she helps Rani accept her son's sexuality. Kunal and Sam help Neha with a project assigned by Abhi, who is impressed with her work. They later take Neha on separate dates, both telling her that they love her. Neha, convinced that they are gay, sees the dates as friendly outings. When Abhi and Neha begin dating, Sam and Kunal sabotage the budding relationship by giving Abhi inappropriate advice; this irritates Neha, and she and Abhi quarrel. When Neha discovers Kunal and Sam's plan, she misinterprets it as jealousy of Abhi. Sam and Kunal redirect their efforts into frightening Veer, Abhi's five-year-old son, about his future with Neha. During a basketball game, Neha discovers that Abhi plans to propose to her and asks Kunal and Sameer's advice. They ask her to turn him down, admitting that their homosexuality is a ruse and they both love her. Veer tells Abhi about his fears, and during the game Abhi breaks up with Neha. She tearfully evicts Kunal and Sameer from her apartment, and resigns from Verve. A few months later Kunal and Sam meet in court, where they are picking up residency permits. Recognising the value of their friendship with Neha and each other, they reconcile. They find Neha at a fashion show and try to apologise, but she refuses to see them. Unaware of Neha and Abhi's break-up, they ask about the wedding and Neha tells them about Veer's fears. Kunal and Sam admit that they manipulated the boy, angering Neha and Abhi. Kunal and Sam climb onto the stage and beg Neha's forgiveness. The crowd encourages them to beg on their knees, say that they love her and blow her kisses, but nothing softens her. When the crowd tells them to kiss each other, they refuse. Neha and Abhi turn to leave, and Kunal kisses a reluctant Sam. Abhi is amazed and Neha impressed by the lengths to which they will go to regain her trust, and she forgives them. Kunal and Sam, desperate for Neha's happiness and friendship, get down on their knees and propose to Abhi on her behalf. Amused, Abhi agrees. Two months later, Neha playfully asks Kunal and Sam if they felt anything for each other when they pretended to be gay; they say \"no\", remembering their kiss. During the production of Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), Tarun Mansukhani conceived a film about three friends who share an apartment. After the production wrapped, Karan Johar told him that Mansukhani was ready to direct a film and should write a script; if Johar liked it, he would produce the film. He set the film in Miami, since he liked its lifestyle and culture: \"People in Miami work hard and party harder and I wanted to capture that in my film.\" Mansukhani worked for eight months on the script; Johar liked it, and asked him about the cast. In an interview, Manuskhani described Dostana as a story of \"how the three strangers come together, live together in an apartment and have their moments of happiness and sorrow.\" The director was inspired by his own experiences: \"The germ for that comes from my own childhood memories of school-time friends. I have lived in boarding school for most of my childhood and the friends that I have today are the ones whom I got in touch with during 4th/5th standard. I may not speak to them for years but they are a family whom I can call up at 4 am without hesitation.\" Manuskhani soon realised that Bollywood had explored friendship, live\u2013in relationships, marriage and divorce many times, and he wanted to do something different for his debut film. He decided to use sexuality to shed light on the issue, untouched by Bollywood, for the Indian audience. Mansukhani later added the gay storyline because he thought it was an issue that needed to be touched on. However, the director did not want the film to be serious or preachy: \"I also realise that when you preach via cinema nobody wants to hear it\". \"The film has a message, if you get it, great. If you don\u2019t, no problem, sit back, relax and enjoy the film\", he said about making Dostana a romantic comedy. In February 2008, Johar announced the film's title; the producer named it after a 1980 film produced by his father, Yash Johar. Asked if his film was also a love triangle, he replied: \"Well, yes and no. Though it's a love story, there's a never-before twist in the tale. All I can say on record is that we've never had a love triangle like this before.\" The gay storyline was not disclosed until the trailers were released. Manan Sagar was hired to edit the film, and Salim-Sulaiman wrote the background score. Abhishek Bachchan, John Abraham and Priyanka Chopra were cast in the lead roles. Aishwarya Rai was originally offered the lead role, but she turned it down because she did not want to end up with another man in her first film with her husband (Bachchan) after their marriage. After Dostana's release, she regretted the decision. Saif Ali Khan turned down the role of Kunal because he was uncomfortable with a husband and wife (Bachchan and Rai) playing the other two leads. In early April 2008, Shilpa Shetty was signed for a featured song in the film. Bachchan said that Sam was his most difficult character to play, and he worked hard on his gestures and mannerisms: \"I had to work very hard to portray a straight man acting gay. It could easily have gone over-board. I wanted to avoid making the character caricatural [sic]. Barring one portion ... we kept it controlled.\" Bachchan and Abraham, who had gained weight for their earlier films, had to lose the weight and become more muscular. Although Chopra agreed to wear a swimsuit, she refused to wear a bikini. The actress said that that she did not lose any weight (as the media speculated), but worked out for a toned look in her films; she was also filming Fashion (2008) at the time. According to Chopra, \"For 'Fashion', I had to put on six kilos and later had to shed chip by chip as the character progressed in the film. My body structure in 'Dostana' is more toned than in 'Fashion' as it is a completely beach film. I've worked very hard on my body.\" Manish Malhotra and Aki Narula designed Dostana's costumes (Malhotra for Chopra and Narula for the rest of the cast). It was Malhotra's second time working with Chopra; the first was for Andaaz (2003). Since the film was set in Miami, he decided on a holiday look; Chopra's character, a fashion editor, would wear stylish, chic clothes. The actress had \"a lot of shorts, tank tops, tees, formal jackets and bikini tops\", and her wardrobe had a \"beach vibe.\" Malhotra gave her a very young, \"girlie\" look. He designed clean lines with lots of colours, toning down Chopra's accessories: \"You will notice that none of her dresses have any embroidery or designs either. All her outfits are mainly in satin, chiffon and georgette.\" The designer gave Chopra shorts and singlets with loose silhouettes. Malhotra said that although the actress prefers grey, black and white, he decided to experiment with bright solid colours like \"the ones in the citrus family.\" Chopra was initially apprehensive about the colours, but Malhotra changed her mind: \"Priyanka has worn colour like never before in this film. There\u2019s lime, tangerine, cranberry, pink, yellow, purple ... the rainbow.\" He wanted to design the swimsuit in a metallic gold or silver; he and Chopra settled on gold because of her dusky skin, which they thought a perfect foil for the colour. The golden swimsuit was created by combining two swimsuits; because they were small, Malhotra attached the second one to make the swimsuit seen in the film. Although Johar and Mansukhani wanted Chopra to wear a gown for the song \"Desi Girl\", Malhotra suggested a sari. They considered it unsuitable for a character in Miami, but Malhotra said that if they could do a song like \"Desi Girl\" in Miami Chopra could wear a sari and \"treat it like a dress\". They later agreed on the sari, Chopra's only Indian costume in the film. Malhotra designed a modern sari, giving it a Western feel with a long, silver-sequined skirt and a bikini-type blouse. The designer chose silver because only a silver sari could compete with the golden swimsuit. Unfamiliar with Miami culture, Aki Narula spent time there before filming began to learn how Miamians dressed and gave Bachachan long cargo shorts and cotton shirts in bright colours. According to the designer, the most interesting parts of his styling were the matching scarves, which resembled extended shirt collars. Narula gave Bachachan cargo and embroidered pants and sunglasses. The embroidery, primarily dragons and palm trees, conveyed a tropical summer look. Narula gave Abraham (who plays a fashion photographer who works and lives on the beach) cargo and boxer shorts, trunks for swimming scenes, and jerseys and football shorts in windcheater fabrics. He also gave him flip-flops, canvas shoes and T-shirts with slogans such as a \"Use A Condom\", which the designer considered important. Malhotra and Narula collaborated on the colour pallete: \"If Manish would give Priyanka yellow, then I would go for a green for John and a pink for Abhishek.\" Narula also designed for Deol, Irani, Kher and Mukherjee. He chose brands such as Dolce & Gabanna and Gucci for Deol (the Verve editor), giving him sleek suits with short jackets and skinny pants with narrow bottoms. Kirron Kher, who played Bachchan's mother, was styled as a typical Punjabi salwar-kameez-clad woman with gota embroidery. For Sushmita Mukherjee, who played Chopra's aunt, Narula chose animal prints and diamonds, pearls, silver and gold: \"When we shopped for her it was like 'oh god, this is so tacky let\u2019s buy it or oh, I hate it. It\u2019ll be fabulous'\". Principal photography took place over a two-month period from mid-March to May 2008 in Miami. Dostana's art director was Amrita Mahal. Mahal assisted Sharmishta Roy for four years, worked with her on Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna and became friends with Tarun Mansukhani. When Mansukhani asked her to work on his directorial debut, she jumped at the opportunity. Three large sets were created for the film in Miami: the apartment, the Verve office and the \"Desi Girl\" set. Smaller sets had simple floor plans. The types of houses in Miami were researched, and Mahal described them as \"large and spacious compared to cramped apartments in New York.\" A three-bedroom apartment with an outdoor pool was created, and the bedrooms were designed to suit their occupants. After toying with colours for the Verve office, Mahal decided to make it black and used four colours for the apartment. Her team gave the furniture a Victorian look; Mahal was pleased with the chandeliers, which she considered lavish for an office. Construction of the \"Desi Girl\" set, the last to be built, was stressful because of its light-generated heat. Over 100 sketches were drawn to reach the final version, which used plaster of Paris, moulding fibre and wood. A dance floor was surrounded by tables and chairs for a stage-like appearance. Ayananka Bose was the film's cinematographer. According to Bose, its location was the big factor in his work: \"Dostana is based in Miami and to me Miami means sunshine and beaches. That is what stayed in my mind.\" Bose chose a bright frame because the film was a comedy about friendship, and the bright frame conveyed vibrancy: \"That is what automatically gave Dostana its expression.\" He found the office set challenging, since there was nowhere to put lights and the room had glass on one side and a wall on the other. However, Bose enjoyed filming on the apartment and office sets. \"Desi Girl\" was choreographed by Farah Khan, and Vaibhavi Merchant choreographed the other songs. The item number \"Shut Up & Bounce\" was shot in Miami in early April 2008; \"Desi Girl\", with the three lead actors, was filmed in September. Filming ended with a music video, a remix of \"Ma Da Laadla\", which appears in the closing credits. The video was shot in mid-October 2008 at Filmistan Studio in Mumbai, where the lead actors filmed their scenes separately. Dostana's soundtrack was composed by Vishal-Shekhar. Anvita Dutt Guptan wrote the lyrics for three songs, and Kumaar wrote two songs. In addition to composing the soundtrack and providing vocals on four songs, Vishal Dadlani wrote the lyrics for one. The album, which contains six original songs with vocals by Vishal Dadlani, Shankar Mahadevan, Sunidhi Chauhan, Master Saleem, Shreya Ghoshal, Amanat Ali and Shaan, was released on 30 September 2008 by Sony Music. It received positive reviews from music critics. Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama rated the soundtrack four out of five, calling it an \"excellent album\": \"There is not one single number which doesn't work. In fact if three soft numbers 'Kuch Kum', 'Khabar Nahi' and 'Jaane Kyun' are the pick of the lot, then 'Desi Girl' is a definite must for the dance floors. 'Maa Da Laadla' and 'Shut up & Bounce' have their own place under the sun.\" Planet Bollywood rated the album eight out of ten and called it Vishal-Shekhar's best album of the year: \"Whether it be through the touching vocal, musical, and lyrical poetry of Kuch Kum, Vishal's riveting vocal performance in Jaane Kyun, the soothing depths of Khabar Nahin, or the uplifting, feel-good breeze of Desi Girl, Dostana has music for everyone to savor.\" Hindustan Times also gave it a positive review, calling it \"a surefire chartbuster.\" According to CNN-News18, \"Except for 'Shut Up and Bounce', each song in Dostana is wrapped in fun and peppiness on the one hand and melody and rhythm on the other.\" Stills from Dostana released to the media in late July 2008 were well-received, and the film's first trailer was released in mid-August. The trailer received considerable attention because of the film's gay storyline (a first in mainstream Indian film), which was kept secret during production. Its trailers, music and style attracted advance publicity, aiding the film's marketing. The producers promoted Dostana in collaboration with Verve, which dedicated its November issue to the film. The issue, with Chopra on its cover, contained 40 pages of interviews with the actress, Mansukhani and Johar, fashion shoots on the sets, clothing by its designers and fashion and beauty articles based on the film. Although Maybelline products were not used for Chopra's make-up, the company promoted Chopra's appearance with behind-the-scenes footage in their television and print advertisements and invited its customers to mirror the actress. The producers teamed up with Facebook, which featured ads with each of the three lead actors urging users to form their own group. Pantaloons partnered with the film to showcase its apparel in 43 outlets across India. Made on a \u20b9400-million budget, Dostana was released on 14 November 2008. The film opened well, with over 80-percent occupancy in multiplexes and over 60-percent occupancy in single-screen cinemas. According to Box Office India, the film earned about \u20b953 million on its opening day and over \u20b9173 million in its first weekend at the domestic box office. At the end of its first week, it had earned \u20b9267 million. In its second week, Dostana continued to do well and was the best-performing film despite the release of Yuvvraj. The film was considered a hit in its second week. It also performed well in the overseas market, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States. Dostana grossed \u20b9261 million on the overseas market and over \u20b9610 million at the domestic box office for a worldwide gross of over \u20b9871 million. The film, a commercial success, was the eighth-highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. Distributed by Yash Raj Films, it was released on DVD on 30 December 2009 in all regions in a two-disc pack. The DVDs include bonus content on the making of the film, deleted scenes, the music video for \"Maa Da Ladla\", bloopers, \"Date with Dostana\" (an interview segment presented by Karan Johar), a \"Do the Dostana\" challenge, a theatrical trailer and ads. A VCD version was released at the same time, and a single-disc DVD was also released. The film's Blu-ray version was released on 14 December 2009. Dostana received mainly-positive reviews from critics, who praised its performances, the chemistry between its three leads and its music, costumes and style. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 90 percent based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1 out of 10. A review in The Guardian praised Taran Mansukhani's direction and writing, calling it a \"a straight victory for gay comedy\": \"India's convoluted attitude to gayness finally has its cinematic manifestation in Dostana, one of the gayest films ever made in any country but in which almost no one is actually gay. It's also a terrific movie - the best and funniest Bollywood film I've seen in a very long time.\" Describing the film as a \"decent-hearted comedy\", Rachel Saltz of The New York Times wrote: \"Dostana deserves credit. It irreverently normalizes a topic that has been virtually absent from screens in India, and does so using contemporary Bollywood\u2019s best not-so-secret weapon: star power.\" David Chute of LA Weekly called it \"a pure star vehicle, gliding along on charm and timing \u2013 exactly the sort of comfort cinema Hollywood now seems incapable of making.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film a four-out-of-five rating and called it a madcap comedy which dared to \"push the envelope in its own way\": \"Dostana is a winner all the way. In terms of content, it might just prove to be a trendsetter.\" The Times of India also rated it four out of five: \"It introduces the most outrageous scenes in popular Hindi cinema and manages to get away with it because it's all done with an infectious zest and effervescence that keeps the ribs tickling.\" Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph rated the film 7.2 out of 10, writing that Dostana \"can make you laugh out loud and also strike an emotional chord.\" Raam Tarat of Future Movies rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praising its performances (\"The lead actors share a great chemistry, are easy on the eye and oh so charming that they, along with beautiful Miami make for a visual treat\") and calling it \"a great, fun entertainer with lots of charm and great music.\" For Hindustan Times, film critic Khalid Mohamed gave Dostana a three-out-of-five rating: \"Good taste, pop colour Miami locations, high-end costumes, make-up styling and the A-grade Dharma Productions values add up to a zingy entertainer\". Rajeev Masand also gave the film a positive review, calling it \"a barrel of non-stop laughs\": \"It puts the fun back into the movies. You laugh harder than you have in a long time. It\u2019s a film with a one-point agenda \u2013 to entertain you while you\u2019re in your seat. It achieves that, no two ways about it.\" Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu noted that Dostana \"largely reflects a society in transition and begins to address the issues of acceptance within the Indian framework of marriage\": \"Dostana is great mass entertainment manipulating the inherent homophobia of a country on the threshold of change, but what\u2019s significant is that it will bring parents and children together to share laughs over alternative sexuality and related issues that will no longer remain in the closet.\" Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave the film a mixed review. Although he found it \"genuinely entertaining\", he was disappointed with Dostana's treatment of homosexuality. According to Sen, it would set \"an already-fragile mindset of Indians\" a decade back in its attitudes: \"We in India haven't yet matured to sensitive, normalised portrayals of homosexuality, and this film continues to paint them as freaks of nature.\" Dostana was the first mainstream Indian film to explore homosexuality. The film has been credited with shedding light on a topic sensitive with a majority of Indian population, who were unaware of alternative sexual orientations. A Screen article called it a \"giant leap for the gay people in Indian films\", and the film sparked debate. According to a Bollywood Hungama report, \"The fact that it is a mainstream film with two mainstream heroes taking the plunge to the extent of even showing a prolonged smooch and courtship should have the pink brigade cheering.\" Indian journalist and LGBT-rights activist Ashok Row Kavi praised Dostana: \"I am glad, for the first time in Indian popular cinema, gays were not turned into caricatures and made fun of. What the film has done is to bring to notice gays as a concept in [the] Indian family.\" Its depiction of a homosexual character's acceptance by his mother was seen as encouraging acceptance of gay people. According to a Daily News and Analysis article, \"gay talk\" went mainstream in Bollywood with the film: \"Films like Dostana are playful and funny [and] bring sexuality as a dinner-table conversation piece. Bollywood is open to diversity in terms of subjects, including sexuality, and the audiences are ready to accept diversified subjects\". About the gay-rights movement, Namita Bhandare of Mint wrote that Dostana \"will also shatter more glass ceilings, make homosexuality a little less taboo and bring conversation about gays and sexual orientation out in the open\": \"Here\u2019s a film that is made within the parameters and, therefore, limitations of mainstream cinema. The two lead actors aren\u2019t gay; they only pretend to be gay. But despite these limitations, the film brings homosexuality out of the fringe and into the drawing room\". Karan Johar said that after Dostana's release, he received thousands of emails from \"kids, youngsters [and] teenagers\" thanking him for making the film because their parents are now aware of homosexuality. In a 2016 interview, Johar said: \"There was once a point when we weren\u2019t even aware. People criticised me for stereotyping homosexuality in Dostana. It's ridiculous how unaware people were before. The film, at least, brought the conversation [about] homosexuality into the drawing room of every urban home.\" Before Dostana's release, its style and fashions received considerable attention. Chopra's golden swimsuit and Abraham's yellow trunks were noticed by the public, the media and fashion critics. The film influenced fashion trends in India, with its stars' costumes becoming popular (particularly Chopra's silver sari in \"Desi Girl\"). Her sari's popularity encouraged designer Manish Malhotra to carry varieties of it in his store. Bachachan's floral shirts were popular with youngsters and college students, and Chopra's look was mirrored by the public. Dostana ranks among the most stylish Indian films of all time, and was voted Most Stylish Film by Filmfare in 2013. Bollywood Hungama also ranked it the most stylish Bollywood film of all time.",

        "full_text": " Dosti (English: Friendship) is a 1964 Indian black-and-white Hindi film directed by Satyen Bose and produced by Tarachand Barjatya under his Rajshri Productions banner. It was Sanjay Khan's debut film and had Sudhir Kumar Sawant, and Sushil Kumar Somaya in lead roles. The film focuses on the friendship between two boys, one blind and the other a cripple. Dosti was amongst the top 10 grossers of 1964 and was declared a \"Super Hit\" at the box office. It was entered into the 4th Moscow International Film Festival.   Dosti is the story of Ramnath or Ramu (Sushil Kumar) and Mohan (Sudhir Kumar). Ramu\u2019s father Mr Gupta, a factory worker dies in an accident. When the factory refuses to pay compensation, his mother passes out in shock by falling from the stairs. Ramu is injured in an accident and he becomes crippled. Thrown out of his home, crippled and penniless, he roams around the streets of Mumbai. Here he comes across Mohan, a boy who is blind and has a similar tale of woe. Mohan comes from a village. His sister, Meena had migrated from the village to Mumbai to find work as a nurse so that she could pay for her brother\u2019s treatment. Mohan left the village after his caretaker died. Ramu is good at playing the harmonica, while Mohan is a good singer. They team up and sing songs on the roadside and start earning money from passers-by. Ramu wants to finish his studies, and both of them befriend a small girl, Manjula (Baby Farida), who is the sister of a rich man, Ashok (Sanjay Khan). Manjula suffers from Rheumatoid Heart Disease and both the boys hope she would help them out. Ramu and Mohan visit Manjula and ask for a loan of sixty rupees which is the amount required for Ramu's admission in school. But Manjula's brother rebuffs them and gives only five rupees. Feeling insulted, Mohan decides that he will raise the money by singing, which he successfully does. Ramu is admitted in the school after performing brilliantly in entrance test (he scores 294 out of 300). They move to a new house in a slum after someone tries to steal their hard earned money while they were sleeping on footpath. Their new neighbour is Mausi, who lives with her teenage daughter and school going son, Nandu. Mausi treats them as her own sons. In school, Ramu excels in studies despite being a regular target of ridicule of richer students who do not consider him their equal and often degrade him for being a \"street beggar\". The headmaster and teacher Sharma ji takes Ramu under their wings. Sharma ji also declared himself guardian of Ramu. During a visit to Ramu's house, Sharmaji notices that the neighbourhood is not fit for study and suggests that Ramu move in with him but Ramu does not leave Mohan. Meanwhile, one day while singing, Mohan hears someone (Ashok) calling out to Meena and rushes to embrace his long lost sister. But Meena is ashamed that Mohan has become a beggar and refuses to recognise him. Meena is looking after Manjula and there is a budding romance between her and Ashok. However, soon Meena confesses to Ashok. Ashok is sorry for her and consoles her that soon she will be together with her brother. Mohan senses Manjula while sleeping and tells Ramu about it. Both decide to go and meet her, but she died. Ashok brings Mohan home one day and gives him Manjula's chime as her remembrance. When he tries to tell Mohan about Meena, Mohan lashes out in rage and says that he considers himself alone in this world, save for his friend Ramu. Soon after, Ramu gets in trouble with some ruffians and as a result is mistakenly arrested by police during a burglary. Sharma ji goes to police station and bails out Ramu on the condition that he will live with Sharma ji and keep no contact with Mohan. Mohan is heartbroken and decides to visit him. But Sharma ji didn't allow him to talk to Mohan. Sad, Mohan roams the streets singing sad songs. Sharmaji suddenly dies, leaving Ramu shattered. Ramu decides not to appear for the final exam as he cannot pay the fees. Hearing this, Mohan decides to raise the money once again by singing in streets in spite of his ill health. He successfully earns the money and pays the fees without Ramu knowing, but himself falls prey to illness and is admitted in hospital. In hospital, without telling him, Meena cares for Mohan as he recuperates. Ramu comes first in the exams and comes to know of Mohan's sacrifice. He rushes to Mohan in hospital to ask for forgivness where Mohan says that he was never angry with him. The doctor tells Mohan about Meena and he forgives her. The movie ends with all of them in a loving embrace. The lyrics of the film are written by Majrooh Sultanpuri on music composed by Laxmikant Pyarelal. Dosti stands as a landmark in the career history of the musical duo as this won them their first Filmfare Award and made them popular in the film industry. Mohammad Rafi is the main vocalist for the songs. Dosti collected Rs. 2 crore in the Indian box office and stood as third highest grosser of 1964. The first and second weekend collection was excellent. The film stood out at the 12th Filmfare Awards in 1965 by winning six awards from seven nominations that it received. Dosti won maximum awards at the ceremony.",

        "full_text": " Ek Duuje Ke Liye (English: (We Are) Made For Each Other) is a 1981 Hindi romantic tragedy movie directed by K. Balachander, starring Kamal Haasan and Rati Agnihotri. It was a remake of the director's own Telugu movie Maro Charitra (1978), which had Kamal Haasan playing the lead role. The film was labelled a \"blockbuster\" at the box office in 1981, earning a total of \u20b9100 million (US$1.5\u00a0million) in receipts. The film featured lyrics penned by Anand Bakshi and music by Laxmikant-Pyarelal. It received critical acclaim upon release, winning a National Film Award and 13 Filmfare nominations, eventually winning three.   The movie is about the love between a Tamil man, Vasu (Kamal Haasan), and a North Indian woman, Sapna (Rati Agnihotri), who are neighbours in Goa. They come from totally different backgrounds and can hardly speak the other's language. Their parents despise each other and they have regular skirmishes. When Vasu and Sapna admit their love, there is chaos in their homes, and their parents reject the idea. As a ploy to separate the lovers, their parents impose a condition that Vasu and Sapna should stay away from each other for a year. After such a period, if they still want to be together, they can get married. During the year there should be no contact between them whatsoever. Vasu and Sapna reluctantly agree to the condition and decide to separate. Vasu moves to Hyderabad, and they both initially suffer due to the separation. Vasu then meets Sandhya (Madhavi), a widow who teaches him Hindi. Meanwhile, Sapna's mother brings a family friend's son, Chakram (Rakesh Bedi), to Goa to distract Sapna from to Vasu, but she is not impressed. At a chance meeting in Mangalore, Chakram lies to Vasu that Sapna has agreed to marry him. Vasu is upset and decides to marry Sandhya on the rebound. However, Sandhya comes to know of Vasu's real love and goes to Goa to know the exact situation and to clear the misunderstanding between the lovers. Vasu then returns to Goa and impresses Sapna's parents with his Hindi. When Vasu goes to meet Sapna he is attacked by a group of goons hired by Sandhya's brother (Raza Murad). Meanwhile, Sapna is raped by a librarian (Sunil Thapa) at a temple and is left to die. The movie ends tragically when Vasu and Sapna commit suicide by jumping off a cliff. Ek Duuje Ke Liye marked the debut of three stars from South India in Hindi films: leading lad Kamal Haasan, leading lady Rati Agnihotri and playback singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam. Three of them received Filmfare nominations becoming top stars in Hindi films later except Kamal. The only person who was missing in the Hindi remake who was in the original Telugu film Maro Charitra (1978) was leading lady Sarita, as her role was now played by Rati Agnihotri. Director K. Balachander, Kamal Haasan, Madhavi, and S.P. Balasubrahmanyam all repeated their artistry in the Hindi version. The music was composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal and the lyrics were written by Anand Bakshi. It was the first Hindi film for South Indian singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam; the music directors were initially against including him, feeling that the \"Madrasi\" would not do justice to a Hindi composition, but Balachander cited that if the lead character played by Haasan could not speak Hindi well, then even if Balasubrahmanyam blemished the song, it would \"capture the character.\" Two portions of \"Tere Mere Beech Mein\" were later sampled in the hit 2004 Britney Spears song \"Toxic\" as part of its hook.",

The screenplay was by Sriram Raghavan and Pooja Ladha Surti. It was premiered at the New York Asian Film Festival.   Karan is a rich, suave businessman. But he can also be very possessive of Sarika. His temper can flare at slightest pretext. After Karan involves Sarika in looking after a suitcase full of illegal firearms belonging to his friend, a hitman, she is arrested for having links with the underworld and is remanded to judicial custody. Karan claims innocence to her and sends her a defense attorney to fight her case. The attorney advises her to confess the crime, arguing that there is no proof exonerating her. After being convinced that the judge will give her a light sentence and might even set her free for co-operation, Sarika complies. But, the judge sentences her to seven years hard labour without parole. Sarika then realizes that Karan is an associate to the underworld and that he had her framed to keep police eyes away from him. This realization is soon followed by the death of her father, the ongoing ordeal of prison life and hatred towards Karan. She beats up an abusive inmate Gomati who constantly bullies her. An elder inmate Pramila (Pratima Kazmi), who has contacts outside the prison, decides to help her. Sarika undergoes a complete change of appearance. Sarika changes from inside and outside which begins with her getting rid of her fear of rats. ACP Malti Vaidya (Seema Biswas) sets out to find Sarika after she escapes from prison. She first confronts Mathur, killing him after learning Karan's whereabouts. She is angered to see Karan enjoying his life with a new girl. With the news of Mathur's mysterious death, Karan becomes a suspect. Karan soon learns that Sarika has escaped but is not able to put two and two together. Sarika learns that Karan is working for a businessman (Abhay Bhargava) who has many illegal operations under his garb. After she kills the businessman's brother, Karan gets trapped as he was the last man to see the person alive. Karan is shocked at the development but chalks it to the work of rival gang. Meanwhile, Sarika pretends to run into him. She pretends to have sympathy for him. Seeing that she still has not seen through his game, Karan decides to play with her for some time. Karan confronts a man whom he suspects to be a traitor, but he believes that somebody else could have sneaked in after Karan went out. Before the man can say anything, Karan kills him, too. Sarika is amused as Karan gets entangled in a cat-and-mouse game. She steals money from Karan's boss, for which Karan is again made a patsy. However, Karan soon realizes the plot. After he confronts and assaults her, she shocks him by telling him that she has burnt the money. Karan takes her to his boss and makes her confess at gunpoint. But she feigns ignorance and claims that Karan made her say so. As Karan is attacked by his boss's goons, he breaks into a fight. Just then, the ACP enters with the police. In a shootout, the ACP succeeds in killing Karan's boss. The gang is either killed or apprehended. While the ACP herself gets shot, Karan succeeds in escaping. His success is short-lived: suddenly, Sarika emerges from his back and holds him at gunpoint and makes him drive to a secluded spot. After knocking him out, she chains him in a cavern infested with rats. As Karan regains consciousness, Sarika tells him how she used to be scared of rats and she chose this spot because she wanted him to go through the pain and suffering that she went through while she was in prison. Karan is baffled at her talk, but she leaves him in the cavern, with light from a flashlight pointing towards him. Karan screams, but nobody hears as he is in a secluded place. Soon the flashlight goes out and Karan loses strength. The rats attack and kill him brutally (shown by dimming of lights and screams). Karan dies a long and painful death. With her mission of exacting revenge from Karan accomplished, Sarika eventually surrenders to the police, turning in the bag of money that she stole from Karan's boss to the ACP. The film ends showing Sarika spending the rest of her life in prison.",

        "full_text": " English Vinglish is a 2012 Indian comedy-drama film, written and directed by Gauri Shinde. The film's narrative revolves around a housewife who enrolls in an English-speaking course to stop her husband and daughter mocking her lack of English skills, and gains self-respect in the process. The protagonist, played by Sridevi, was inspired by Shinde's mother. English Vinglish was originally made in Hindi; later it was re-shot in Tamil and released along with a Telugu dubbed version on 5 October 2012. The film marked Sridevi's return to filmmaking after a 15-year hiatus; it features French actor Mehdi Nebbou, Adil Hussain, and Priya Anand. Amitabh Bachchan and Ajith Kumar had cameo appearances in the Hindi and Tamil versions respectively. Before its theatrical release, English Vinglish was premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, where both the film and Sridevi's performance received positive response. Prior to its release, the film was screened for the Indian press and critics. It received critical acclaim and several critics hailed it as a \"must watch film\". Soon after its release, the film was declared a hit in India and overseas. English Vinglish swept all the Best Debut Director awards of 2012 for Gauri Shinde. The film was also shortlisted as India's official entry for the Academy Awards in Best Foreign Language Film category. The film earned global acclaim at several international festivals across the world and Sridevi was hailed as the 'Meryl Streep of India' and the \"female Rajinikanth in Japan\".   Shashi Godbole (Sridevi) is a housewife who makes and sells laddoos as a home-run business. Her husband Satish (Adil Hussain) and daughter Sapna (Navika Kotia) take her for granted, mock her poor English skills and generally treat her with disrespect, making Shashi feel negative and insecure. However, her young son, Sagar (Shivansh Kotia) loves her as she is, and her mother-in-law (Sulabha Deshpande) offers her words of sympathy. Shashi's older sister Manu (Sujatha Kumar), who lives in New York, invites Shashi's family to her daughter Meera's (Neeju Sodhi) wedding to Kevin (Ross Nathan). It is decided that Shashi will go to New York alone to help Manu organize the wedding, and her husband and children will join her as the wedding approaches. During her flight to New York, Shashi is given inspirational advice by a fellow passenger (Amitabh Bachchan in Hindi/Ajith Kumar in Tamil). While Shashi is in New York, she has a traumatic experience at a coffee shop due to her inability to communicate in English, but is comforted by the shop's French chef Laurent (Mehdi Nebbou). Using the money she made from selling laddoos, she secretly enrolls in a conversational English class that offers to teach the language in four weeks, showing her resourcefulness at navigating an unfamiliar city alone. The class comprises: David Fischer, the instructor (Cory Hibbs); Eva, a Mexican nanny (Ruth Aguilar); Salman Khan, a Pakistani cab driver (Sumeet Vyas); Yu Son, a Chinese hairstylist (Maria Romano); Ramamurthy, a Tamil software engineer (Rajeev Ravindranathan); Udumbke, a young African-Caribbean man (Damian Thompson); and Laurent. Shashi quickly becomes a promising and committed student, earns everyone's respect with her charming behavior and her cuisine, and gains self-confidence. Laurent becomes attracted to Shashi. When he tries to kiss her at the rooftop of a building, Shashi rejects him and runs off, but fails to explain that she is married. Meanwhile, Shashi's niece Radha (Priya Anand) who is Meera's younger sister finds out about her secret English classes and is supportive of her pursuit. Shashi starts watching English films at night and does her homework assiduously. To complete the English-speaking course and get a certificate, each student must write and deliver a 5-minute speech. Shashi's family joins her in New York earlier than planned, to surprise Shashi. Shashi tries to continue attending class, but decides to quit because of scheduling conflicts, and asks Radha to inform Fischer. The test date coincides with that of the wedding, and Shashi is forced to miss the test. Radha invites Fischer and the entire class to the wedding, where Satish is taken aback at being introduced to a diverse group of people by his wife. Shashi gives a touching and enlightening toast to the married couple in English, surprising everyone who knew her as a typical, conservative, Indian housewife. In her speech, Shashi extols the virtues being married and having a family, describing the family as a safe space of love and respect where weaknesses are not mocked. Satish and Sapna regret treating her with disrespect. Fischer declares that she has passed the course with distinction and issues her the certificate. Shashi thanks Laurent for \"making her feel better about herself\". Shashi's family return to India; during their flight home, Shashi asks the flight attendant in fluent English whether she has any Hindi newspapers. The story was inspired by Shinde's mother, a Marathi-speaking woman who ran a pickle business at her house in Pune. Her mother was not fluent in English, which embarrassed Shinde as a child. In an interview, Shinde said, \"I made this film to say sorry to my mother.\" The film started development in 2011 or earlier, and several plot points and cameo appearances were decided early on. The film garnered much media coverage because of Sridevi's comeback after nearly fifteen years away from film production. The film rights were sold to Eros International for \u20b9200 million (US$3.1\u00a0million). The film also marked the Bollywood debut of South Indian actress Priya Anand, who previously worked in the Tamil and Telugu film industries.

The first preview of English Vinglish was launched on 14 June 2012. The official distributor Eros International posted the preview video and poster on YouTube and Twitter. A two-minute teaser showing Sridevi reading out the Censor Certificate of the film in deliberately broken English was also released. The preview received positive response and was lauded for its unique and fresh concept. The full theatrical trailer was unveiled at a special media event on 13 August 2012 coinciding with Sridevi's birthday. The trailer also received a positive response and went viral on YouTube, exceeding one million views within a week of its release.

In July 2012, English Vinglish was selected by the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) and scheduled for a world premiere at the coveted Galas section of the festival.

Writer and critic David D. Levine praised the film, saying \"[t]hough it's not a musical, strictly speaking, there's quite a bit of music and dance, and the film is laugh-out-loud funny and heart-rending by turns\u00a0...\u00a0My favorite film of this PIFF. Five stars out of five.\" In April 2013, English Vinglish was selected to play at the third Beijing International Film Festival and the International Film Festival of Panama.

Owing to the film's box-office success and critical acclaim, the premiere was conducted as a mega event; Zee TV arranged a special press conference attended by Sridevi and Gauri Shinde, and to publicise the premiere, the channel launched a free English-speaking module telephone service using IVRS, which was an overwhelming success with over 25,000 calls across India in less than a week.

Zee Cinema formed partnerships with Cafe Coffee Day, Inox, Fame, Lifestyle, Shoppers Stop, Globus and Westside to aggressively market the premiere. Mohan Gopinath, Business Head of Zee Cinema said, \"More than two generations of India have worshiped Sridevi. Add to that an extremely simple yet heart-warming narrative, some spot-on direction by Gauri Shinde, Balki's unmistakable touch and you have a winner on your hands.\" The worldwide gross for English Vinglish stood at \u20b9750 million (US$12\u00a0million) at the end of its third week, and reached \u20b9850 million (US$13\u00a0million) by the end of fourth week.

        "full_text": " Fanaa (English: Destroyed in Love) is a 2006 Indian romantic crime drama film, directed by Kunal Kohli and produced by Yash Raj Films. The film stars Aamir Khan in an anti-hero role, Kajol as his blind love interest, and Rishi Kapoor, Tabu and Sharat Saxena in pivotal roles. Aamir Khan plays the role of a tourist guide in New Delhi who goes by the name Rehan \"Khan\" and Kajol plays a blind Kashmiri woman, Zooni Ali Beg. Both fall in love, but are separated by a terrorist attack that reportedly kills Rehan. It is later revealed that Rehan was not killed, but is in fact a Kashmiri insurgent, and the mastermind behind the attacks. Seven years later, his organization, known as the \"IKF\", sends him on a mission in Kashmir, where he once again, in a strange fate, meets Zooni. Fanaa was one of the most expensive Bollywood films during its time of release. The film's title is derived from the Islamic Sufi term \"fanaa\", meaning Fanaa means Nihilism \"destroyed\" in Arabic, Persian, Urdu, and Hindi. Khan and Kajol were put into a romantic pairing for the first time with this film. It also marked the comeback of Kajol, who was last seen in Karan Johar's Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001), and it was the first time Aamir Khan worked under the Yash Raj production banner. It was released in Malaysia on November 26, 2006. The film was banned in the state of Gujarat due to protests against the lead actor Aamir Khan for his comments criticizing the Gujarati government.   Zooni Ali Beg (Kajol) is a blind Kashmiri woman who travels for the first time with a dance group to New Delhi to perform in a ceremony for Republic Day. On her journey, she meets Rehan Qadri (Aamir Khan), a Casanova tour guide who flirts with her. Although her friends warn Zooni about him, she cannot resist falling in love. On her last night in Delhi, Rehan and Zooni spend the night together and end up in bed. As Zooni is leaving the next day on a train, Rehan comes in and takes her away with him. Her parents arrive in Delhi to marry them. Zooni has a procedure done that helps her see again, but when she comes out of surgery, she finds out that Rehan was killed in a bomb blast in the city, and is heartbroken. She is taken to the hospital mortuary, and told to identify his body. As Zooni cannot see anybody there, she is quickly made aware of the sweater that Rehan was wearing which she knitted for him covered in blood and soot. Meanwhile, Malini Tyagi (Tabu) is a special intelligence agent brought in to assess the threat of the bomb blast and the group responsible, an independent organization fighting for an independent Kashmir known as IKF. She believes it is the work of one man who is helping IKF. It is revealed that the man is Rehan, who placed the bomb blast in motion, then faked his death so Zooni wouldn't come looking for him. He privately admits that he loves Zooni, but also concedes that he can never see her again because of his dangerous life. Seven years later, Rehan is on an Indian army camp on another mission for the IKF. IKF has acquired a nuclear weapon but needs to get hold of the trigger, which is in the army's possession. Rehan manages to steal it, but Tyagi has figured out his plan and sends forces to stop him. In the ensuing shootout, Rehan is injured severely. He makes his way to a remote house looking for help. The door opens, and it turns out to be Zooni's house. It's also revealed that Zooni had given birth to Rehan's son after Rehan's supposed death. Zooni and her father manage to save Rehan, though neither knows his real identity. Though initially distant from them, Rehan develops an affection for his son and becomes friendly towards Zooni and her father. Rehan eventually reveals his true identity to them. Initially hurt, Zooni refuses to let Rehan leave her again, and the two of them are married by her father. Tyagi has a report published about Rehan, warning the public that he is a dangerous terrorist. Zooni's father sees this report, and realizes that it's Rehan. He holds him at gunpoint, but Rehan thwarts him and manages to get the trigger back. In the process, though, he accidentally throws Zooni's father off a ledge, killing him. He radios the IKF from an army officer's house describing his position. However, the officer discovers Rehan, who then kills the officer. Zooni finds her father's body later, and when she tries to tell Rehan, he covers. However, Zooni later sees the news report, and finds the trigger. She takes her son and the trigger, and goes to the officer's house. When she finds blood there, she radios for help, and gets in touch with Tyagi, who tells her to stop Rehan at any cost. Rehan arrives at the house the next day, and tries to convince Zooni to hand over the trigger. He takes it from her, saying the IKF will kill her and their son if he doesn't. Zooni, though, follows him outside and shoots him in the leg. Rehan draws his gun on Zooni, but can't bring himself to shoot her. Zooni shoots him again to stop him. Tyagi arrives and stops the IKF from shooting Zooni. Rehan dies in Zooni's arms. Zooni and her son later visit the graves of both her father and Rehan, who are buried next to each other. When the son asks if his father was wrong, Zooni tells him that his father did what he thought was right. Both tell Rehan that they love him before leaving. The performances from the leads, Aamir Khan and Kajol, as well as their on-screen chemistry were praised. The film grossed an estimated \u20b9725 million in India and \u20b9316 million overseas markets, for a worldwide gross of approximately \u20b91.04 billion. Fanaa was originally planned to be shot in Kashmir before the lead actress backed out due to the continuing insurgency in that region. The director chose to move the Kashmir segment to the Tatra Mountains in southern Poland, which also provides suitably snowy and mountainous terrain. It was filmed at historical locations in Delhi including the Red Fort, Jantar Mantar, Qutub Minar, Purana Qila, Rashtrapati Bhavan and Lodhi Gardens. While promoting his film in Gujarat, Aamir Khan made some comments regarding the Gujarat chief minister's handling of the Narmada Dam and the necessity to rehabilitate the displaced villagers. These comments were met with outrage from a political party BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party). The government of Gujarat demanded an apology from Khan. Khan refused to apologise, saying \"I am saying exactly what the Supreme Court has said. I only asked for rehabilitation of poor farmers. I never spoke against the construction of the dam. I will not apologise for my comments on the issue.\" An unofficial ban of Fanaa was put in place for the entire state of Gujarat. Protests occurred against the film and Khan which included the burning of posters of the star in effigy. As a result, several multiplex owners stated that they could not provide security to customers. Thus, all theatre owners in Gujarat refused to screen the movie. Producer Aditya Chopra moved a petition to the Supreme Court of India asking them to direct the Gujarat government to provide protection to all cinema halls that wanted to screen the film, but it was rejected. Their response was that if a cinema was concerned for their protection they could call on the police. Addressing the media, director Kunal Kohli said, \"All theatre owners or exhibitors who wish to release this film can request for protection and the government should extend support. We as filmmakers request all theatre owners of Gujarat to come forward and release the film. We have earned 470\u00a0million (both domestic and overseas) in the first week and have lost approximately 6 to 70\u00a0million of business in Gujarat. However it's not about money... it is about a principle. As a democratic country where Aamir has a right to say what he feels, even the people of Gujarat, who are protesting have the right to say what they feel\u00a0... but in a democratic fashion, and not by burning posters and threatening people.\" A single privately owned cinema in Jamnagar, Gujarat, screened the movie with police protection despite the threats. It ran for over a week before being withdrawn again following a self-immolation bid by a man protesting against the screening. The man, Pravin Joshi, entered the bathroom of the theatre during intermission of one of the screenings and set himself on fire. He suffered 85% burns and succumbed to his wounds nine days later. The music of Fanaa was composed by Jatin-Lalit with lyrics penned by Prasoon Joshi. Five songs are featured in the movie while the soundtrack contains seven songs. This was the last movie for which Jatin-Lalit composed as a duo (they split afterwards). Gaurav Sathe of Planet Bollywood gave 8 stars stating, \"Jatin-Lalit's last offering doesn't give us a Dilwale Dulania Le Jayenge or a K3G, but it is still a notch higher than some of the run-off-the-mill music we've been hearing as of late.\" Aamir Khan and Kajol recite lines of poetry in \"Chanda Chamke\" and \"Mere Haath Mein\".

        "full_text": " Fan is a 2016 Indian psychological, action thriller directed by Maneesh Sharma and featuring Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role. The film is produced by Aditya Chopra under the banner of Yash Raj Films, and tells the story of an obsessive fan of a star who looks just like the star. The soundtrack album and original score are composed by Vishal\u2013Shekhar and Andrea Guerra respectively. The film was released on 15 April 2016. Made on a budget of \u20b9850 million, the film collected \u20b9792.5 million in India and \u20b9613.5 million from overseas territories. The film also released in South Korea on 23 February 2017.   Gaurav Chandana (Shah Rukh Khan) is a Delhi-based die-hard and obsessive fan of Bollywood superstar Aryan Khanna (also Shah Rukh Khan); Aryan is Gaurav's whole life. Gaurav's face bears an uncanny similarity to Aryan's, which helps him win the local talent show competition impersonating Aryan. He then embarks on a journey to meet Aryan in person. When Sid Kapoor (Taher Shabbir Mithaiwala), a fellow actor, expresses harsh sentiments about Aryan to the press, Gaurav gets furious and invades Sid's cabin. He holds him hostage, beats him, and makes him apologise to Aryan while he records it. The video is uploaded to the internet, where Aryan sees it. He considers Gaurav's actions a crime and gets Gaurav arrested. In jail, Gaurav is mercilessly beaten, and Aryan comes to meet him. Gaurav is delighted, but Aryan angrily reprimands him and declares that Gaurav is not his fan. He reveals that he was the one who got Gaurav arrested, and tells him to forget they ever met. Shattered and disillusioned, Gaurav returns home and burns all of his Aryan memorabilia, vowing to get revenge against Aryan for turning his fan away. One year later in London, Gaurav heads to Madame Tussauds wax museum, impersonating Aryan and purposely creating a havoc situation in which he triggers the police. The real Aryan is then arrested despite declaring that he is innocent. Aryan is bailed out and departs to Dubrovnik for a show. He gets a call from Gaurav, who warns him to apologise or he will destroy Aryan's stardom. Gaurav disguises himself as a crew-member to get into Aryan's show; though Aryan instructs his personnel to look out for him, they fail to catch him. Aryan is next scheduled to perform at a billionaire\u2019s wedding. Gaurav poses as Aryan and molests the billionaire's daughter. The billionaire berates the real Aryan and makes him leave the event. Outside, Aryan spots Gaurav and gives chase, though Gaurav escapes. The molestation incident gets all over the news, resulting in a tarnished reputation and fans boycotting Aryan's shows. In a press conference, Aryan explains that someone else is impersonating him and asks for time so he can prove his innocence. Back in India, Gaurav invades Aryan\u2019s home and vandalises his trophy collection. Aryan visits Gaurav's parents and meets Neha, Gaurav's crush. He then devises a plan to impersonate Gaurav and declare his love to Neha at the local talent show. This provokes Gaurav, who shoots at Aryan with a gun. Aryan chases him and subdues Gaurav after a bloody fight. He asks Gaurav to stop this and live his own life. Gaurav says that his life is nothing without Aryan and flings himself off the roof, dying with a smile. A horrified Aryan watches him fall. Aryan\u2019s name is cleared from all the controversies, but the ordeal still haunts him. On his next birthday, when he goes out to the roof to greet his fans, Aryan sees a hallucination of Gaurav smiling up at him. On 16 December 2013, Yash Raj Films announced the project with Shah Rukh Khan as the main lead and Maneesh Sharma as the director. On 25 March 2014, it was announced that Greg Cannom is going to develop the look of Khan in the film. Khan underwent 3D scanning for his look as a young boy. Though it had at one time been reported that Khan was scheduled to play a 17-year-old boy in the film, Khan later denied the claim. Principal photography of the film began in July 2014. The film was shot in Mumbai, Croatia, London and Delhi. The film is the first ever to be shot at the Madame Tussauds in London. On 7 August 2015, it was announced that the filming of the project was completed. Fan was scheduled to release in early 2015, but owing to the injuries sustained by Khan during the filming of Happy New Year, the film's release date was postponed to 14 August 2015. The post-production work involving complex visual effects pushed the release of Fan once again to early 2016. After several delays, the film released on 15 April 2016 in 3500 screens in India and around 1100 screens abroad. It was produced on a budget of \u20b9850 million (US$13\u00a0million) and an additional \u20b9200 million (US$3.1\u00a0million) was spent on publicity, for a combined cost of approximately \u20b91.05 billion (US$16\u00a0million).

He pulls off a terrifically dramatic double act, altering his look, feel and intensity, but as Gaurav, Shah Rukh makes you forget everything \u2013 except feeling scared.\" Mid Day also saw the film worthy of 4/5 and reviewed, \"Right from the beginning of this thriller, which undoubtedly boasts of one, oops, two of his best performances, it is evident why Shah Rukh Khan is needed for a film of this sort, and why only someone in his position and with his caliber could do it too.\" Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and opined, \"On the whole, FAN has a brilliant first half, but loses track in the second hour, only to pick up again towards the pre-climax. The writing should've been tighter, but what works is the terrific act by SRK as the fan.\". The Hindu called the film Khan's return to form and said, \"SRK couldn't have found a better vehicle than Fan, both as an actor and as a celebration of the highs and the lows of his own stardom. A stardom whose enormity he'd himself find difficult to wrap around his head.\" The Indian Express also gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated, \"Fan is a triumph. Shah Rukh Khan is played to all his strengths, and he plays it just right, gliding in and out of the star and the fan, creating distinct identities and outlines in one scene, and blurring the lines just so in the next.\" India Today gave the film 3.5 stars as well and commented, \"Maneesh Sharma and Shah Rukh Khan hand-deliver the mindscape \u2013 of both the fan and the star \u2013 on screen. And brilliantly.\" Hindustan Times also rated it 3.5 out of 5 and went on to say, \"Though Fan is irrational at times, it keeps the adrenaline pumping all 143-minutes of the movie. Also, the idea of keeping it a song-less film works because that keeps the overdramatic tone from seeping in.\" NDTV Movies gave the film 3 stars on 5 and opined, \"Fan works for the most part because it has the fabulous SRK act as a 'young' star-struck boy. His energetic performance is worth the price of the ticket \u2013 if not more.\"",

        "full_text": " Fashion is a 2008 Indian drama film directed and co-produced by Madhur Bhandarkar. The film's screenplay was co-written by Ajay Monga, Bhandarkar and Anuraadha Tewari, and principal photography occurred in Mumbai and Chandigarh. Its music was composed by Salim-Sulaiman and the songs' lyrics were written by Irfan Siddiqui and Sandeep Nath. The film features Priyanka Chopra in the lead role as Meghna Mathur, an aspiring fashion model; it follows her transformation from small-town girl to supermodel, the Indian fashion industry and the careers of several other models. Fashion also explores feminism and female power in Indian fashion. The film also stars Kangana Ranaut, Mugdha Godse, Arjan Bajwa and Arbaaz Khan in supporting roles. The cast also features several professional fashion models playing themselves. Development of the film began in 2006. The film's budget was \u20b9180 million (US$2.8\u00a0million); it opened on 29 October 2008 to positive reviews. Critics praised its screenplay, cinematography, music, direction and performances. It collected \u20b9600 million (US$9.3\u00a0million) at the box office and was commercially successful despite being a women-centric film with no male lead. Fashion was nominated for several awards. At the 54th Filmfare Awards, the film received seven nominations including Best Director and won two awards; Best Actress award for Chopra and Best Supporting Actress award for Ranaut. It also won Best Actress award for Chopra and Best Supporting Actress award for Ranaut at the 56th National Film Awards. Several publications listed Fashion as one of the \"best women-centric films in Bollywood\".   Aspiring model Meghna Mathur (Priyanka Chopra) wants to go to Mumbai and become a supermodel. Against her father's wishes, Meghna leaves her home to find success in the modelling world. Meghna meets an old acquaintance, Rohit (Ashwin Mushran)\u2014a gay, aspiring designer who assists Vinay Khosla (Harsh Chhaya). Meghna experiences difficulties during her early days; she auditions several times and is rejected. Meghna meets and befriends another struggling model, Maanav (Arjan Bajwa). At Rahul Arora's (Samir Soni) fashion show, Meghna meets supermodel Shonali Gujral (Kangana Ranaut) and is ridiculed by the show's choreographer, Christine, and told to have her portfolio photographed by Kartik (Rohit Roy). To afford Kartik's fees, Meghna shoots a lingerie advertisement; she is mentored by another aspiring model, Janet (Mugdha Godse). Meghna's lingerie photos appear on the cover of a magazine; her relatives in Mumbai see the cover and ask her to leave the house. She moves into an apartment with Maanav. Meghna is noticed by Anisha Roy (Kitu Gidwani), an executive at Panache, a major modeling agency. Anisha introduces her to her superior, Abhijit Sarin (Arbaaz Khan), who is impressed by Meghna's ambition and confidence. Panache's top model is Shonali, but her drug abuse becomes problematic. Abhijit includes Meghna in a fashion show organised by Vinay Khosla, but is replaced after a misunderstanding. Abhijit consoles her, and decides to replace Shonali with Meghna as Panache's new top model. Meghna becomes an overnight success, ends her relationship with Maanav and begins an affair with Abhijit. Meanwhile, Janet goes to work for designer Rahul Arora. Rahul's mother becomes increasingly concerned about his sexual orientation so he asks Janet to marry him. Shonali's drug abuse worsens and she attends a rehabilitation clinic. Meghna pays the price of her increasing fame by losing her close friends due to her changed attitude towards them. She becomes pregnant with Abhijit's child, and reluctantly has an abortion due to conditions in her contract. After realizing that she was deceived in her relationship, Meghna tells Abhijit's wife about their relationship, and Abhijit ends Meghna's contract with Panache. Upset at the turn of events, Meghna descends into alcoholism; at a rave party she uses cocaine and unwittingly has a one-night stand. When sober, she feels guilty and returns to her parents in Chandigarh. Broken and depressed, Meghna lives in Chandigarh for over a year. Her father encourages her to return to Mumbai; Meghna rekindles her friendship with Janet and models for Rohit's show, where she freezes on the ramp after seeing the lights and cameras. She visits Maanav (now an established model) to apologize and learns that he is engaged. Shonali appears on television as a mentally ill, homeless alcoholic; Meghna takes her in and tries to rehabilitate her. Meghna accepts an offer from Rahul to model, but a day before the show Shonali vanishes. Just before Meghna walks the ramp, she receives a call from the police telling her that Shonali is dead from a drug overdose. Meghna freezes; overcoming her grief, she walks the ramp, reviving her career and restoring her self-confidence. Meghna gives up drinking and smoking, and as the film closes she walks the ramp in Paris. In a 2006 interview with CNN-IBN, Madhur Bhandarkar said that he was preparing to make a film about the fashion industry; he thought the lack of Indian films on this subject prompted him to do so. He said he was fascinated with the industry, the models and their lives outside the ramp walks, saying \"I was amazed at the overwhelming attention given to the fashion Industry by the media and the public. I thought the idea of delving deep into the fashion world was very interesting and intriguing.\" He was excited about depicting the people behind the ramp because most people are unfamiliar with the fashion world. Bhandarkar, who is known for studying his subject matter to make his films as realistic as possible, researched the fashion industry for nearly eight months, attending fashion events and shows. He spoke with designers, buyers, choreographers and models. Several media publications reported that the film was inspired by the lives of fashion models such as Shivani Kapur, Geetanjali Nagpal, Kate Moss and Alicia Raut; however, Bhandarkar stated that the story is fictional and does not resemble anyone's life. The media also reported that the film revolved around two homosexual fashion designers; Bhandarkar denied these rumours, saying the film did not revolve around male characters but had female protagonists. Casting began in October 2007, when Priyanka Chopra signed to play the lead role in the film. Chopra initially refused the role, feeling she would not be able to do it justice. Six months later, she agreed to appear in the film because of Bhandarkar's confidence in her. The media reported that Chopra was unhappy with the first draft of the film and wanted script changes before signing the film. Bhandarkar was also unhappy with the first draft and agreed to rewrite the script. Kangana Ranaut was cast as the film's second lead; she was pleased with the script and found it challenging, interesting and exciting. In December 2007, Arbaaz Khan and Arjan Bajwa were cast opposite Chopra. After confirming the principal cast, the media reported that Bhandarkar was having difficulty casting the male roles, including that of a homosexual clothing designer. Samir Soni and Harsh Chhaya were cast as the homosexual designers, and model Mugdha Godse was cast in a supporting role. According to Godse, Bhandarkar offered her a part when they were shooting a jewellery advertisement; a year later, she agreed to appear in the film. The Hindustan Times said that several models and designers played themselves, giving the film the appearance of a documentary. Chopra said she studied method acting to make her character seem real. The actress said that her character is determined and added, \"While her father wants her to become an accountant she aspires to become the leading model in fashion industry\". Addressing rumours that the film was an expos\u00e9 of the fashion industry, she said, \"It is nothing like that. Whatever problems that come up to my character in the film are not because of the profession but because of the choices that my character makes in her life\". Ranaut said, \"In this script my character is such that you get to express you emotions, emotions that you have never delivered before in front of the camera. So when I heard the script, it was something new and much more challenging, more interesting and exciting.\" Godse said that she accepted her role in the film because she identified with her character, Janet Sequira, whom she described as \"outgoing, vibrant, bold and outspoken\". Arjan Bajwa described his character, an aspiring fashion model, as uncompromising, achieving success in his own way. Samir Soni found his role as a closeted fashion designer very challenging, requiring research to flesh out the character and his personality. Soni's greatest challenge was to avoid a stereotypical homosexual character, instead subtly expressing his sexuality in his personality and relationships with the film's other characters. Rita Dhody and Narendra Kumar were chosen to style the film's characters. Dhody said it took nearly two months for UTV and Bhandarkar to persuade her to help design the film; she found the job challenging because she had to make everything as authentic as possible. Chopra had to wear 137 costumes in the film because her character passed through five phases. Initially, she was a \"hep\" character with brightly coloured, matching attire. Her make-up becomes lighter as she becomes a model and later a supermodel. When her career falters, Chopra's look becomes softer, demonstrating her character's lack of concern about her appearance before she returns to Mumbai. According to Dhody, Chopra's look is \"very contemporary and a very much today's look, but my idea was to streamline and take it to the classic side [rather] than making it trend-based\". Ranaut's character was designed to make audiences feel sympathy for her. Dhody gave her short dresses with low necklines, conveying the image of a supermodel comfortable with her body; during her low phase, she is shown in long T-shirts. Godse, whose character is a failed model, has a carefree look. Dhody said, \"Godse's look in the film is a fusion of rock and a grunge to give her the survivor look as a B-grade model, making her more chic and glamorous.\" She wears low-waisted trousers, chains and ankle boots. Details of jewellery, clothes, colour and accessories outline the characters; everything had to be sychronised and complement each other to create an authentic look. Dhody said, \"We didn't try to sensationalise it by making it more bling- or costume-based. I had to restrain myself from going overboard due to Bhandarkar's reservations\". The film's narrative included 11 character-based ramp shows. Principal photography commenced in December 2007, and the film was shot extensively in Mumbai. The scene with Ranaut's wardrobe malfunction during a ramp walk was filmed in late January 2008 at Mehboob Studios, Bandra. While filming the scene, only essential cast and crew members\u2014included Bhandarkar and his cinematographer\u2014were present; according to Bhandarkar, it was a sensitive scene and a sensitive issue. Chopra had to gain 6 kilograms (13\u00a0lb) as a girl from the Punjab, and then lose it as a model; she had five \"looks\" in the film, connoting the phases through which her character passes. Although the media spread rumours that Chopra was starving herself to reduce her weight to that of a supermodel, she said that her appearance was achieved with two months of training and a disciplined diet. The film's climactic scene in which Chopra walks the ramp at Paris Fashion Week was supposed to be filmed in Paris, with the Eiffel Tower as a backdrop, but Bhandarkar could not shoot there. Instead, the scene uses some footage from the actual fashion show. In mid-August 2008, key scenes with Chopra, Raj Babbar and Kiran Juneja\u2014Chopra's character's parents\u2014were filmed in Chandigarh for authenticity; Bhandarkar said, \"we wanted to bring the essence of the city alive in the scenes\". The director said the film took about 106 days to complete, compared with his 45-day average. Fashion is Bhandarkar's fourth women-centric film after Chandni Bar (2001), Page\u00a03 (2005) and Corporate (2006) to earn widespread praise for their strong, independent female characters. According to The Times of India, Fashion \"is not about cliches alone and manages to transcend them with its moving tale of three women who try to maintain their honour, dignity, [and] identity in a cruel world that spills over with grime behind the glamour. The film not only takes you behind the psychedelic ramp, it travels through the dark inner recesses of the three lead characters, laying bare their strengths and weaknesses; their fears and hopes; their dreams and nightmares\". Ananya Bhattacharya of Zee News said that the film \"went on to speak volumes about women, their aspirations and the dark side-effects of over-ambition\". In an interview with the Hindustan Times, Chopra said that the film is \"an emotional tale and the story of three girls\u00a0...\u00a0[which] shows female bonding in a beautiful way\u00a0...\u00a0\". Reviewer Kriti Verma of Headlines India said that the movie \"shows every bit about the life of models and bring the inside secrets of [the] fashion industry. It has everything\u2014fashion weeks, casting couch, drugs, abuses, gay designers, bitching.\" Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama wrote, \"the narrative is inevitably filled with lots of glam-n-glitz moments. The fashion shows, the stunning models, the superb styling, the vibrant colours and the behind the scenes drama is worth every penny spent on the ticket.\" A reviewer from Sify.com found the film's depiction of fashion industry \"superficial\"; noting that the film does not talk about the clothing, the creativity, or the passion for work in the fashion industry. However, according to Bhandarkar the film was \"not about [the] fashion industry as such. It only has fashion as a backdrop. The film is more about the story of models, designers and people. And it is on aspects like the personal story, the individual story, their ups and downs, their journey that I tried to capture.\" Critics also said that the film explores drug abuse, homosexuality and gay relationships. Designer Vineet Bahl complained about the male characters, most of whom are portrayed as \"gay designers and exploitative agency owners\". He said, \"Bhandarkar could have done without gross generalisations. It makes the movie shallow and over-dramatic\". The film alludes several times to actual incidents, including a scene where Bhandarkar appears at a fashion show to research his upcoming film on the fashion industry. One of the models looking at him says, \"Oh that's Madhur Bhandarkar, the realistic filmmaker. Now he is going to expose the fashion world.\" It is taken from the Bhandarkar's experiences while researching the subjects of his films. The Indian Express said that Chopra's character, who indulges in drug and alcohol abuse and undergoes rehabilitation, resembles the life of British-educated model Shivani Kapur, who had similar experiences. The scene in which Ranaut's character's top slips off during a ramp walk resembles the experience of Carol Gracias at the 2006 Lakme Fashion Week. The Fashion soundtrack album was composed by Salim-Sulaiman and the lyrics were written by Irfan Siddiqui. Sandeep Nath appeared as a guest lyricist for \"Fashion Ka Jalwa\". The soundtrack contains four original songs, one theme and five remixes. The music was released by Bhandarkar and the cast on 11 September 2008 at the Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai. The cast played the film's title song, offering their first CD to Ganesha. Fashion's soundtrack received favourable reviews from critics. The Hindustan Times rated the album 3.5 out of 5 and said, \"It's very hard to find anything wrong with the album. Salim-Suleiman have done a wonderful job as composers and have brought out the essence of the movie in a remarkable way. Irfan has come out with great lyrics and every singer has given his or her best shot\". Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama described the album as \"a winner all the way\", and said, \"Madhur Bhandarkar films haven't been known for their music, even though the albums of Corporate and Page 3 still saw some sales on the stands. However, Fashion is all set to break the jinx while turning out to be the first Madhur Bhandarkar film ever to boast of a truly mass as well as class appealing score\". Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com rated the album three out of five, and said that the film offers a well-designed mix of trendy tunes and refined melodies. The film's trailer was unveiled on 17 July 2008 in Mumbai and was received warmly by critics and audiences. Emphasizing its theme, the lead female cast walked the ramp at fashion shows to promote the film. Fashion was also promoted at the Lakme Fashion Week, where Chopra, Ranaut and Godse walked the ramp. Made on a budget of \u20b9180 million (US$2.8\u00a0million), Fashion earned \u20b985 million (US$1.3\u00a0million), and before release recouped half its cost from tie-ins with brands including Reebok, Lenovo, Sunsilk and LG Electronics. Products from these brands were showcased in the film and the brands promoted the film in their advertising. Bhandarkar expressed disappointment about the Censor Board for Film Certification's decision to grant the film an \"A\" certificate\u2014meant for viewers 18 years or older\u2014instead of the \"U/A\" certificate that he had expected. His previous films received U/A certification despite adult content. According to them, their new guidelines did not allow Fashion a U/A certification. The board was willing to issue a U/A certificate after several cuts; Bhandarkar refused and accepted the A certificate since the scenes in question were crucial to the narrative. Before its release, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) asked Bhandarkar to screen the film before its release due to its concern that Ranaut's character was based on Geetanjali Nagpal\u2014a former high-profile fashion model found begging, bedraggled and mentally unbalanced on the streets of Delhi in 2007. Nagpal was helped by the DCW, which did not want anyone profiting from her life. Bhandarkar narrated a summary of the film's plot at the DCW office, which satisfied the commission that there was no reference to Nagpal. A screening of the film was also held for the commission. The film was originally scheduled for release on 14 November 2008, but this clashed with the release of Chopra's film Dostana and Fashion was released 29 October (Diwali) on 700\u00a0screens worldwide. The film was released in a two-disc, NTSC DVD package on 22 December 2008 in all regions. Distributed by Moser Baer Home Videos, one disc contains the film; the other disc has additional content on the making of the film and interviews with the stars and director. VCD and Blu-Ray versions were released at the same time. The film's television premiere took place on UTV Movies on 15 March 2009. Fashion garnered generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its direction, screenplay, cinematography, music and performances. Kriti Verma of Headlines India rated the film 4 out of 5, describing it as \"an outstanding film and a must watch for people who visit a theatre for something more than entertainment\". Zee News gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5, called it \"a must watch\" and praised the sets, music, performances and storyline. Nikhat Kazmi rated the film 3.5 out of 5, describing it as \" a sensitive parable on bonding and empowerment\". Taran Adarsh rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praised the cinematography, screenplay, dialogue, costumes and styling, and called Fashion a \"hard-hitting film that enlightens you, moves you, motivates and deflates you, even shocks and surprises you and of course, entertains you\". Rajeev Masand gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5, and wrote, \"Fashion is an easy watch because the very subject lends itself to so much interest. Like the director\u2019s own film Page 3 it is mostly sensational and on several occasions compromises authenticity for the sake of exaggerated drama\". He praised the performances of the lead cast, writing that \"Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best. The truth is, it\u2019s one of those by-the-book characters that she understands only too well and performs just as easily. Ditto for Kangana Ranaut who plays the eccentric superdiva with such a practiced hand, it almost seems like an effortless delivery. It's\u00a0...\u00a0Godse who invests such sincerity into her role, that she makes the character a real flesh and blood person. Kitu Gidwani, as the agency head who mentors our protagonist, Kitu strikes all the right notes, never once slipping out of character.\" Subhash K. Jha of the Indo-Asian News Service rated the film 3 out of 5, calling it \"a truly outstanding film\". He said, \"Bhandarkar takes us through a labyrinth of emotions, some devastating in their gut-level directness. But at the end, we come away with a film that gives us something to hold on to permanently even as the characters on screen lose practically everything worth holding on to\". Jha also wrote that the sequences between Chopra and Ranaut as the highlights of the film. Gaurav Malani from The Economic Times rated the film a 3 out of 5, praised Chopra's performance and wrote, \"Chopra's character graph [is] skillfully sketched from an aspiring model to an ambitious showstopper to a brash supermodel and subsequently to a faded manikin, desperate to make her comeback. In each phase her character exudes [a] contrasting gamut of emotions\". Khalid Mohamed rated Fashion 3 out of 5, called the film a \"must-try\", and wrote, \"Excelling on the catwalk as well as in the moments of self-destruction, Ranaut\u2019s is the terrific, show-stopping performance\". Sonia Chopra of Sify criticised the film's superficial portrayal of the fashion industry and called the film a superficial take on the lives of models and a dumbed-down version of the workings of the fashion industry. However, she praised the performances. Fashion opened well at the box office, filling 90\u2013100 percent of seats in most Indian multiplexes. The film competed with the opening of a popular comedy, Golmaal Returns, but both films were box-office successes. Fashion earned approximately \u20b940.4 million (US$630,000) on its opening day, the highest for a Madhur Bhandarkar film to date. The film went on to gross \u20b9600 million (US$9.3\u00a0million) at the box office. Fashion is noted for being a commercial success despite being a women-centric film without a male lead. The National Film Archive of India (NFAI\u2014part of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting of the Government of India), which aims to safeguard the heritage of Indian cinema, preserved Fashion with others directed by Bhandarkar, including Chandni Bar (2001) and Page 3 (2005). In 2013, The Times of India included the film on its list of \"Top 10 path breaking women oriented films of Bollywood\". For International Women's Day 2013, Zee News included the film on its list of best women-centric films. Fashion received a number of awards and nominations in categories ranging from the film itself to its direction, screenplay, music and acting. At 56th National Film Awards, the film won two awards: Best Actress (Chopra) and Best Supporting Actress (Ranaut). The film received seven nominations at the 54th Filmfare Awards, including Best Director (Bhandarkar) and Best Screenplay and won the awards for Best Actress (Chopra) and Best Supporting Actress (Ranaut). It was nominated for six awards at the fourth Apsara Film & Television Producers Guild Awards, winning three: Best Actress (Chopra), Best Supporting Actress (Ranaut) and Best Female Debut (Godse).",

It is about the return after a hiatus of the ever-delightful Jaya Bachchan.\" Mimmy Jain of The Indian Express, in a positive review, wrote, \"Fiza is the kind of movie that every critic prays will never come his way.

        "full_text": " Gadar: Ek Prem Katha (Translation: Revolt: A Love Story) is a 2001 Indian period action drama film, starring Sunny Deol, Amisha Patel, and Amrish Puri, set in the time of the Partition of India in 1947. Gadar: Ek Prem Katha was a box office phenomenon and sold more tickets at theatres in India than any film in history apart from Sholay (1975). When Gadar was released on 15 June 2001, producer for Zee Telefilms, Nitin Keni, director Anil Sharma, lead star Sunny Deol, assorted trade pundits, and seasoned film critics had no idea that the film, which was set during a turbulent time in modern Indian history, would create box-office history. Gadar clashed with Aamir Khan's Lagaan at the box office. Made for \u20b9185 million (US$2.9\u00a0million), Gadar has made more than \u20b9600 million (US$9.3\u00a0million) and after its theatrical run, was commercially one of the most successful movies in India when it was released. It is in list of \"One of the Biggest Blockbusters in Hindi Cinema\". Gadar: Ek Prem Katha is the most watched Hindi film in India as it recorded 5.05 crore footfalls in India. The shy role of Sunny Deol was admired and led to the Filmfare nomination for the best actor. The story of this film is loosely based on the life of Boota Singh.   Set in 1947, during the Partition of India, the film tells the story of a truck driver, Tara Singh (Sunny Deol), a Sikh, who falls in love with a Muslim girl, Sakina (Amisha Patel), belonging to an aristocratic family. The story begins with Sikhs and Hindus being attacked by Muslims in Pakistan when trying to migrate to India by train from the railway station in west Punjab. In response, Sikhs and Hindus react by killing Muslims migrating to Pakistan from India. During the Hindu-Muslim riots that erupted soon after the Partition, Tara recognizes Sakina from the little Taj Mahal antique in her hands. He then saves and protects her from a murderous mob chasing her because she failed to get onto the train with her family members after being lost in the crowd. As the mob attempts to brutally rape and murder her, Tara Singh defends Sakina and disguises her as a Sikh to protect her. While driving back to Tara's house, the story has a major flashback showing the relationship between Tara and Sakina during her college days, but the real ambition of Tara is to become a singer. Some girls in college who are friends of Sakina, fool Tara into thinking that they have got him a spot on a music show in return for a favor. Tara performs badly in front of the musyed by Sakina (Amisha Patel). His friend then gives him tablets that help him prove his singing skills. Soon after it is shown that Sakina is not the real music teacher, which saddens him. When performing on the music show Sakina announces that she will not do her act, instead giving Tara a chance to sing despite being against the will of the seniors at the college. Tara impresses everybody with his talent. While returning home after completing the final year, Sakina is given a goodbye present by Tara. Later, Tara's parents and two sisters are seen weeping in Pakistan as they did not return to Amritsar before the partition. Tara's Muslim friend comes to meet the family and requests them to stay with him as parents love both friends equally. But Tara's parents and sisters do not agree, they reluctantly decide to leave. While leaving for the station, Tara's father and mother give their daughters two paper pouches. The bewildered twins ask them what that is. Father says that the sisters should not hesitate to give up their lives lest any Muslim attacks and shatters them and their dignity. Then the family reaches the station and boards the train. After some time, a large mob attacks the whole train. People run pell-mell to save themselves but they are killed gruesomely. Tara's sister hastily tries to eat the poison but two men throw it from their hands and kill them after a cruel physical abuse. Subsequently and back in the present, Sakina starts living in Tara's house and their respect culminates into love. One day, Tara's aunt comes to meet him and taking pity on the orphaned Sakina, asks her boy to transport her to the Muslim refugee camps. Tara and Sakina head out towards the camp but are again attacked by a violent mob. Tara again saves his Madamji. Slowly Sakina and Tara Singh fall in love, get married and become parents of a baby boy named Jeet. Their life seems like a bed of roses, until Sakina sees an old newspaper during Holi festival that has a photograph of her father, Ashraf Ali (Amrish Puri), whom she believes had been killed during the riots during the Partition. Her father is now the mayor of Lahore. When Sakina calls him from the Pakistani Embassy in Delhi, he arranges to fly her to Lahore. However, Tara and their son, who are supposed to accompany her to Lahore, are told at the last minute that their visa formalities have not been completed, which compels them to stay in India. Sakina leaves with a heavy heart. She meets her whole clan back in Lahore. Everyone is thrilled to see her. Later, when she wants to return to India, her mom tells her that she was about to be disowned as people were babbling about her staying with an Indian Jat. Her father too relates all of their hardships during the journey from India to Pakistan. Sakina is hurt and broken-hearted. But she starts protesting when her parents' friends start using her post marriage life as a publicity stunt and depict her in-laws badly in order to extract more sympathy and votes from the Pakistani population. Later she is introduced to a very handsome guy who hails from a very influential rich family. She is told that she would be marrying him. But Sakina refuses and even asks the Qazi Saheb to leave her alone, saying second marriage during the husband's lifetime is a sin. Her parents and Mamaji are very angry with that. They forcibly lock her up in a room inside the palace. Tara and his son, accompanied by a friend,enter Pakistan illegally at the border. Tara tries to take shelter in his old friend's house but hearing his wife fight about that, leaves the place with his son Jeet and his assistant. There they find out that Sakina is getting married and reach her before the marriage takes place. Mother and son reunite happily. A fight is about to break out when the priest stops them, as this can end up harming Sakina's father's career in politics. Ashraf Ali agrees for their marriage under two conditions: they should live in Pakistan and Tara should convert to Islam. But, after the second attack occurs, little Jeet is badly injured. These conditions are accepted by Tara in public the next day which was against Ashraf Ali's plans. He makes Tara insult his country to prove that he is a true Pakistani, which enrages him and this makes him kill a member of the mob that was hired by Ashraf to kill him. Tara, Sakina, their son, and a friend manage to escape. Tara and Sakina escape from the city and hide in a poor couple's cottage near the border forest. But the man's wife is a greedy woman who simply wants all of Sakina's ornaments for herself. She refuses to listen to her husband and tries to throw Sakina out from the house when she does not get more jewellery from her. But after Sakina leaves with Jeet and Tara, Ashraf Ali reaches the cottage and relocates his daughter. After a long period of turmoil they catch a cotton mill train bound for India. Ashraf Ali finds out, and he takes some men to stop them. In the ensuing fight Sakina gets shot by her own father. In the hospital Sakina has lapsed into a coma.

It stars Aamir Khan, Asin and Jiah Khan in lead roles while Tinnu Anand, Pradeep Rawat and Riyaz Khan essay supporting roles. The film's main plot was adapted from Christopher Nolan's Memento. and the comedy plot was inspired by the 1951 British movie Happy Go Lovely. The film explores the life of a rich businessman who develops anterograde amnesia following a violent encounter in which his love interest, a model named Kalpana, was killed. He tries to avenge the killing with the aid of photographs from a Polaroid Instant camera and permanent tattoos on his body. Aamir Khan's character was featured in a 3D video game titled Ghajini \u2013 The Game, which is based on the movie. On release it became the highest-grossing movie of all time until it was beaten by another movie, 3 Idiots (also starring Khan) the following year. Ghajini's paid preview collections were \u20b927 million (US$420,000)..   Sunita (Jiah Khan) is a medical student, working on a project about the human brain with her classmates. When she was denied access by her professor to the curious case of Sanjay Singhania (Aamir Khan), a man reported to have anterograde amnesia, because it is under criminal investigation, Sunita decides to investigate the matter herself. It is later revealed that Sanjay loses his memory every 15 minutes. He uses a system of photographs, notes, and tattoos on his body to recover his memory after each cycle to remind himself of his mission: to avenge the death of his wife Kalpana (Asin). He systematically kills the people who were involved to the murder. His main target is Ghajini Dharmatma (Pradeep Rawat), a notable social personality in the city, and the man directly responsible for Kalpana's death and Sanjay's condition. Police inspector Arjun Yadav (Riyaz Khan) tracks Sanjay down to his apartment and knocks him unconscious. Yadav finds two diaries in which Sanjay has chronicled the events of 2005 and 2006. The film flashes back to 2005 as Yadav reads the diary. Sanjay Singhania is the chairman of the Air Voice mobile telephone company. In the course of business, he sends his men to meet Kalpana, a struggling model of Mumbai, about putting up a billboard above her apartment. The owner of Kalpana's advertising firm misinterprets this as a romantic advance and, in view of a possible lucrative Air Voice ad campaign, encourages Kalpana to accept the overture. Kalpana thinks of it as an innocent prank that may fetch her better modelling work and decides to act as Sanjay's girlfriend. Sanjay goes to confront Kalpana about this but falls in love with her at first sight. He hides his identity and introduces himself as Sachin, and the two begin spending time together. The diary ends with Sanjay proposing to Kalpana and promising himself that he will reveal his actual identity if she accepts. When Yadav is about to read the 2006 diary, Sanjay awakes and attacks him, tying him up. Ghajini realizes that someone is trying to kill him but is unable to figure out who. Sunita visits Sanjay's flat and discovers Sanjay's plan to kill Ghajini. She takes both his diaries before finding Yadav, beaten and bound, and freeing him. Just then, Sanjay arrives, he remembers neither of them and chases them out. Yadav is hit by a bus as he flees in terror, and Sunita, believing Ghajini is the good guy in danger, informs him about Sanjay. Ghajini arrives at Sanjay's flat and destroys all of Sanjay's photographs and notes, as well as the tattoos on Sanjay's body, so that Sanjay is left with nothing to help him recover his memory. Meanwhile, Sanjay discovers that Sunita had warned Ghajini and he goes to her dormitory to kill her, but Sunita calls the police and Sanjay is arrested. Back in her dormitory as Sunita reads the diaries, the film flashes back to 2006, where it is revealed that Kalpana had accepted Sanjay's proposal. When this diary ends abruptly, Sunita investigates further and discovers that Kalpana was travelling to Goa for a modelling assignment when she came upon 25 innocent young girls being trafficked. She had saved the girls with the help of some army soldiers on board, who named Ghajini as the ringleader of the racket. Outraged, Ghajini broke into Kalpana's apartment with his goons to kill her. When Sanjay arrived, he found Kalpana stabbed. Ghajini then hit Sanjay over the head with an iron rod. Sanjay's last sight was Ghajini brutally murdering Kalpana with the iron rod. Kalpana's last word to Sanjay was \"Ghajini.\" Sunita, now aware of the shocking truth, finds Sanjay in the hospital and tells him the truth. He flies into a heartbroken rage and tracks down Ghajini with Sunita's help. He fights off all of Ghajini's henchmen with a superior and anger-fueled strength. Ghajini,upon realizing Sanjay is too strong for him, flees. Sanjay's memory loss strikes again, and he forgets who Ghajini is. Ghajini takes this opportunity to stab Sanjay and taunt him with the grisly tale of how he murdered Kalpana. As he is about to make Sanjay relive the experience by killing Sunita in the same exact way, Sanjay recovers the memory of Kalpana's murder, and overpowers Ghajini in a flash of strength. He finally kills Ghajini, in the same way Ghajini had killed Kalpana. The film ends with a still-amnesiac Sanjay volunteering at an orphanage named after Kalpana. Sunita gives him a gift that reminds him of his bond with Kalpana, and Sanjay imagines Kalpana by his side, finally at peace with himself forever.

It is, as we used to say in the old days, paisa vasool.

The film received some mixed and negative reviews. Gaurav Malani of Indiatimes gave 2 stars, criticising its length while praising the performance of the cast.

It was declared an All Time Blockbuster. Some other independent sources have stated that Ghajini has grossed \u20b9200 crore (equivalent to \u20b9390\u00a0crore or US$60\u00a0million in 2016) in two weeks\u2014totting up a domestic gross of \u20b9160 crore (equivalent to \u20b9312\u00a0crore or US$48\u00a0million in 2016) and an overseas collection of \u20b940 crore (equivalent to \u20b978\u00a0crore or US$12\u00a0million in 2016).

The original Tamil version of Ghajini was inspired by the American film Memento, which itself was adapted from the short story Memento Mori. The film stars Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby, a former insurance fraud investigator searching for the man he believes raped and killed his wife during a burglary. Leonard suffers from anterograde amnesia, which he contracted from severe head trauma during the attack on his wife. Certain concepts like writing notes behind instant Polaroid photographs and tattooing facts on his body were inspired by the film. According to Aamir Khan, \"Ghajini is not a remake or even slightly inspired by Memento, but it's a remake of the Tamil film, Ghajini\". Several comical scenes in the film are similar to Happy Go Lovely (1951). The scene where Kalpana (Asin Thottumkal) helps a blind man to cross the road is similar to the French film Am\u00e9lie. It was notable that Christopher Nolan was aware that an Indian film with a same kind of story similar to Memento was released though in a different story plot. As said by Anil Kapoor in an interview, when he met Nolan, he said Nolan was \"upset\" about the Hindi film and Nolan amusingly said that he was neither \"credited\" nor \"compensated.\" The film has six songs including two remixes composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics by Prasoon Joshi. Bollywood Hungama wrote, \"The music of Ghajini is all set to make waves way into 2009 after the Christmas release of the film. When 'best of the best' list would be compiled at the year end, it would be hard to ignore Ghajini.\" Rediff.com gave it the highest possible rating of five stars with the reviewer praising Rahman saying, \"This could just be one of his finest albums ever. Not just are the tracks great, but each one segues into the next with perfect unpredictability.\"",

The opening scene features a female lawyer Fatima Madam (Mita Vashisht) defending Siddhu in court against accusations of small-time theft. The lawyer tries to convince the judge to show leniency towards Siddhu on account of his disadvantaged background as an orphan. The judge points out that Siddhu has already been shown leniency four times, and is greeted with laughter by everybody, including Siddhu. In the commotion, Siddhu steals Rs. 400 from his own lawyer's purse. Siddhu is let free. Later, when he asks the lawyer what her fees are, she asks him for a fees of Rs. 400, and he is thus forced to part with the money he has just stolen. The lawyer gives no indication of awareness that Siddhu had stolen an equal amount of money. Later, Siddhu, while joking around with friends, gets angry when one of his friends suggests that the lawyer may be receiving sexual favours from Siddhu in exchange for defending him in court. A few days later, Raunak Singh hires Siddhu to deliver a letter to a local cricket player, and to beat up the player if he shows signs of resisting. Unknown to Siddhu, the letter contains instructions to the player to get out after scoring a certain number of runs, so that Ronnie can win a bet. Siddhu delivers the letter and intimidates the cricket player into agreeing to follow the instructions, breaking the player's bat in the process. Later, while returning, he gets into a motorcycle speed race with a motorcycle gang led by Charlie (Deepak Tijori), which escalates into a dare game to run towards a moving train at night. Siddhu beats Charlie's past record in the game. Charlie chooses to run again, but falls on the train tracks, and seems to be headed for death as the train approaches him. Siddhu rescues Charlie at considerable personal risk. In the process, Siddhu becomes friends with Alisha (Rani Mukerji), also part of the gang, and their friendship blossoms into love. The famous song Aati Kya Khandala is situated during this period, when Siddhu is trying to cheer Alisha up after a fight with her father. It is revealed that Siddhu saw his own father's death when he was a child which mentally affected him throughout his life. His father's words \u2013 \"anybody can swim with the tide, but the truly brave person is he who swims against the tide\"\u2014remained with him, though he had only been with his father for a little while. Back in his local community, Siddhu witnesses an incident of some of Ronnie's men beating up a local restaurateur for not paying extortion money to Ronnie's gang. The restaurateur runs for his life as Ronnie's men chase him, but none of the other community people come to his aid. Harihar Mafatlal (Akshay Anand), a social worker, coaxes a police constable to stop the fight. The restaurateur and his two assailants land up on the roof where Siddhu is doing boxing practice, with Hari and the constable following. The constable breaks up the fight and scolds the restaurateur, and Hari is angry at the constable for blaming the victim. The assailants leave, greeting Siddhu on the way out. Siddhu offers some water to the restaurateur and introduces himself to Hari, suggesting to both to avoid getting on the wrong side of Ronnie. Hari speaks of principle and self-respect, and Siddhu is reminded of things that his father told him long ago. Ronnie is furious to hear about this, and wishes to kill the restaurateur and Hari immediately. Ronnie explains the logic of terror to his henchmen: if even a few people stop acceding to his demands, then that will instill rebelliousness against Ronnie's demands in others. Fear is essential for the kind of respect Ronnie enjoys, and being lenient against a few people who stand up to him based on a short-term cost\u2013benefit analysis will have long-term negative consequences for Ronnie. Jai, however, dissuades Ronnie from taking rash action. In the process, it is revealed that Jai and Ronnie are in the process of bribing politicians and government officials to make Ronnie the owner of a large construction project. Hari later canvasses some villagers together, trying to get one of them to sign a complaint against Ronnie that can be filed with the police so that official action can be taken against him. Siddhu attends the meeting at Jai's request, but does not inform Jai or Ronnie about it immediately. Instead, Siddhu offers Hari a friendly warning to cease and desist these activities. During the conversation that ensues, Siddhu says that his own motto in life is simple: live and let live. Hari reveals the principle guiding his own actions: whenever he sees himself in the mirror, he should not feel ashamed of what he sees. Ronnie nonetheless comes to know of the events during the meeting, and is angry. He tells Siddhu to arrange a meeting between Hari and himself (Ronnie) so that Ronnie can dissuade Hari from these activities. Siddhu agrees, and calls Hari over to a bridge, on the pretext that he himself (Siddhu) needs to talk to Hari. Hari arrives at the bridge, expecting to meet Siddhu. Ronnie arrives along with his men, beats up Hari, and throws him from the bridge after which he is crushed under a moving train. Siddhu is furious at Jai and Ronnie, and attacks Ronnie physically, but Ronnie's men control him, and he is allowed to go on account of the fact that he is Jai's brother and he was the one who managed to inadvertently help Ronnie kill Hari. Siddhu, returning home, cannot bear the sight of himself in the mirror, and breaks it. It is also revealed that Hari was the brother of Alisha (Siddhu's romantic interest), something Siddhu had been unaware of because he was living separately. Siddhu confesses everything to Fatima Madam, the female lawyer who had defended him in the beginning of the movie, but refuses to testify against Ronnie in court, for fear of implicating his elder brother Jai. The lawyer tries to talk him into testifying, but fails. She challenges him to reveal the truth to Alisha, which he does, and they break up. In a subsequent boxing match (against boxing champion \"Kala Tiger\"), that Siddhu has been preparing for several months, Siddhu is told by his brother, in the midst of the game, to throw away the match, since Ronnie has bet money on Siddhu losing. Siddhu throws away the game, allowing the other boxer to beat him unconscious. He is furious at his brother, and they have an oral confrontation. In the process, Siddhu is forced to confront that his father had betrayed five of his friends in the Indian independence movement to the British out of fear of being tortured, causing all of them to be killed. Siddhu realises that his father was a good man, but, like everybody else, was a coward and lacked the strength to fight injustice. Yet, he knows that his father wanted to instill these values in him, and he vows to bring Hari's killers to justice and complete the task that Hari attempted to begin. He tells Fatime Madam (the lawyer) that he is willing to testify publicly against Ronnie as well as against his own brother Jai, and also confesses to her his theft of Rs. 400 (shown at the beginning of the movie). She expresses pride in Siddhu, revealing that she knew all along about the theft and also knew that Siddhu would reveal it to her some day of his own accord. She tries to get Alisha to forgive Siddhu, but fails. Siddhu, now a reformed man, meets up with the cricketer he had beaten up a while back, presents him with a new cricket bat, and seeks forgiveness. When Ronnie discovers that Siddhu is the person who has filed a complaint against him, he is ready to kill Siddhu. Jai dissuades Ronnie, reassuring him that Jai himself will dissuade Siddhu from testifying publicly against Ronnie. In an emotional scene, Siddhu, when approached by Jai, confronts Jai instead, accusing Jai of neglecting his duties as an elder brother by encouraging Siddhu to follow himself in a life of crime. Jai realises his error and apologises. Upon returning home, Siddhu discovers Alisha waiting for him, and they embrace and reconcile. Later that night, Ronnie kills Jai and his men also try to kill Siddhu, but the motorcycle gang led by Charlie (whose life Siddhu had saved earlier) intervenes to save Siddhu's life. Siddhu wants to kill Ronnie in person to avenge his brother's death, but the female lawyer arrives in time to dissuade him. The next day, in court, Siddhu gives his testimony regarding Ronnie's murder of Hari. The court is adjourned until Monday. Coming out of court, Ronnie orders for a local bandh and forces all the shops to close down. He also has Siddhu's home broken into and his belongings thrown on the street. Siddhu, upon seeing this, walks up to Ronnie's house and challenges him to come out and duel alone, rather than hiding behind henchmen. Ronnie agrees, and all the people in the area come out to watch. The two boxers have a long and bloody boxing match, with nobody interfering. As the local people see one man with the courage to fight Raunak Singh, they awaken to the possibility that they too can resist his extortionary demands. Ronnie loses the fight, but he then orders his henchmen to kill Siddhu. The local people, who are much more numerous than Ronnie's henchmen, block the attempt. Together, they beat up Ronnie and his henchmen and force them to flee the area. The music were composed by Jatin-Lalit. Lyrics handled by Indeevar, Nitin Raikwar, Sameer, Vinod Mahendra. The film was declared a hit by Box Office India and its total gross was 200\u00a0million. A sequence in the film shows Aamir running on a rail track towards an oncoming train, which misses him by a few feet as he jumps off the tracks. 1.3 seconds was the only difference between Aamir and the train. This stunt was actually performed by Aamir himself. It won the Best Scene Award at the 44th Filmfare Awards, but Aamir later criticised himself for taking such an unnecessary risk. Rani Mukerji's voice was dubbed by Mona Shetty, who had a much more high-pitched voice. When asked if the director's decision to not use her voice in the film affected her, she said that her voice was dubbed as it \"did not suit the character\". It was remade in Tamil as Sudhandhiram (2000).",

        "full_text": " Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela (English: A Play of Bullets Ram-Leela), or simply Ram-Leela, is a 2013 Indian crime drama film co written, co edited, co produced, composed and directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. The film is an adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, set in violent times. The eponymous lead roles are played by Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone, and the supporting roles are played by an ensemble cast including Supriya Pathak Kapur, Richa Chadda, Sharad Kelkar, Gulshan Devaiah, Barkha Bisht Sengupta, and Abhimanyu SinghThe film also features a special appearance by Priyanka Chopra in the song \"Ram Chahe Leela\". The film's release, scheduled on 15 November 2013, had been stayed by Delhi High Court. The film was initially titled Ram-Leela but was changed to Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela in response to an order by the Delhi High Court and released as scheduled. The movie which premiered on the scheduled date, opened to critical acclaim and strong box-office collections worldwide. It ultimately earned \u20b92.02 billion (US$31\u00a0million). The film became the fifth highest-grossing film of 2013 and won three Filmfare Awards with Padukone winning her first Filmfare Award for Best actress, from a total of eight nominations.   During the festival of Holi, Ram boldly enters the house of the Sanera heads and flirts with Leela (Deepika Padukone), while her mother, Dhankor Baa (Supriya Pathak Kapur), the chieftain of the Saneras, is busy arranging a match for her daughter with a simple-minded NRI. Leela's elder brother Kanji (Sharad Kelkar) is angered by Ram's entry in the house and bribes the local police to raid Ram's house. Ram, however, manages to convince the policemen to leave in exchange for a set of his blue films. Ram and Leela develop a romance and plan to elope but a grim turn of events follows when Kanji accidentally kills Meghji and is in turn killed by Ram. To escape the suffering, Ram and Leela elope and marry but just as they are about to consummate their marriage, Ram's friends trace them and betray him by inebriating him and informing Leela's family of their location. The next morning, Leela is forcibly taken back home by Bhavani, her cousin, while Ram is hailed as a hero by the Rajadis for soiling Leela's reputation. He is rewarded by being made the new chieftain of the Rajadis. Meanwhile, Dhankor Baa (Supriya Pathak) arranges the engagement of Leela and the NRI, much to the chagrin of the pair. Leela refuses, citing that her finger is already occupied by the ring from her marriage to Ram. In her anger, Dhankor Baa chops off Leela's finger and upon learning of this, Ram does the same to his own finger and visits Leela while she is asleep. Leela still retains faith in Ram and sends Rasila (Richa Chadda), the widow of Kanji, to give Ram an ultimatum to take her away. Rasila is assaulted by Ram's friends and when Dhankor Baa learns of this, she sends Bhavani and other men to assault Kesar (Barkha Bisht Sengupta), Meghji's widow, who manages to evade them. In response to the attempt on Kesar, Ram storms into Leela's house and incapacitates the guards single-handedly. He then requests Dhankor Baa to consider negotiation for peace, and she invites him to celebrate Navratri with the Saneras, with the intention of having him killed. However, at the event, Bhavani secretly shoots and seriously injures Dhankor Baa to place the blame on the Rajadi. Leela is made the chieftain of the Saneras and gets busy tending to her mother. She bitterly carries out a negotiation with Ram, equally dividing the travel routes and trades, with the condition that the Saneras and Rajadis will not interact with each other ever again. Bhavani does not tolerate this development and deceives Leela into blindly signing a document that orders unrestrained killings of the Rajadis. During Dusshera, as the Ramlila parade is ending, many of the Rajadis are killed and the village is on the brink of war, which Ram senses. Ram and Leela decide that they are each other's and murder each other wholeheartedly by shooting one another and falling into a body of water, all the while oblivious to the fact that Dhankor Baa has undergone a change of heart and has killed Bhavani, ordering peace be meted out to the other clan. The two clans come together to cremate the bodies of the lovers. The budget of the film has been estimated to be between \u20b9350 million (US$5.4\u00a0million) and \u20b9850 million (US$13\u00a0million). Ranveer Singh was signed on for the role of Ram. Bhansali then cast Kareena Kapoor for the role of Leela. However, she walked out of the film and instead did Dharma Productions' romantic comedy Gori Tere Pyaar Mein. There later Bhansali approached Priyanka Chopra for the role of Leela but things did not materialised. However, Ranveer Singh confirmed in August 2012 that Deepika Padukone was finally signed on for the film. Singh, who plays a Gujarati boy, had to learn some Gujarati abuses as well as gain muscle for his character in the film. The first look of the film shows Padukone sporting a 30\u00a0kg ghaghra with a 50\u00a0metre 'ghera'. Richa Chadda was also signed on to play a significant role, cast by Shruti Mahajan whereas Barkha Bisht plays a supporting role opposite Abhimanyu Singh. Designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, who previously worked with Bhansali on Black, was hired initially for the costumes of the leading lady, but was later replaced by Anju Modi. Maxima Basu is the costume designer for Ranveer Singh and rest of the principal cast. There were rumours that Madhuri Dixit (Bhansali's heroine from Devdas), would be performing an item number for the film. Other actresses were also speculated to be signed for the song including Aishwarya Rai Bachchan (Bhansali's heroine from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Devdas, and Guzaarish) and Priyanka Chopra. Chopra was eventually confirmed to be performing the song. Initially shot in Gujarat, some sequences of Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela were shot in Udaipur particularly at Udaipur palace and Gangaur Ghat where a song sequence was shot. The story of the film is set in Gujarat. In Udaipur, Singh shot a song sequence in freezing cold water for about 45\u00a0minutes. Padukone was injured on set; however she had to continue shooting as an expensive set was put up at Film City for the song \"Nagada Sang Dhol.\" Sanjay Leela Bhansali had set up a gym on the sets in Filmcity Mumbai for the lead actor Ranveer Singh to not be late for the shooting and to avoid any delays for the movie. Some religious groups opposed the movie claiming that the former title Ramleela was misleading because the movie had nothing to do with Ramlila, traditional enactment of the life and story of Hindu deity, Lord Rama. A local court in Mumbai has issued an \"ex-parte ad-interim stay\" over the use of term Ramleela in the movie title. A Delhi court, on 12 November, stayed the release of the movie as per suit filed by six petitioners, including Prabhu Samaj Dharmik Ram Leela Committee, saying the movie hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus. Later the film's title was changed to Goliyon ki Rasleela Ram-Leela. On 21 November 2013, Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court banned the movie in Uttar Pradesh.  Kshatriya community opposed usage of community names in the movie, so Jadeja and Rabari community titles were changed to Saneda and Rajadi. This is the second time Sanjay Leela Bansali composed for a film, the first being the 2010 film Guzaarish. Monty Sharma who composed for Saawariya (2007) returns after long gap rendering the Background Music to the movie. The lyrics are penned by Siddharth\u2013Garima. Mor Bani Thanghat Kare is a 1944 Gujarati song translated by Jhaverchand Meghani and composed by Hemu Gadhvi. The soundtrack album was released on 2 October 2013 after a delay due to Ranveer Singh's health issues. Mohar Basu of Koimoi gave the album four out of five stars stating, \"Bhansali's artistic finickiness is something that shows even in his music. He is neat with his tunes and creates soulful sounds with visible conviction. Perhaps the songs won't hit you well in the first shot, but with the lapse of a few loops, it will be hard to take off the songs from your playlist. The album is one of the best of this year and it resounds with near perfect mystical rendition. I am going with a 4/5 and recommending that you don't miss this little masterpiece of an album!\" Daily News and Analysis also gave the album four out of five and wrote, \"Packed with 10 culturally nourished songs, the Ram-Leela soundtrack has no remix or reprised version, but it's a feast for music lovers. Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, known for making many a magum-opus, adds grandeur to the album with his compositions but at the same time gives enough space to the singers to shine.\" Yashika Mathur of Business Standard stated, \"The strong point of the \"Ram-Leela\" album is the soft romantic songs. Bhansali has put his best 'musical' foot forward. It deserves to be heard and enjoyed.\" Joginder Tuteja of Rediff.com stated, \"With just about everything working for the music of Ram Leela, what with classical, folk, fusion as well as contemporary sound finding their place under the sun, Bhansali makes sure that the soundtrack stands out from the clutter of some below average music of some notable biggies that have been making the rounds.\" The film released on 14 November 2013.The film got widest release 2000+ screens in domestic market and 550 screens in overseas and worldwide with around 2550 screens The film received generally positive reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the movie 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"On the whole, Goliyon Ki Raasleela ought to be watched for multiple reasons: the electrifying chemistry between its lead actors, the strong dramatic content, the scintillating musical score, the violent streak in the narrative and of course, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's execution of the material.\" Meena Iyer of The Times of India gave the movie 4 out of 5 stars, saying \"For the most part, Ram-Leela, SLB's most commercial work till date, has nice doses of raunch and ras (juice). Since the plot is Shakespearan, the maker has the arduous task of telling you this story on an opulent scale. Vintage palaces and daunting deserts are fitted in with precision. Deepika is breathtaking and in top form. Ranveer displays his six packs and histrionics with fair ease. You have to also applaud Richa Chadda and Supriya Pathak Kapur for being the talent they are.\" Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars and writes: \"If Sanjay Leela Bhansali is to be believed, Gujaratis are the most colorful, passionate, violent, loud and lusty community in this country\". She appreciates the director's aesthetic but also writes that \"By the end, I was so exhausted that I just wanted all the Rajadis and Saneras to kill each other so that we could be done with it\". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars. Appreciating the chemistry between the lead pair, he writes \"Deepika and Ranveer scorch up the screen in their romantic scenes, their intense passion a bold change from Bollywood's mostly tame embraces.\" Masand concludes the review by stating \"He (Bhansali) brings great style and aesthetic to an unapologetically commercial film, which I'm happy to say is far more engaging than the lazy blockbusters we've seen lately.\" Sarita Tanwar of DNA gave the movie 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Ram Leela is a lovely mixture of the familiar and the fresh. The technical aspects of the film are extraordinary: breath-taking sets, spellbinding cinematography, perfect music and a wonderful supporting cast. Deepika is perfect in every scene. Ranveer has surrendered to the director's vision and delivers a power-packed performance. Mihir Fadnavis of Firstpost writes \"Ram Leela has the soul of a cynical old noir peppered with a few small glimmers of masala. The direction, outstanding production design, gorgeous cinematography are supported by a surprisingly strong cast, and Padukone is a wild-eyed anchor in a sea of formula. Three years ago you'd never have expected her to improve so drastically and command the kind of energy she does now. Ranveer, on the other hand, is a weak link. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the movie 2.5 out of 5 stars, concluding \"'Ram-Leela' creates a couple that ignites the screen, and most of the time when these two are on screen, you keep watching. It's when the guns come on, and the gun-masters start roaring and shouting, that the love-story drowns, and everything gets both too noisy and too choreographed.\" Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the movie 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Ram-Leela is a lavish visual spread and is filled with moments of thrill, ingenuity and splendour but falters somewhere due to Sanjay Leela Bhansali's confused priorities and half-hearted romanticism.\" She praised Padukone's performance by stating \"Still, it's ever so watchable for Deepika Padukone. If ever there was any room for doubt, Deepika cancels it with her recently acquired aura. She embodies the lack of reason, the all-consuming 'junoon,' the bitterness, the sauciness, the arrogance that constitutes Leela so effectively, the film could well be titled after her. Only her.\" Raja Sen, in a more unfavourable review at Rediff.com, rated the movie at 1 out of 5 stars. While lamenting the recent slew of Shakespearean travesties in Bollywood, he states that Ram-Leela is \"silly, wasteful, loud\" in addition to being \"an overplotted, bloody mess\". He is critical of Bhansali's attempt at depicting the violent world of Ranjaar with dialogues which are \"very poor indeed, awful rhymes alternated with soap-operatic exposition\". Commenting on the cast, he says that Ranveer Singh \"plays Ram, and he does so head and shoulders more effeminately than you\u2019ve seen any Hindi film hero\" and \"speaks like a character written for Satish Kaushik in a David Dhawan movie, all poor puns and weird vocal tics and very lame dialogue\". Padukone, he observes, \"looks absolutely luminous but can\u2019t quite handle the sheer, relentless raunch the part demands\", while, \"Performers like Supriya Pathak and Gulshan Devaiah are reduced to cardboard caricatures and hamming, and the ever-effective Richa Chaddha isn\u2019t given elbow room.\" Mohammad Kamran Jawaid of Dawn gave the film 3/5 stars, writing that \"there is sumptuousness in Mr. Bhansali's frames, as he makes \"Ram-Leela\" a deliberate cross-breed between \u201cHum Dil De Chukay Sanam\u201d and \u201cDevdas\u201d. If the cinematic maven would have stuck to the former, the film's attraction wouldn't only have to rely on superficial physical lure, and later, the tendency to go bloody boom. It would have simply been an instant classic\". Danny Bowes, a New York-based critic, journalist and blogger whose reviews are published on Rogerebert.com, gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating \"What makes the ride as enjoyable as it is, and what truly give focus to Bhansali's lush, colorful compositions, are the performances of Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone in the leads. Singh prevails over a very odd (even by masala hero standards) mustache to give a deeply affecting and rich performance as Ram, but it's Padukone, as is increasingly the case, who steals the show with pure, deliberate, ferocious star power. The striking thing about her performance as Leela is how tightly coiled and tense it seems; she's ready at a moment's notice to kiss or kill (or both), never passive, never merely a photographic subject.\" According to Box Office India, Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela had a strong first day with collections of over \u20b9155 million (US$2.4\u00a0million) despite limited release due to controversies.

        "full_text": " Gol Maal (Chaos) is a 1979 Bollywood comedy movie directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee. It was produced by Mukherjee and N.C.Sippy with music by Rahul Dev Burman. The music was crafted by Burman to match the timbre of Mukherjee's perception of a subtle, complex love story involving the Indian middle class. The film generated several awards and was praised by critics.   Ramprasad Dashrathprasad Sharma (Amol Palekar), a qualified CA, is looking for a job. He and his sister Ratna (Manju Singh) have no relatives or acquaintances except Dr. Kedar (David). Dr. Kedar tells him about Bhavani Shankar's (Utpal Dutt) firm known as Urmila Traders. Shankar is a man of traditional values: He hates youth wearing modern clothes. He is a sports fan but thinks lowly of youth knowing anything about sports. But his weirdest trait is hatred towards men without moustaches. He thinks they are characterless. Ramprasad has a moustache. He takes care of other problems by wearing kurta and feigning ignorance about sports. Bhavani hires him immediately. Ram is a hardworking guy, so Bhavani (and Ram) have no problems. However, one day Ram takes leave by pretending that his mother (who died many years ago) has taken ill and goes to watch a hockey match. Bhavani Shankar, who attendes the match, sees him there. The next day Bhavani summons Ramprasad to his office and asks him about the hockey match. Remembering the plot of a movie a friend of his is shooting, Ram convinces Bhavani Shankar that he had seen his \"moustache-less\" identical twin Lucky (alias Lakshmanprasad Dashrathprasad Sharma) at the stadium. Bhavani Shankar buys his argument and feels bad about accusing him. He makes amends by hiring Lucky to teach his daughter Urmila (Bindiya Goswami) music. Ramprasad reluctantly shaves his moustache to become Lucky and starts to teach Urmila. He is helped by his actor friend Deven Verma (playing himself). Urmila (aka Urmi) is the exact opposite of her father. She takes immediate liking to Lucky, while Ram is barely noticed by her. Bhavani notices this and gives Ram another job to tutor on the pretext of her exams. Meanwhile, Mrs. Srivastav (Dina Pathak), a socialite, is roped to play the part of Ram, \"Lakshman\" and Ratna's mother. Like Ram, she also ends up playing her own twin in front of Bhavani. Ram tells Urmila the truth. Urmila tells him to tell the truth to Bhavani as well. Ram goes to Bhavani to tell the truth, but Bhavani sees Ram's moustache giving away. Bhavani exposes Ram but ends up thinking that Lucky murdered Ram and impersonated him to marry Urmila. In a hilarious chase that follows, Bhavani ends up totaling a police jeep. The senior inspector (Om Prakash) mistakes him for a thug named Pascal D'Costa and is about to lock him up in the jail. Only when his inspector identifies Bhavani Shankar by his real identity is he freed. By now, a harried Bhavani has developed hatred for twins as well. On coming home, he finds that Urmila and Lucky are married. He refuses to give them blessings, until Dr. Kedar comes to the scene and explains the situation. Bhavani becomes even more furious but, on everybody's insistence, relents. The film ends with a family photo of Mrs. Srivastav, Ratna, Urmila, Ram, Dr. Kedar, Bhavani's sister Kalindi (Shubha Khote) and Bhavani (who is shown without a moustache). Hrishikesh Mukherjee had first selected Rekha to enact the heroine's part but felt that he would be wasting a talented actress in film where the hero was the mainstay.

The film is based on the novel The Guide, by R. K. Narayan. The film was a box office hit upon release. The movie proved memorable for its award-winning performances by the lead actors and memorable music by S. D. Burman. Time magazine listed it at Number Four on its list of Best Bollywood Classics. A 120-minute U.S. version was written by Pearl S. Buck, and directed and produced by Tad Danielewski. The film was screened at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, 42 years after its release.   The movie starts with Raju (Dev Anand) being released from jail. Raju was a freelance guide, who earned his living by taking tourists to historic sites. One day, a wealthy and aging archaeologist, Marco (Kishore Sahu) comes to the city with his young wife Rosie (Waheeda Rehman), the daughter of a courtesan. Marco wants to do some research on the caves outside the city and hires Raju as his guide. While Marco devotes himself to the discovery of the cave, Raju takes Rosie on a tour and appreciates her dancing ability and innocence. He learns about Rosie's background as a daughter of a prostitute and how Rosie has achieved respectability as the wife of Marco but at a terrible cost. She had to give up her passion of dancing since it was unacceptable to Marco. Meanwhile, Rosie tries to commit suicide by consuming poison. Marco, upon learning of the incident, returns from the caves to see Rosie and is furious with Rosie after seeing her alive. He tells her that her act of committing suicide was a drama, otherwise she would have consumed more sleeping pills so that she could really have died. Upon returning to the caves which were discovered, Rosie learns that Marco is spending time and enjoying the company of a native tribal girl. She is enraged at Marco and both indulge in a serious heated discussion, which concludes with Rosie leaving the caves, and she once again wants to end her life. Raju calms her down by saying that committing suicide is a sin, and that she should live to pursue her dream. She finally says good-bye to the relation of being the wife of Marco. Now she needs support and a home. Raju gives her shelter. Rosie is considered a prostitute by Raju's community (as classical dancing traditionally was prostitutes' work at royal courts), which leads to many problems, including his mother and her brother insisting that Rosie be kicked out. Raju refuses and his mother leaves him. His friend and driver also falls out with him over Rosie. Raju loses his business and the entire town turns against him. Undeterred by these setbacks, Raju helps Rosie embark on a singing and dancing career and Rosie becomes a star. As she rises as a star, Raju becomes dissolute \u2014 gambling and drinking. Marco comes back on the scene. Trying to win Rosie back, he brings flowers and has his agent ask Rosie to release some jewelry which is in a safe deposit box. Raju, a bit jealous, does not want Marco to have any contact with Rosie and forges Rosie's name on the release of the jewels. Meanwhile, Rosie and Raju drift apart due to Rosie's incomprehensible behaviour when she tortures Raju by not obliging him a caring hug even and asks him to leave her room else she says she will have to go out. Before this, they also had a discussion about how a man should live when Rosie remembers Marco and tells Raju that Marco was probably correct when he used to say that a man should not live on a woman's earnings. Raju retorts by saying that she is under a misunderstanding that she has become a star on her own and it was only because of Raju's efforts that she became famous. Later, Rosie learns of the forgery release. Raju is convicted of forgery, resulting in a two-year sentence. Rosie does not understand why Raju indulged in forgery, when he could have easily asked her for money. It was not money, it was the loving fascination for Rosie which urged Raju not to reveal Marco's visit to Rosie so that she doesn't remember him again and to eliminate the probability of Rosie and Marco's togetherness, if at all, there was any little chance. On the day of his release, his mother and Rosie come to pick him up but they are told that he was released six months ago because of his good behaviour. Meanwhile, upon his release Raju wanders alone. Despair, poverty, rags, hunger, loneliness engulf him until he finds a wandering group of sadhus (holy men) with whom he spends a night at a derelict temple in a small town.Raju impresses the woman with the logic in taking a husband and she submits, which convinces Bhola that Raju is a swami (holy man). Impressed by this, Bhola spreads the news through the village. Raju is taken as a holy man by the village. Raju assumes the role of village holy man (Swami Ji) and engages in skirmishes with the local pandits.And drama started here. Due to drought Raju was forced to fast for 12 days so that it rains. Meanwhile, his mother, friend and Rosie unite with him and patch things up. In the end it rains but Raju dies. Dev Anand was approached by American director Tad Danielewski and Pearl Buck to be cast in an American film based on a novel by an Indian author. Although Dev Anand had refused, he took up the opportunity for a collaboration when he met Tad again at the 1962 Berlin Film Festival. Somebody suggested The Guide. Dev Anand purchased the book and read it at one go. He called up Pearl who invited him to the United States to discuss the project. With their approval, he called up R. K. Narayan and procured the rights to the book. Pearl tutored Waheeda Rehman on her diction for the English part. But due to differences of opinion between the two production teams, Anand postponed the Hindi version, thereby freeing Chetan Anand to direct Haqeeqat which was later highly acclaimed. It also became an opportunity for Vijay Anand who stepped in, as the film proved a landmark for him. The song, Aaj phir jeene ki tamanna hai which was picturised on Waheeda Rehman was shot in the Chittorgarh Fort in Rajasthan. The climax of the film was shot in Limdi town, 90\u00a0km from Ahmedabad as it has Bhugaro river which flows only during the monsoon. Chetan Anand was a classmate of erstwhile royals of Limdi, Janaksinhji of Jhala family at Doon School in Dehradun, taught English at Limdi, in 1941. The film's music was composed by Sachin Dev Burman, the songs were written by Shailendra and they were sung by Mohammed Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar, Kishore Kumar, Manna Dey and Sachin Dev Burman. The soundtrack was listed by Planet Bollywood as number 11 on their list of 100 Greatest Bollywood Soundtracks. The film was selected as the Indian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 38th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.

The film stars Sunil Dutt, Ashok Kumar, Mala Sinha, Nirupa Roy, Deven Verma and Shashikala. The music was composed by Ravi while the lyrics were by Sahir Ludhianvi. It was remade in Malayalam as Vivahita (1970), starring Padmini, Prem Nazir and Satyan. It was also a hit. It is really surprising that while Shashikala got Filmfare's award in 'Best Supporting Actress Category', Mala Sinha was totally ignored by Film Fare although her role was equally tough and difficult and she gave her one hundred percent share.   Meena (Mala Sinha) and Kamla (Nirupa Roy) are two daughters of a wealthy Nainital resident. While Kamla lives with her established attorney husband, Ashok (Ashok Kumar), in Mumbai, Meena is in love with artist-singer Rajendra (Sunil Dutt). When Kamla comes to Nainital for her delivery, she comes to know of Meena's affair and plans to get her married to Rajendra. Ashok however, is totally unaware of this fact. Before Kamla can do this, she dies after falling off a cliff near her father's home. Afraid that her sister's children will be ill-treated by a stepmother, Meena is compelled to marry Ashok. Ashok does not know about her love affair with Rajendra. For a while things go well, until she meets Rajendra again. He follows her to Mumbai, and they begin meeting secretly. One day, Meena is caught by Leela (Shashikala), a woman who claims to be Rajendra's wife and who begins blackmailing her. Meena's life comes to a crisis, and she is forced to make a choice between Rajendra and Ashok. The movie examines the conflict of a married woman who is caught between her feelings for her lover and her duty to her husband and family. A bold theme for the times (1963), the same conflict is examined again in the 2005 Akshay Kumar-starrer Bewafaa. All music composed by Ravi.",

Deepak Mahan from The Hindu said \"Gunga Jumna is a classic entertainer at its best with a powerful story, outstanding performances and riveting music[...]an eye-opener as to why good stories will always be the real \u201csuper stars\u201d and why content must dictate the form rather than the other way round\".

        "full_text": " Gupt: The Hidden Truth (English: Secret), commonly known as Gupt, is a 1997 Bollywood suspense thriller film, directed by Rajiv Rai. It stars Bobby Deol, Manisha Koirala and Kajol in lead roles, whilst Paresh Rawal, Om Puri and Raj Babbar appear in supporting roles. The film's soundtrack was composed by Viju Shah, while the lyrics were penned by Anand Bakshi. Upon release, Gupt was a commercial success, with its storyline and soundtrack earning critical praise. It grossed \u20b9250 million (US$3.9\u00a0million) at the domestic box office.   Governor Jaisingh Sinha (Raj Babbar) is a popular and prominent local political figure, who is known as an upright person. Sinha presides over a meeting attended by influential industrialist Meghnad Chaudhry (Dalip Tahil), Union leader Vilas Rao (Sharat Saxena) and minister Mantriji (Prem Chopra), among others. The men have a difference of opinion, which leads to a heated argument, and Sinha terminates the meeting without arriving at a decision on the policy. Sinha is the step-father of Sahil Sinha (Bobby Deol), whose mother Sharda (Priya Tendulkar) began to live with Sinha after the death of her husband. Sahil is an unattached and easy-going young man, who harbors resentment towards Sinha, despite living with him. Sinha also has a younger son named Harsh. Ishwar Dewan (Paresh Rawal) is Sinha's Personal Secretary, and his daughter Isha (Kajol) is Sahil's beloved. On the other hand, Sheetal (Manisha Koirala), the daughter of Chaudhry, is also in love with Sahil, but this is not reciprocated by him. One evening, Sinha organizes a party for Sahil's birthday, and he announces Sahil's engagement to Sheetal. Sahil is engaged and an argument breaks out. At one point, a furious Sahil picks up a knife in order to stab his step father, only to be stopped by Sharda. The next day, Sahil gets heavily drunk at the house of Dr Gandhi (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), Sinha's family doctor, who advises Sahil to accept Sheetal as his wife on the grounds that Sahil will lead a happier life with her. An intoxicated Sahil returns home and finds to his shock and horror that someone has stabbed Sinha. Before Sinha can utter the name of the murderer to Sahil, he dies, while Sharda arrives and finds Sahil near his dead step-father holding a knife smeared with blood. Sahil is accused and taken to court, where many of his acquaintances including Chaudhry, Vilas Rao, Mantriji, lawyer Thanawala (Raza Murad) and Sharda testify against him. Sahil is found guilty and sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment. Just before Sahil is transported to jail, he stealthily hands over a necklace to Sheetal, implying that it was left behind at the scene of the crime by the killer. In jail, Sahil relates the story of his false imprisonment to an old prisoner, who believes him to be innocent. The prisoner tells Sahil that the jail only has one escape route - a sewage gutter pipe which extends into the sea. This gutter pipe can be accessed from a flush toilet located in an unused chamber of the jail. Sahil creates a problem with other prisoners, causing the jailor (Tej Sapru) to confine him and two prisoners in the chamber. The three succeed in escaping the jail by sea, with a boat arranged by Sheetal, as previously planned. Police Commissioner Patwardhan (Anjan Srivastav) assigns an unbending and resolute police officer Udham Singh (Om Puri) to handle the case of Sahil's re-apprehension. Udham Singh and two constables Neelkanth (Sadashiv Amrapurkar) and Pandu (Ashok Saraf) start the search for Sahil. Sahil secretly meets Isha at her home, where he calls Dr Gandhi for advice, and Dr Gandhi invites Sahil to his home later that night to discuss the situation. Sahil reaches the doctors residence and is shocked to find that somebody has stabbed Dr Gandhi to death. Dr Gandhi\u2019s servant finds Sahil near the dead doctor and shrieks, causing him to run away. Dr Gandhi\u2019s servant reports Sahil to the police. Udham Singh strengthens the search operation for Sahil and interrogates Sheetal, with whom Sahil still maintains a good relationship. After being persistently questioned by Singh, Sheetal confesses to having spent the previous night with Sahil and also helping him escape jail. Singh does not arrest Sheetal for these wrongdoings, but sarcastically advises her father to get his insane daughter immediately admitted into India\u2019s biggest mental asylum situated in Agra. Sahil, knowing that he has been wrongfully accused of killing Sinha and Dr Gandhi, decides to find the real murderer. He suspects Thanawala of the murders, because Thanawala had every likelihood of obtaining Sinha\u2019s property upon his death, provided Sahil is out of the picture. He violently questions Thanawala and figures the he is not the murderer. Meanwhile, Chaudhry and his brother promise a reward to anybody who informs them of Sahil\u2019s whereabouts. Sahil now finds reasons to suspect Chaudhry or his brother to be the murderer because of Chaudhry's involvement in business fraud. After interrogating him, Sahil realises that Chaudhry is innocent as well. The next target of Sahil is Vilas Rao, the corrupt Union leader, who points the finger at Mantriji, saying that Sinha's murder was a political assassination. Sahil and Sheetal trick Mantriji into attending a ceremony without his security guards, and kidnap him. Udham Singh is also present at the ceremony and realizes that Sahil is not the real murderer. Udham Singh finds out that the two murders have been committed with two knives of exactly the same construction and shape, that could belong to a set. After some investigstions, he finds the set of knives at Ishwar Dewan\u2019s house and arrests Dewan after he confesses to killing Sinha and Dr Gandhi. Dewan divulges to have murdered Sinha because even after years of his fidelity to Sinha as his Personal Secretary, he did not accept Isha as his daughter-in-law; and killed Dr Gandhi to cover up the first crime. At the same time, Sahil interrogates Mantriji in order to elicit the confession from him of being the murderer. Sheetal arrives and tells him that the murderer, none other than Ishwar Dewan, has been arrested, making Sahil release Mantriji. At his house, Udham Singh along with Neelkanth and Pandu celebrate the successful conclusion of this baffling case. Harsh, Sinha's son, is seen playing with the necklace which Sahil had found at the crime scene. He opens the necklace locket and is shocked to find a picture of Isha inside. He figures that Isha is greatly involved in the whole situation. Harsh goes to visit Ishwar, who reveals that Isha had committed the crimes but he doesn't want her to be put in jail, therefore, he falsely confessed. Isha has been stalking Sheetal, and finally attacks her, but Sheetal is saved by Sahil. Enraged by Sahil's concern for Sheetal, Isha behind to attack them but is shot by Udham Singh. Sahil embraces Isha, and he asks her why she committed the murders, as he was always here. Isha replies that she did not have faith in her destiny, and embraces Sahil one last time as she dies in his arms. Most of director Rajiv Rai's (and producer Gulshan Rai's) films are of action-thriller genre that recount the activities of some baddies who carry out tasks detrimental to the society or the country, and to fight whom a righteous person has to adopt the path of crime themself. An intrinsic factor that betokens most of Rai's action-thriller films is the element of uncertainty; everything remains unfathomable, that could be disclosed only at the last minute. The story of the horror-thriller film Gupt revolves around the murder of a political chief and the reason of this murder by an unknown killer remains utterly mysterious. Initially, the murder seems to be familial, i.e., committed by a near and dear one, while later it seems to be a political murder accomplished by a probable enemy of the victim. Some well known villains of Bollywood have played major roles in the film, namely, Prem Chopra, Paresh Rawal, Raza Murad, Harish Patel, Tej Sapru, Sharat Saxena, Dalip Tahil, Vishwajeet Pradhan and Mukesh Rishi. The plot of the film is fashioned in a way that makes the viewers suspect that everyone has an axe to grind in the murder. At the end, the revelation of the killer horrifies the viewers.

        "full_text": " Guru is a 2007 Indian drama film loosely based on the life of Dhirubhai Ambani, a business magnate who founded Reliance Industries. The film was co-written and directed by Mani Ratnam. It stars Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai, R. Madhavan, Vidya Balan, Arya Babbar, and Mithun Chakraborty in the leading roles. The film also has Mallika Sherawat in a guest appearance. The score and soundtrack for the film was composed by A. R. Rahman. The film was dubbed and released simultaneously in Tamil as Guru and in Telugu as Gurukanth. In the Tamil version of the film, the lead role (Abhishek Bachchan) was dubbed by Suriya. The film was released on 12 January 2007 with its premi\u00e8re at the Elgin Theatre in Toronto, Canada, on Thursday 11 January 2007, making it the first Indian film to have a mainstream international premi\u00e8re in Canada. The film was premiered in the Tous Les Cinemas du Monde (World Cinema) section of 2007 Cannes Film Festival.   The beginning of the film is set in 1951 in a small village of Idar in Sabarkantha district, northern Gujarat, where a young man named Gurukant \"Guru\" Desai (Abhishek Bachchan) dreams of making it big some day. His father (Rajendra Gupta), the headmaster of the village school, tells him not to dream and that dreams never come true. Gurukant decides to go to Turkey and enter the spice trade; later, he is promoted but refuses the job, as he wants to work for himself. Back in his village, he marries Sujata (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan), mainly because of the dowry she brings him. Along with Sujata and her brother Jignesh (Arya Babbar), Guru migrates to Bombay and starts trading in cloth. Gradually, he expands his business and sets up manufacturing units of his own, under the name \"Shakti Corporation\". Manik \"Nanaji\" Dasgupta (Mithun Chakraborty), who publishes a newspaper Swatantra, treats Guru as his son. Guru likewise looks upon him as a father figure who gives him support during his early days of struggle in Bombay. He also develops a strong friendship with Meenu (Vidya Balan), granddaughter of Dasgupta. Meenu develops multiple sclerosis as she grows up, and begins using a wheelchair. As Gurukant Desai's business grows into one of the largest in India, he ruthlessly pursues success. He smuggles machine parts for his polyester mills, illegally creates goods, and manipulates stocks to make a higher profit. But when Manik Dasgupta learns that Guru's means of success are not always honest, he, along with a reporter of his newspaper, Shyam Saxena (Madhavan), decide to expose Guru's increasingly corrupt ways. The stress of his battle with the newspaper causes Guru to have a stroke, and he is paralysed on his right side. Meanwhile, Meenu (Vidya Balan), who is now married to Shyam, is slowly weakening from her illness, and eventually dies. In the end, Guru is brought before a private government inquiry on 16 October 1980 to defend himself against the charges pressed against him, but delivers a speech in front of the press the next day that forces the government to clear him of 27 of the 29 charges against him. He is charged with a fine of \u20b96.3 million (equivalent to \u20b9100\u00a0million or US$1.6\u00a0million in 2016) and \u20b996,000 (equivalent to \u20b91.6\u00a0million or US$24,000 in 2016) for the respective 2 charges, which are proved and is allowed to return to his company. Guru was written and directed by Mani Ratnam, while Vijay Krishna Acharya wrote the Hindi dialogues. Filming took place in Mumbai, Turkey, Badami and Melkote (both in Karnataka), as well as in Chennai, Pollachi, Madurai, Chettinad region Tamil Nadu, and Athirappilly in Kerala. Much of the film was shot on the Express Estates, the former home of The New Indian Express and Dinamani. During one musical number, Aishwarya Rai fell from a bicycle and received bruises on her hands and feet. Filming had to be suspended for a few hours while she received first aid and the number was cut from the film and eventually replaced with \"Barso Re\". The music is composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics by Gulzar. Cinematography for the film is handled by Rajiv Menon. Several scenes were deleted from the final theatrical version, including a scene in which Sujata first gives birth to a stillborn child and a scene in which Guru becomes angry with his wife for visiting Manik Dasgupta. Guru has others involved in the production as a film that is reflective of a man's desire for ambition and success, and how times have changed from the period immediately after the country's independence to the present. Some reports have speculated that this film is a biographical film of, one of India's biggest industrial tycoons, Dhirubhai Ambani. Like Guru, Ambani also had roots in Gujarat as the son of a schoolteacher, went abroad to work for the gas company Shell, and returned to India to import polyester. Ratnam has described Guru as inspired by stories both past and present. Guru opened well upon release, gaining momentum over time. In the United States, Guru, opening on a limited release, registered very good collections in its opening weekend, fetching \u20b93 crore (US$460,000) during this period, with a very high screen average. By its seventh week, the film had netted \u20b941.65 crore (US$6.4\u00a0million) in India, collecting \u20b913 crore (US$2.0\u00a0million) in the US and the UK. As of 23 February 2007 Guru, released 12 January has grossed more than \u20b980 crore (US$12\u00a0million) across the world and was declared as \"Hit\". In the United States, it was a blockbuster.[citation needed] Guru has received extremely positive reviews from critics. Abhishek Bachchan received almost unanimous praise for his performance. The film has a rating of 90 percent at the review website Rotten Tomatoes. The New York Times said of the film \"You might think it would be difficult to fashion an entertaining account of the life of a polyester manufacturer, even a fictitious one. But director Mani Ratnam has done so with \"Guru,\u201d an epic paean to can-do spirit and Mumbai capitalism.\" The New York Post gave it three out of four stars, and the Los Angeles Weekly called it the best Hindi film since Lagaan. Richard Corliss of Time compared the film to Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life and said that one of the main highlights of the film was its climax. This Guru is more like a fine polyester. He further noted, \"Ash's film eminence remains a mystery. No question she's pretty, but she's more an actress-model than a model actress. In Guru she's mainly ornamentation\". The Hindustan Times reviewer gave it a three and half stars and noted \" Ratnam and Bachchan Jr have given you a film that\u2019s as close to life as say, business is to politics. For the discerning viewer, satisfaction is guaranteed.. and some more. Aishwarya Rai is marvellous, handling complex scenes with grace and empathy. Above all, the enterprise belongs to Abhishek Bachchan. He is astonishingly nuanced and unwaveringly forceful in his career-best performance after Yuva. \" Critic Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama gave a four star rating and claimed in his review that \"Guru ranks as one of Mani Ratnam's finest efforts and one of the best to come out of Hindi cinema,\" and praised actors performances writing \"Reserve all the awards for Abhishek. No two opinions on that! His performance in GURU is world class and without doubt. From a sharp teenager in Turkey to the biggest entrepreneur of the country, Abhishek handles the various shades this character demands with adroitness.\" Raja Sen from Rediff gave a three stars said that \"Guru is fuelled by a slew of strong performances. Abhishek Bachchan owns the movie, forcing audiences to sit up straight as it begins and making us laugh and applaud as he carries on. He's impressive in every frame, as he ebulliently takes over an alien room by hopping onto a chair, or when he's trying to be ever so slightly slimy, polishing his spectacles and showing off his smarminess\". Daily News and Analysis reviewer gave a three star rating and cited \" Guru is a film that enthralls you for most of its running time as it traces the life of the uncannily forward seeing bumpkin from Gujarat who turns every disadvantage into an advantage. With Guru, Abhishek Bachchan has finally learnt the nuances of the grammar of cinema, in what will very likely be his defining film\". Sify gave its verdict as \"Very Good\" and stated \"Mani Ratnam\u2019s Guru is undoubtedly a gutsy and outstanding film. Outstanding performance is extracted from everyone in the cast.\" The Hindu cited that \"'Guru' is vintage Mani Ratnam. It encapsulates his characteristic canniness about human nature, specifically relationships. This is considered Abhishek Bachchan's role of a lifetime.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave four stars explaining \"The beauty of Mani Ratnam's cinema is truly in its unpredictability. Few filmmakers can translate their personal vision onto screen the way Mani Ratnam can. So that's two thumbs up for Guru \u2013 it's a must-watch for all. Of the film's cast, Mithun Chakraborty playing the ruthless newspaper baron, deserves mention for the dignity which he brings to the part, one that's clearly inspired by Indian Express founder Ramnath Goenka. The actor in this film who truly blew my mind, is Aishwarya Rai. There is a silent grace, quiet nobility to her performance,which I have to admit I've never seen before. Of course the film belongs to Abhishek Bachchan, the protagonist, Guru himself. And in all honesty, Abhishek rises to the challenge like never before. \" The Sunday Times stated \"It is certainly one of the best Bollywood movies you will see. Performances attract admiration: Bachchan does a De Niro, piling on the dosas to show the ageing and overweight Guru and he is, surprisingly, impressive. Rai sheds her usual doe-eyed expressions and is endearing as the supportive but fiery wife, who looks and dances like an angel. Chakraborty and Tamil superstar Madhavan shine equally brightly in underwritten supporting roles\". BBC reviewer Jaspreet Pandohar gave it a three star rating and noted \"Ratnam's absorbing screenplay ensures that Guru rises above the usual rags to riches story, by weaving in meaty subplots involving the protagonist's complex relationships with his loyal wife (Aishwarya Rai), friends and foes\". The highly acclaimed and extremely successful soundtrack for this film is composed by A. R. Rahman. All songs were colossal hits and the whole album, despite stiff competition from other albums, remained on top for several months and was chosen as the best album for the year 2006. For his highly acclaimed and successful work in this film, A. R. Rahman received both \"Best Music\" and \"Best Background Score\" awards in \"Filmfare awards\" as well as \"IIFA awards\".",

        "full_text": " Haider is a 2014 Indian crime drama film directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, and co-written by Basharat Peer and Bhardwaj. It stars Shahid Kapoor as the titular protagonist, and co-stars Tabu, Shraddha Kapoor and Kay Kay Menon. Irrfan Khan appears in an extended special appearance. The film is a modern-day adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet and Curfewed Night of Basharat Peer set amidst the insurgency-hit Kashmir conflicts of 1995 and civilian disappearances. Haider, a young student and a poet, returns to Kashmir at the peak of the conflict to seek answers about his father's disappearance and ends up being tugged into the politics of the state. Haider is the third installment of Bhardwaj's Shakespearean trilogy after Maqbool (2003) and Omkara (2006). The film was screened at the 19th Busan International Film Festival, and released worldwide on 2 October 2014 to wide critical acclaim, and garnered attention from the media due to its controversial subject matter. The direction, performances of Kay Kay Menon, Tabu and Shahid Kapoor, screenplay, film score and editing received praise and garnered several accolades. Haider was the first Indian film to win the People's Choice Award at the Rome Film Festival. Among several awards and nominations in India, the film won five National Film Awards: Best Male Playback Singer, Best Dialogue, Best choreography, Best Costume Design, and Best Music Direction.   In 1995, during the insurgency in Kashmir, Hilaal Meer (Narendra Jha), a doctor, agrees to perform an appendectomy on the leader of a pro-separatist militant group. To avoid detection, he performs the surgery at his house, much to the chagrin of his wife Ghazala (Tabu), who questions his allegiance. The following day, during a military raid, Hilaal is accused of harbouring terrorists. A shootout ensues at his home, during which the leader of the separatist group is killed and Hilaal is taken away for questioning. The doctor's house is bombed subsequently to kill any other militant hiding inside. Several days later, Hilaal and Ghazala's son, Haider (Shahid Kapoor), returns from his Aligarh Muslim University to seek answers about his father's disappearance. Upon arrival, he is shocked to find his mother singing and laughing along with her brother-in-law, Khurram (Kay Kay Menon). Unable to understand his mother's behaviour, he begins searching for his father in various police stations and detention camps with the help of his childhood sweetheart Arshi (Shraddha Kapoor), a journalist. Saddened by the growing closeness between Ghazala and Khurram, and unable to find any leads, Haider begins to lose hope. However, Arshi encounters a stranger, Roohdar, who asks her to inform Haider that he will be able to provide information about Hilaal. Haider contacts Roohdar (Irrfan), who turns out to be part of a separatist group. Roohdar then narrates the story of how he met Hilaal in one of the detention centers, where they both were tortured. Hilaal attributes his imprisonment to his brother, Khurram. Roohdaar then tells the story of how Haider's father was brutally murdered by Khurram's made up terrorist group and how he survived after being shot and thrown into the river, which stopped his bleeding and allowed him to escape. Roohdaar then tells Haider that he simply wanted to pass on his father's message to him: revenge for Khurram's betrayal. Thereafter, angry and swearing to avenge the injustice done to his father, Haider breaks down at his father's gravesite and becomes mentally and emotionally shattered. He starts to suffer from the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, shaving his head and behaving strangely. Khurram, after learning of the meeting between Haider and Roohdar, tells him that Roohdar was the one who killed his father. Haider is now confused as to whom to believe despite knowing the truth himself, and discloses his dilemma to Arshi, adding that Roohdar gave him a gun to kill his uncle. Arshi confides this to her father who informs Khurram about the gun. Khurram immediately orders his men to send Haider to a mental institution. The following morning, Haider is all set to kill his uncle but cannot accomplish it because his uncle is offering prayers and his morals prevent it. Haider is captured by Arshia's father who orders him to be executed, but Haider manages to escape, although not before mercilessly killing his captors. He contacts Roohdar, who suggests getting trained in Pakistan to avenge his father's death, and Haider agrees. He calls his mother and informs her about it to which she asks him to meet her once before going to the other side of border. During the meeting, Ghazala discloses that she had told Khurram about the terrorists hiding in their house not knowing that he was an informer of the Indian army. Arshi's father traces them and is about to shoot Haider when Haider shoots him dead and escapes. Tormented by her father's death at the hands of Haider, Arshia is emotionally traumatized and commits suicide. Meanwhile, Ghazala finds Roohdar's contact number from Arshia's diary and calls him. Haider goes to his pickup point, the graveyard where his father was buried. At the graveyard, Haider contemplates about the universal nature of mortality. On seeing Arshia's brother Liyaqat in the graveyard, he realises that the corpse is of Arshia. He runs towards her body where her brother sees him and informs Khurram. A fight ensues between Haider and Arshi's brother, resulting in the latter's death. Khurram arrives with full force and a gunfight ensues; meanwhile Roohdar drops Ghazala at the graveyard. A fierce exchange of bullets and bombs leaves only Haider and few men on Khurram's side alive. Just when Khurram is about to kill Haider, Ghazala pleads for a chance to convince Haider to surrender. She confronts her son who says that he cannot die before avenging his father's death. Ghazala tells him that revenge only results in revenge and there is no end to this cycle, but Haider, who is bent on revenge, does not understand. Ghazala kisses Haider goodbye and steps outside, only to reveal that she is wearing a suicide vest (given to her by Roohdar). Khurram and Haider rush towards her but she pulls the pins of the hand grenade resulting in a big explosion, killing herself along with the rest of Khurram's men and gravely injuring Khurram himself, while Haider is only slightly thrown back from the force of the explosion. Haider goes to his mother's remains, weeps by her side and goes to kill Khurram, whose legs have been severed from his body. He is reminded of his mother's words that \"revenge only results in revenge\" and thus decides to let Khurram live. Khurram begs Haider to kill him to free him from the burden of guilt and to avenge his father's death, but Haider doesn't oblige Khurram, instead ignores him and leaves. Initially, Vishal Bhardwaj and Shahid Kapoor were in talks of making a sequel to their blockbuster film, Kaminey (2009). The project was put on hold and a new project with Kapoor in the lead was confirmed, titled as Haider, which was reportedly based on an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Hamlet. The adaptation was made to portray the political intrigue and history of Kashmir as well as the play's sexual conflicts. Bhardwaj was initially developing the play as a contemporary espionage thriller with author Stephen Alter. They wrote a 30-page synopsis that was sent to Gulzar. Though Gulzar liked the synopsis but enquired Bhardwaj of the missing tragedy of Hamlet in the penned thriller. The synopsis had incomplete details about the life, authenticity and Official Secrets Act of RAW agents. On his return to India, Bharadwaj's wife Rekha Bhardwaj was reading Basharat Peer's memoir, Curfewed Night, a book based on life in violence-wracked Kashmir. His wife was deeply moved after reading the book. Bharadwaj didn't immediately read the book but was aware about its content. Later, Bhardwaj desired to change the synopsis. Remembering Basharat's book, he contacted him and they started the work. Bhardwaj quoted importance of Basharat in the film as, \"If Basharat was not a part of the film, Haider wouldn't be made or it wouldn't be made this way.\" The film is Peer's first film project. On co-scripting the same, he stated that writing Curfewed Night was a response to caricatures of Kashmiris in Indian political writing whereas he wrote Haider in the same spirit, with the same feeling with Bhardwaj. Bhardwaj and he agonised a lot over the soliloquies required. There were sections of the To be, or not to be speech that was translated directly in Hindi. Due to constraints of time they had to omit the Apparel maketh a man soliloquy though. They retained and translated the section where \"Hamlet\" meets Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and speaks about Denmark being in prison. Further, new soliloquies were created to convey \"Hamlet\"'s madness and the veiled political satire in it. This was brought in when \"Haider\" with his head shaved, dressed in torn, shabby clothes rants on a traffic roundabout in Srinagar and apart from a few senseless jokes, reads out the bare act of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. Apart from this, Peer explained that an adaptation doesn't exactly follow the original, like the part of Fortinbras was barely there in Haider. The world of King Claudius and Polonius is portrayed as the counter-insurgency and government-run, counter-insurgent militias in Haider and thematically dominates the action. As per the story of the book Hamlet, an Oedipus complex exists that draws \"Hamlet\" (played by Shahid Kapoor) towards his mother \"Gertrude\" (played by Tabu) that could have been interpreted both at a physical and psychological level, however, Bhardwaj kept this reference subtle as the target audience was predominantly Indian and called it 'one of the aspects in this mother-son relationship.' In his previous outing of Othello's adaptation, Omkara (2006), he removed the last monologue due to the fact that it was more suited for a stage play sequence but retained that type of monologue for Haider. Shahid Kapoor learnt a six-page monologue for the climatic scene where his character \"Haider\" turns mad. He put forth the delivery of that monologue in front of a crowd of 5000 listening. For filming the scene, which was done in 3\u20134 hours, Shahid Kapoor was made completely bald. Sumit Kaul, who played the character of one of the Salmans, was involved in training the Kashmiri accent of actress Tabu apart from lead actors Shahid and Shraddha. His portions of filming were canned in fifteen days, however, he was with the team for two and a half months in Kashmir. He taught the nuances of the language especially when it translates into English or Hindi. Kaul also helped actress Tabu get the enunciation when she sang the folk song \"Roshe Valle\" that was a part of the film score. \"Ghazala is torn between her idealistic husband, opportunistic brother-in-law, and her innocent and passionate son. Somewhere she feels she has the responsibility to keep everything in control but obviously she can't. Her love for her son is crazy. She is always trying to protect him from being misled and misguided. He (Bhardwaj) cast me as Shahid's mother because he wanted the oddity of the relationship to come out which wouldn't have come across with a regular aged mother and son combination. Haider shares a love/hate relationship with Ghazala but it's a very passionate emotion. You almost feel odd that these two are mom and son. Haider's predicament is that he doesn't know what to do with his mother\u2014whether to love her, hate her, believe her, or kill her.\" Kapoor, along with Bhardwaj and UTV Motion Pictures, each have a 33.3% share in the film. The budget for the film is \u20b9390 million (US$6.0\u00a0million) taking into account \u20b9240 million (US$3.7\u00a0million) spent into the production of the film and \u20b9150 million (US$2.3\u00a0million) for promotions. Dolly Ahluwalia has designed costumes for the film. She began working by creating Kashmiri designs of costumes in Delhi. When Vishal Bhardwaj and his film's cinematographer were doing a recce in the valley of Kashmir, she was there to share her creative vision with him. She took her sketches and swatches there. After that, she returned to Delhi and continued with her work there. Instead of picking up costumes easily available in bazaars of Kashmir, she designed the phirans for Shahid Kapoor, hijabs and head scarves for both Shraddha Kapoor and Tabu. Ahluwalia was quoted saying, \"Somewhere along the way her husband disappears and she marries his brother who is wealthier than him and this change in marital status is explained through richer colors and fabrics.\" She added that her real challenge was exploring the psyche of the character \"Haider\" through colors, textures and cuts. The signs of madness in his character are depicted through the pom-poms in his cap during the track \"Bismil\" that is a manifestation of the traditional folk dance Dumhal of the Kashmiri valley performed by Wattal tribes. For the costumes seen in climax portions, she was quoted saying, \"Against that white snow backdrop I stuck to black and reds to bring out the cold of the human mind through the cold snow and the death of romance in blood red hues.\" Haider was shot in two parts. The first schedule was in November\u2013December 2013 and then next in January\u2013February 2014. Keeping the weather conditions in consideration, the first part of the film is shot in Autumn-Winter and the second part featuring intense drama and action sequences under snow. The entire filming was completed in 54 days. Principal photography began at Dal lake in November 2013. Haider was filmed at Pahalgam, Kehribal area in Anantnag, Mattan, Aishan Sahab Zaina Kadal Bridge in old Srinagar, Nishat Bagh, Dal Lake, Qazigund, Martand Sun Temple, Naseem Bagh (at Kashmir University Garden), Hazratbal and Sonamarg, all of which are located in Jammu and Kashmir Bhardwaj was forced to pack up after a group of Kashmir University students disrupted shooting of a sequence of a Fedayeen attack which was being canned at the University of Kashmir at Hazratbal. The students objected to the hoisting of the national flag atop a makeshift bunker. A few students objected to the shooting of a few scenes and started \"pro-freedom\" slogans, dismantling the stage. The youngsters also forced them out of the shooting location in Naseem Bagh (Kashmir University Garden) despite heavy security, claiming that they had no idea about the shoot happening on that location. Students of University raised also objection to Irrfan Khan when he was spotted smoking inside the campus. The last schedule of filming for 'Haider' began in Kashmir in January 2014. For the song \"Bismil\" that was shot at Martand Sun Temple in Kashmir, Shahid Kapoor was quoted saying, \"It is one of the best shot songs of my career. The location, the elements like face paint to depict war situations, have been used in 'Bismil'. Then there are 100 feet tall puppets, which I have never seen in any song before.\" For the choreography Bhardwaj was very keen that Shahid's character didn't have any dance movements that Shahid did in his previous films as it was required for the character's angst and feelings. Bhardwaj recruited a Norway-based choreographer for the choreography of this track. The shooting of the film was also halted briefly for a second time in Zainakadal in Srinagar in January 2014, when a spectator threw coal towards the actors. Filming was completed by 24 February 2014. After 41 cuts, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) gave the film U/A certificate. The scenes that were censored were a truck load of corpses, wire being inserted inside a naked man, a shot of a bloody dead body, abusive words. Apart from this, a shot of a bare back during the song \"Khul Kabhi To\" was also considered offensive and censored. The Central Board of Film Certification demanded deletion of a scene where \"Haider\" (played by Shahid Kapoor) cries on seeing flames. A confusion arose when Kumar along with an examining committee saw the film and prescribed the cuts. After the film was re-edited, instead of sending it to the revising committee for reviewing, Kumar himself watched the film again and gave it a U/A certificate. Nandini Sardesai, a member of the revising committee told The Times of India that Kumar saw Haider twice and passed it with a U/A certificate. She stated that director of the film Vishal Bhardwaj had apparently agreed to the cuts. Later, Bhardwaj clarified that the CBFC only demanded seven cuts but gave his film 35 extra cuts in order to make the script look more realistic. Bhardwaj added that since the film is set in Kashmir and given the associated troubled politics of the state, he knew the film would land in controversies. The controversy over film's plot, analysts stated that India has become more open to sensitive subjects. Dr. Zakir Hussain, a senior analyst at the Indian Council of World Affairs was quoted saying, \"As democratic traditions strengthen in the country, more and more such movies will be made and people will be educated. Haider is the first step in that direction.\" Director Bhardwaj faced criticism over the depiction of the armed forces in an allegedly unfair way as the film also portrayed scenes of torture in Indian army camps and abuse of human rights by Indian officials. To this portrayal, Indian Twitter users, filled with sentiments brought up hashtagging of words \"#BoycottHaider\" that generated estimate 75,000 tweets since the film release. In reply to this criticism, people on Twitter started trending #HaiderTrueCinema which trended for 2 days and this caused #BoycottHaider to be withdrawn from the list of trending Topics on Twitter. The original songs and film score are composed by Vishal Bhardwaj. The soundtrack has nine songs whose lyrics are penned by Gulzar, except for two songs \"Gulon Mein Rang Bhare\" and \"Aaj Ke Naam\" that were written by Faiz Ahmed Faiz. Shahid Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor launched the music of the film along with Vishal Bhardwaj at Radio Mirchi studios in Mumbai by mid-August 2014. The soundtrack had a digital as well as physical release on 15 September 2014. The film score was digitally released on 2 October 2014. The film received critical acclaim worldwide. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% of 6 professional critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.7 out of 10. On Metacritic, the film has an 83 user score based on 15 ratings. Writing for The Hindu, Sudhish Kamath felt, \"Lyricist Gulzar, writer-director Vishal Bhardwaj, and writer Basharat Peer have given us an instant classic, a literary epic (the screenplay is out in the stores too) with a lesson to learn from recent history. Haider is an incredibly brave uncompromising film made with loads of conviction with blatant disregard to market conventions, one that will make you cheer during the meta-moment in the film.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN called that film an elegant, thrilling one that casts a brave, unflinching eye on the Kashmir struggle. He noted, \"In deviating from the original ending of Hamlet, it also makes a necessary point about the cyclical nature of revenge and violence.He gave the movie 4/5 stars\" Writing for Deccan Chronicle, Kusumita Das who compared the film to the book summarized, \"Considering Hamlet, with all its complexity, is certainly not an easy adaptation to venture into \u2013 that alone could well make this Vishal's finest film yet.\" Mohar Basu of Koimoi detailed out performances, direction, script, editing and screenplay gave the verdict, \"Haider is an unforgettable film that never fumbles, never stumbles, and is so sure of itself that it cannot go wrong. From Shahid to Tabu to Kay Kay to the powerful cameo of Irrfan, everything in the film works. It's a Guztaq film that audaciously breaks every rule in the book, everything that you could have expected from it and ends up being that edgy watch which you'll savor, while you watch it from the edge of seats. Haider is Chutzpah and inkeeping with the same vein, I will rate this film the highest I have ever gone with a movie. This is an easy 4.5/5.\" Critic Subhash K. Jha with immense praise felt, \"Haider is a beast that just won't be tamed by regular cinematic definitions. There is flamboyance and subtlety, both at once in the treatment. Elegance and earthiness rub shoulders in the execution of what is regarded as one of Shakespeare's most complex tragedies. Above all, there are the performances \u2013 towering, luminous actors craning their collective creative necks into the director's vision, to give it mesmerising magical spin. Mr Bhardwaj's third Shakespearean sojourn is his best yet. Haider is like a painting viewed from the road inside an art gallery. The vision is distant yet vivid, layered life-like and yet exquisitely poetic.\" Critic Raja Sen of Rediff gave the film a maximum of five stars and wrote: \"Haider is one of the most powerful political films we've ever made, a bonafide masterpiece that throbs with intensity and purpose\". Writing for Mid Day, Shubha Shetty-Saha said \"Vishal Bharadwaj brings alive the ecstasy, pain and passion of Hamlet on screen, he also reminds us of the harsh truth in our own backyard, the man-made mayhem in the God-made jannat [heaven] that is Kashmir\". Faheem Ruhani for India Today praised the Even the oedipal theme between characters played by Shahid Kapoor and Tabu, summarizing his review as, \"Haider may seem a bit sluggish in the first half and slightly long. However, it makes up for most of it in the dramatic, intense climax that you are treated to towards the end. Haider is definitely a film you should not miss.\" Zee News's critic Ritika Handoo reviewed positively, \"William Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' is a masterpiece in literature, and Vishal Bhardwaj's 'Haider' will be talked about in the same vein as one such artistic product in cinematic history. Haider will be recognised as Shahid's career-best performance.\" Srijana Mitra Das of The Times of India called the film \"one of cinema's bravest takes on identity, frightening, yet fun\" and particularly praised Tabu's performance whom she considered the prime asset of the film. Sweta Kaushal for Hindustan Times noted, \"Vishal Bhardwaj's Haider is a rare Bollywood gem you must watch.\" Writing for Filmfare magazine, Rachit Gupta felt, \"Haider doesn't have an ounce of the commercial thrills and spills that entertain the 100-crore masses. But it does have an undeniable dramatic punch. It is one of the best stories you'll every watch on celluloid. Give this edgy film a chance to entertain you. Because it will do so with aplomb. It's certainly better than the other chutzpah out there.\" On the contrary, critic Shubhra Gupta at the The Indian Express felt the story-telling falters, quoting that, \"It is a gorgeous but choppy film that you cannot take your eyes off for fear of losing another exquisite piece of detailing; it is also one that fails to fully keep you with it.\" Aaj Tak has published a review of the movie by an Indian Army Officer that analyses the movie from a soldier's standpoint. He claims this movie has anti-India pro-Separatist tone which portrays Indian Army in bad light. Mike McHill of the The Guardian wrote, \"Radical Indian version of Hamlet gives the story compelling political angles and musical surprises. A palpable hit, in any language.\" Rachel Saltz of The New York Times titled her critical review as, \"Shakespearean Revenge in a Violent Kashmir\" emphasizing more on script and directorial aspects, noting, \"Haider may not be the equal of Mr. Bhardwaj's other Shakespeare films, and it may be deficient in the \"Hamlet\" department, but it certainly gives good Gertrude.\" At The Hollywood Reporter, Lisa Tsering was more positive on the film, summarizing, \"With Haider, Bhardwaj wisely forgoes the rough-edged attitude in his other films to embrace a slicker and more sophisticated style; and some of the film's most effective moments are masterful in their visual storytelling skill.\" Writing for Digital Spy, Priya Joshi praised the movie, calling it a 'masterclass in film-making and performance' and 'an exemplary cinema and a work of great artistic merit.' She added, \"Shahid Kapoor is a standard-bearer for a generation.\" Suprateek Chatterjee of the Firstpost praised performances of Shahid Kapoor and Tabu thereby calling Vishal Bharadwaj's film 'best movie so far'. Praising the key aspects of the movie, critic Manjusha Radhakrishnan for Gulf News writes, \"Everything about Haider is subtle: including the undertones of the infamous sexual tension between mother and son. Tabu and Kapoor surrender themselves completely to their roles and are endearingly uninhibited. The pace is never hurried, so be a bit patient and give these superbly talented actors a chance. Just like the cinematography that captures Kashmir's rugged beauty, Haider will wow you with its raw appeal.\" On writing for Emirates 24/7, Sneha May Francis opined, \"Haider does appear a little over indulgent, but considering Vishal had such a Herculean task at hand, it's just a small price to pay for good cinema. Shakespearean tragedy Hamlet gets a sinfully delightful adaptation by master filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj\". Ryan Gilbey based at New Statesman claimed, \"The idea of a Bollywood Hamlet throws up all manner of preconceptions. But Haider transpires to be a far less irreverent interpretation than, say, the 2000 US version in which Ethan Hawke delivered the \"To be or not to be\" soliloquy from the \"Action\" section of Blockbuster Video. Bhardwaj relocates the action to Kashmir in the mid-1990s. If the graft doesn't quite take, it's because the film is so persuasive in portraying the oppression of the Kashmiri people that the woes of Hamlet seem small beer.\" Haider collected \u20b9583 million (US$9.0\u00a0million) from domestic screens after its third week in theatres.[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] The film was released in nearly 1250 screens all over India where it collected \u20b961.4 million (US$950,000) on its release date (Thursday).

The film stars Sunil Dutt, Raaj Kumar, Mumtaz, Sarika, Madan Puri, Iftekhar, Balraj Sahni, Jeevan, Helen and Vimi. The film's music is by Ravi, while the lyrics were penned by Sahir Ludhianvi.   Kumar (Sunil Dutt) is a well-known stage actor in Bombay, who performs plays along with his partner Shabhnam (Mumtaz). While on a trip to scenic Darjeeling, he meets and falls in love with Meena (Vimi), the only daughter of a wealthy military contractor, Verma (Manmohan Krishna). Shortly thereafter, Kumar and Meena get married and return home to Bombay. Four years later, Meena's dad passes away after telling her something that he had hidden. Soon, Kumar notices that Meena does not accompany him to the stage any more, and excuses herself on the pretext of being ill. He finds clues that suggest that she is meeting somebody else on the sly. Suspicious, Kumar makes the excuse of going to Pune, and instead dons a beard and goes by the name of S.N. Sinha. He checks into a hotel, and writes his name in the hotel register. That night, he returns to his home, to find the door open, and before he can investigate anything, he hears a gunshot. Kumar runs into the room and finds Meena dead, shot in her chest. Enraged, he decides to call the police station, but realizes that he will be implicated in the murder - his fingerprints are on the gun, he is in disguise, and he is next to the body. Kumar returns to the hotel instead, and smokes a lot of cigarettes. The case is assigned to Inspector Ashok (Balraj Sahni), and the next day, when Kumar \"returns\" to Bombay, Ashok observes that Kumar knows which room the body is in, without being told by anyone. The coconut seller near Kumar's house says that he saw a bearded man in the area the night of the murder, and the owner of the hotel which Kumar had checked into calls the police, saying that a bearded man had checked into his hotel. The cigarettes that Kumar had smoked are recovered, and handed over to Ashok. When he visits Kumar at his house the next day, Kumar offers him the same brand of cigarette, rousing his suspicion. Soon, more clues surface, pointing at Kumar as the killer. In a fit of haste, Kumar decides to run away from the growing suspicion of Inspector Ashok. His friend, lawyer Jagmohan (Iftekhar), says that he will now definitely be implicated as the murderer of Meena. Desperate, he finds a clue about the suspected killer from his home - a key with room number of a hotel. Kumar visits the room as a last attempt to clear things before he is caught. There, he meets Captain Rajesh who calms him down and tells him that none of them is the real killer. He tells Kumar that he is his wife's first husband, who was supposedly killed on the front, and how he wanted her to acquire their illegitimate child, Sarika, because she wouldn't be able to raise a child born out of wedlock. Captain Rajesh tells Kumar that whoever the killer is, he was seen by Sarika because she was present in the room where Meena was murdered while both mother and daughter were playing and their activities being recorded by a video camera. Together, they try to find the girl, eventually tracing her to Ooty. Unknown to them, Inspector Ashok is on their trail. Soon, they both are arrested by him with the help of Ooty Police. Kumar explains his case, and they try to find Sarika, and she is at the house of a man called Tejpal (Madan Puri), who tries to run away from there. Shabnam and Jagmohan arrive with the videotape of the night that Meena was murdered. It is revealed that Tejpal is the killer, but he quickly draws a gun and picks up Sarika, threatening to kill her should any of them try to stop him. Captain Rajesh manages to save Sarika from Tejpal, but he is shot twice by the latter. Now free to attack him, Ashok draws his gun and shoots Tejpal, and Kumar rushes over to Captain Rajesh. Tejpal is killed by Ashok and Sarika is safe. Captain Rajesh dies, and at the end of the movie, Kumar tells Shabnam that he cannot work - Meena was his only inspiration. Shabnam shows him Sarika sitting in Meena's seat, and he embraces Shabnam. The music was composed by Ravi, and the lyrics were penned by Sahir Ludhianvi.

        "full_text": " Hare Rama Hare Krishna is a 1971 Indian film directed by Dev Anand starring himself, Mumtaz and Zeenat Aman. The film was a hit and a star-making vehicle for Zeenat Aman, who played a westernized hippie, and won the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award, as well as the BFJA Award for Best Actress. The movie dealt with the decadence of the Hippie culture. It aimed to have an anti-drug message and also depicts some problems associated with Westernization such as divorce. It is loosely based on the 1968 movie Psych-Out. The story for Hare Rama Hare Krishna actually came to Dev Anand's mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values in Kathmandu, Nepal where he was on a visit after protests against his previous film Prem Pujari in Calcutta. He was low in spirits because his film had been opposed and some had burnt Prem Pujari's posters.[citation needed]   In the background of the rise of the International Hare Krishna movement in the 1970s, is a Montreal-based family of the Jaiswals, consisting of mom, dad, son, Prashant, and daughter, Jasbir. Due to differences, Mr and Mrs Jaiswal separate, leaving Jasbir with dad, and Prashant with his mom. Eventually Prashant and his mom travel to India, leaving father and daughter behind in Montreal. Mr. Jaiswal remarries, and brings his new wife to live in his home. Jasbir is told by her nanny that her mother & brother are dead. Back in India Prashant is sent to a boarding school and his father makes sure that none of Prashant's letters reach Jasbir, so that it would be easy on her part to get over emotional trauma. Jasbir is upset with her inconsiderate step-mother and ignorant father who is deeply immersed in his business. Years later, Prashant has grown up to be a pilot. He has received a letter from his dad that Jasbir, who had rebelled and left home, is now located in Kathmandu, Nepal, with a group of hippies. Prashant decides to find his sister and hopefully get her back to the family. When Prashant lands in Kathmandu he does not find Jasbir, but instead finds Janice, who is indeed his sister with a new name. Janice has no recollection of her childhood, and is always in the company of hippies spending most of her time consuming alcohol & drugs with them. Janice lives with the hippies in the property rented out by local landlord Drona. Drona's real business is stealing ancient artifacts from Kathmandu and selling it to foreign nationals. Michael, one of the hippies, is the one who does all the dirty work for him. Janice's boyfriend Deepak misunderstands that Prashant is trying to woo Janice, hence they exchange a few blows every time they meet. Meanwhile Drona has an eye on Shanti, a local salesgirl working in one of the shops owned by him. Shanti has feelings for Prashant which creates one more enemy for him. Later Prashant and Shanti elope and get married. At the same time a precious idol is stolen from local temple by Michael, which he hides in Janice's house. Prashant secretly observes all this. Drona tries to frame Shanti for theft by secretly planting another stolen artifact in her house. Later he spreads the word that since the day Prashant has arrived idols are being stolen and he is stalking local girls. The police commissioner is a friend of Prashant's father, and has already received a letter stating the purpose of Prashant's visit to Kathmandu. He suspects that Drona is trying to frame Prashant because he has married Shanti. He gets a search warrant for the entire property of Drona and recovers a diary which has contact details of his friends abroad who help him sell the stolen artifacts. The police also recover the stolen artifact from Shanti's home, squarely blaming Prashant for it. Shanti is deeply hurt by this and looks around for Prashant. Prashant meanwhile is with Janice, trying to convince her that he is her brother, who she had been told dead long back. Michael overhears the conversation & conspires to put the blame on the brother-sister duo. Taking advantage of the situation Drona and Michael instigate the locals against Prashant by framing him for the theft and duping Shanti under pretext of marriage. The hippies and the locals are now ready to bash Prashant the moment they come across him. When Prashant again tries to meet Janice, the hippies give him a solid thrashing. The police commissioner intervenes and Prashant is saved. At the same time real face of Drona is uncovered and he meets his end trying to run away from police. Janice sees that both her parents have arrived to meet her and realizes that Prashant is indeed her brother. Janice is deeply hurt that her parents had to see her in this state. She runs away from them and commits suicide. In her suicide note she tells Prashant how deeply she loved him and she never intended him to find her in this state and suicide was the only way out for her. The music of the film was composed by Rahul Dev Burman and the lyrics were written by Anand Bakshi. The songs, \"Dum Maro Dum\" and \u201cHare Rama Hare Krishna\u201d were instant hits with the youth even as \u201cKanchi re kanchi re\u201d, \u201cDekho o diwano\u201d and \u201cPhoolon ka taron ka\u201d showed the versatility of composer R.D.

Revolving around the life of a once successful film actress whose career is on the decline, the film features Kareena Kapoor as the protagonist along with actors Arjun Rampal, Randeep Hooda and Rakesh Bapat. Additionally, the project also stars Shahana Goswami, Divya Dutta, Helen, Shillpi Sharma, Mugdha Godse and Lillete Dubey in supporting roles. Heroine released on 21 September 2012 across 2000 screens. Box Office Collection marked Bhandarkar's film and Faisal Saif's Jigyaasa as better made films till date with Bollywood used as a backdrop.   The movie begins with Mahi Arora (Kareena Kapoor), a renowned actress and film heroine, being thrown out of a car at night. She hails a taxi to a police station with the intention of lodging a complaint. Before she can do so, her agent Rashid Bhai (Govind Namdeo) arrives and takes her away from the station. Through a flashback, we are shown Mahi's relationship with well-known leading actor, Aryan (Arjun Rampal). Aryan is going through divorce proceedings with his wife, while dating Mahi. Mahi is completely in love with Aryan, and during one of their intimate moments, takes a video of them. Aryan's loyalty and priorities are split between his wife and son, his career, and Mahi. When Mahi comes to know about an intimate scene Aryan is shooting for a movie, she barges on to the set and creates a scene, which upsets Aryan. Later Mahi is mocked by Aryan's wife at a party, and they exchange heated words. While driving back from the party with Aryan, Mahi raises the topic of his wife, which results in her being thrown out of the car. Realising her place in Aryan's life, Mahi goes into depression, putting her career in jeopardy. A friend convinced Mahi to leave the past behind her and re-enter the industry with a bang. Heeding her advice, Mahi decides to rejuvenate her career. She employs a Public Relations Offiver, Pallavi (Divya Dutta) who reinvents Mahi's image and puts her back on the front page of every newspaper and magazine. She starts a relationship with an upcoming cricketer, Angad Paul (Randeep Hooda). Their love affair begins to blossom and puts her back into the spotlight. Mahi uses Angad to get role in a big budget film. However, the lead actor manipulates the director to shoot the film in such a way, that the story becomes purely about him and an item girl. Mahi is dissatisfied despite the film being a success, and in a desperate attempt to prove her acting skills, she works in an art film for next the nine months. Angad proposes to Mahi, but she feels that presently they should concentrate on their respective careers. This causes Mahi and Angad's relationship to end. The art film never completes, and Mahi goes into depression, accompanied by heavy drinking and smoking. Since she cannot get a role in big budget productions, she decides to work on a low budget film with newcomers. Also she agrees to make an appearance at the marriage of a wealthy socialite. Mahi meets Aryan at the wedding. Aryan seems to be apologetic to Mahi, and they decide to rekindle their affair. Aryan says that he wants her to do a big budget film with him, however, the director of the film is reluctant to cast Mahi in the role of the lead heroine as she has lost her appeal. Mahi becomes obsessed with the thought of losing the role to another heroine. She asks Pallavi to leak the sex tape of her and Aryan on the news so that she would get back on the spotlight, for the release of her low budget film. As a result of this controversy, the film becomes an instant hit. Mahi's success and happiness is short lived. She starts questioning her career and life choices. She finally decides to leave the industry after her agent Rashid Bhai quits, and Shagufta Reza (Helen), a veteran actress who Mahi admired dearly, dies. In the concluding scenes, Mahi is shown walking alone in a foreign country, and on being asked if she is Mahi Arora, she replies \"no\". It is implied that she has moved on with her life and put her heroine days behind her. Hooda was cast by the director to essay the role of a cricketer. Prior to the start of principal photography, actor Arunoday Singh was chosen to play the role, but was later dropped from the film due to unknown reasons. Media reports began speculating the name of several actors (such as Ranbir Kapoor, Imran Khan and Prateik Babbar) though Bhandarkar later confirmed that he had selected Hooda after seeing his performance in Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster (2011). As a way to make his character more believable, Hooda began taking tips and lessons from cricketer Virender Sehwag. Raqesh was cast in November 2011 to play \"one of [Kapoor's] lovers\". The director announced that Raqesh Vashisth's character would be kept under wraps along with a few other characters such as that of Goswami's and Dutta's. Along with Goswami, Dutta was also selected to play an important character in the film. Godse was roped in to play the character of Rhea Mehra, a rival heroine who is jealous of Mahi Arora's success. Helen was cast by the director to essay the role of a senior actress. Sharma, who described Bhandarkar as \"a family friend\" was approached by the director to play a glamorous role. In preparation for the role, Sharma was required to lose weight and sign a non-disclosure agreement. Dubey was cast by the director to essay the role of Kapoor's mother. Described as the director's \"lucky mascot\", Shorey was roped in to make a cameo appearance. Following the completion of his film, Jail (2009), Bhandarkar began toying with the idea of making a project on the film industry. Along with writer Niranjan Iyengar, the director began developing the story about the life of an actress and later approached UTV Motion Pictures with whom he had worked on several occasions. Bhandarkar, who was keen on using the title Heroine for his film, donated \u20b9100,000 (US$1,500) to Guddu Dhanoa's charity. He later explained that he had been subconsciously preparing for the movie ever since he joined the industry. Pre-production work on the film was expected to commence during the summer of 2010 but was put on hold due to Kapoor being busy with other commitments. During this period, Bhandarkar announced that he would be making another project while putting Heroine on hold. Though speculated to be based on the lives of yesteryear divas like Madhubala and Marilyn Monroe, Bhandarkar denied the reports saying that the movie is a \"contemporary film which reveals the underbelly of the movie industry and its well-kept secrets\". In an attempt to prepare his protagonist for the film, the director prepared a three-hour documentary on Hollywood actresses Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner and Vivien Leigh. Designer Manish Malhotra was signed on to design the costumes. Choreography of the movie was done by Remo D'Souza Ganesh Acharya and Jasmin Oza. Production for the film was marred by the kidnapping and brutal murder of Meenakshi Thapar by a co-star, Amit Jaiswal, who like Thapar, only had a minor role in the film. Thapar was strangled in her hotel room in Gorakhpur and her body dumped into a water tank and head decapitated and thrown out of the window of a moving bus. The first look of the movie was released as part of the 64th Cannes Film Festival. A promotional poster was released during a press conference in which Ronnie Screwvala of UTV Motion Pictures, Madhur Bhandarkar, and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan officially announced the movie. The director said, \"The movie is a glamorous yet bold story of the internal journey of a superstar. I am certain it will appeal to audiences across the globe and Aishwarya was a perfect choice for the role. In fact, no one could've played it better.\" Screwvala stated \"With Heroine, we plan to take things to the next level. When you watch the film, you will feel that the role was written with someone as talented and stunning as Aishwarya in mind.\" The actress too admitted that she was \"looking forward to this new journey in the movie.\" It was also announced that Aishwarya Rai will be have a wardrobe of more than 40 outfits designed by Manish Malhotra in the film. Explaining why he was launching the project in Cannes, Screwvala alluded to Rai's star power saying, \"She is the brand ambassador for India and for Indian cinema when it comes to the French Riviera.\" The actress was quick to deny any reference to her personal life being portrayed in the movie and said that the entire idea was a result of Bhandarkar's conceptualisation. The Official Press Release distributed as a part of the announcement stated that \"The film is based on the life and times of a superstar heroine, Mahi from the dream factory we call 'Bollywood'. The film is a daring, shocking, glamorous, scandalous behind-the-scenes account of the reality behind the world of glitz and glamour that our film stars inhabit. For a country obsessed with films and film stars, Heroine will take audiences on a voyeuristic journey to see what really goes on in the lives of India's sweethearts.\" The director initially planned to put-forth the theatrical trailer attached to the release of Rowdy Rathore on 1 June 2012. However, there were several matured contents featuring Kareena Kapoor, which were essential and must be there to retain the motive of the film title, as per the director. The Central Board of Film Certification awarded an 'A' certificate to the trailer but chopped off Kapoor's smoking scenes and lovemaking scenes from the trailer. The trailer was then scheduled for a 6 July 2012 release, as it would be releasing alongside Bol Bachchan, although it was then postponed to 20 July 2012. It was once again delayed so it did not clash with the late Rajesh Khanna's chautha. On 22 July 2012, two of the first look posters were revealed on the micro blogging site, Twitter, and received an amazing response in just 8 hours. The trailer was released on 25 July 2012 online and will be released with Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum on 27 July 2012 in theatres. The trailer crossed over a million hits on YouTube within 2 days. The trailer was released on 25 July 2012. After the release of the trailer, a controversy arose. In the film's promo a dialogue of Kareena Kapoor: \"If a heroine buys a car, it's gifted to her by a businessman. If she goes to LA (Los Angeles), she's getting plastic surgery done and, god forbid, if she goes to Dubai, you people make a rate card for her,\" was not appreciated by the people of Dubai. To avoid hurting sentiments, Director Madhur Bhandarkar has had the offending statement censored in the Dubai version. He clarified, \"We have censored it. There are some people who have raised objections. But we did not mean to demean anyone, Dubai is my personal favourite city.\" It was announced that music director duo Salim-Sulaiman, who had earlier worked with Madhur Bhandarkar in his critically acclaimed movie Fashion, will be composing the songs for Heroine. During the shooting of the film, Bhandarkar revealed that there would be two big item numbers in the film, both to be picturised on the leading lady. One of them being called \"Halkat Jawani\". Sung by Sunidhi Chauhan is scheduled as a single track release on 17 August 2012.  Musicperk.com rated the album 7/10 quoting \"Although songs like Halkat Jawani, Khwahishein and Tujhpe fida sound nice and enthusiastic as independent tracks, others probably would need to rely on the picturisation of the song for the required effect to be created\". Heroine received negative reviews from critics upon release while Kareena Kapoor's performance garnered highly positive reviews. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 while saying \"Watch HEROINE for Madhur's imposing direction, for Kareena's superlative performance, watch it also for its fearless, inspiring and enlightening storyline divulging the scandalous realities of the movie industry. Try not to miss it!\". Shomini Sen of Zee News gave it a score of 3 out of 5 and said \"Does Heroine work? Yes, but only because of Kareena Kapoor. From doing the raunchy act in \"Halkat Jawaani\" to the scenes where she is battling depression and popping pills, Kareena makes Mahi memorable and lovable. Heroine is absolutely Kareena's film, not Madhur's. Two for the film and one extra for Bebo. Three cheers for the film!\". Aniruddha Guha of DNA gave Heroine 2 out 5 stars while commenting, \"The characters are all caricatured and the screenplay meanders along aimlessly, it being nothing more than an assemblage of scenes \u2013 each disjointed from the other \u2013 strung together in a long, sleep-inducing and pointless narrative\". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV rated it 2 out of 5 stars, noting \"The film that Bhandarkar has made is indeed disappointingly mechanical. Mercifully, Kareena does demonstrate that she has a feel for the character. But, then, why wouldn't she? After all she plays herself in Heroine\". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN rated the film 2 out of 5 and said \"Despite an entertaining first half, thanks to all the unintentional laughs, Heroine slips into a slush of melodrama post interval. By this point, it feels interminably long and boring\". Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave it 2 out of 5 stars, remarking \"There's nothing innovative about Madhur Bhandarkar's Heroine.I am not sure if this is Bhandakar's idea of comic relief but the hall roared with laughter. What's not funny is just how stunning Kareena Kapoor looks or gives to her role as Mahi Arora\". bRoshni Devi of Koimoi gave the film 1.5 out 5 stars, reviewing \"Heroine irritates more than entertains, but some of the performances are nice. Kareena Kapoor does a good job and, heck, you even get to see her in a pseudo-lesbian scene along with other steamy scenes. If that's enough to drag you to see Heroine, go ahead. Give it a miss otherwise\". The film grossed \u20b96.94 crore (US$1.1\u00a0million) on its opening day. Heroine had an average weekend of \u20b9205 million (US$3.2\u00a0million) nett. The film had collected a fair \u20b9310 million (US$4.8\u00a0million) in its first week. The film had a heavy fall in second week and managed only \u20b960 million (US$930,000) nett. It collected 440\u00a0million.",

        "full_text": " Highway is a 2014 Indian drama film written and directed by Imtiaz Ali and produced by Sajid Nadiadwala. The film stars Randeep Hooda and Alia Bhatt. Screened in the Panorama section of the 2014 Berlin International Film Festival, the film released worldwide on 21 February 2014 The film is based on the episode of the same name from the Zee TV anthology series Rishtey, starring Aditya Srivastava and Kartika Rane, which was also written and directed by Imtiaz Ali. Its tells the story of a girl (Alia Bhatt) who develops Stockholm syndrome after being kidnapped. Upon release the film met with positive reviews , with Alia Bhatt's performance being praised by both audiences and critics alike.   Veera Tripathi (Alia Bhatt) is the daughter of a rich business tycoon. One day before her wedding, she is abducted from a petrol station off a highway, while her fiance - who she did not really love, sits in the car convulsed with fear. The gang who takes her panic when they find out that her father has links in the government. However, Mahabir Bhati (Randeep Hooda), one of the abductors, is willing to do whatever it takes to see this through. The men continuously move Veera through different cities, to avoid being tracked by police. As the days go by, Veera finds peace and a new-found freedom, which confuses and frustrates Mahabir. Veera becomes comfortable with her captors, to the point that she confides in Mahabir the horrors of her childhood, when she was sexually abused by her own uncle as a nine-year-old. She veiws the abduction as a blessing in disguise, since she finally has the chance to experience life and find herself. Eventually, when the police forcefully search the truck, Veera, surprising even herself, hides. She concludes that she loves the journey and doesn't want to go back to her family and old life. Slowly, she unravels Mahabir's story in bits and pieces. His father abused both him when he was a young child, and his mother was used as a sex slave by the rich landlords. Mahabir escaped and has never returned. Mahabir slowly lets down his guard and begins to care for Veera, and his anger fades away slowly. He tries to leave her at a police station in one of the small mountainous towns they stop in. However, Veera refuses and insists on staying with Mahabir. Together, they travel and he starts to fall in love with her. They stay in a hilltop house and Veera reveals that one of her many crazy dreams was always to have a small home in the mountains. Mahabir becomes emotional seeing the way Veera cares for him, reminding him of his mother. Both sleep peacefully that night, free from their respective haunting pasts. But the very next morning, police arrive and, during the chaos, shoot Mahabir, to which Veera reacts emotionally and strongly. She later is brought back to parent's house, where she is surrounded by her family members, including her fianc\u00e9. She finally confronts her uncle who harassed her as a child. She yells and breaks down as she asks her father why he warned her only about dangers posed by outsiders, while the real threat was from insiders, the people who had surrounded her since childhood. She leaves the house and goes to live in the mountains. She gets a job in a factory, buys a house and lives there. The film ends with Veera looking at the mountains, then the sky. Closing her eyes, she sees her nine-year-old self playing happily on the hillside. A boy (Mahabir) joins her. She watches them play, making peace with both the man she loved and their mutual childhood forms. In an interview with The Telegraph, director Imtiaz Ali stated, \"Highway has been a story that has stayed with me for 15 years. There was something in it that didn't die. Usually you lose interest in a story beyond a certain point. But with Highway, there was something very subtle, yet something very influential\". On the story he added, \"Some years ago, I made a half-hour episode for a TV series (1999 for Zee TV's Rishtey starring Aditya Srivastava and Kartika Rane) and that's where I first got a hint for this story. And over time, it changed form and genres until I just gave up. And then it all settled down to this journey of two characters. As for the central female lead, I thought I would cast someone with some experience of life, someone who had probably been through some relationships. While penning the script he stated he had to change many scenes of the film because he felt they were becoming too similar to his previous film, Jab We Met. He said that the film was his first digital film. In the April 2013 interview with the same, he said the film is primarily the story of two characters from very different backgrounds\u2014 played by Randeep Hooda and Alia Bhatt\u2014who take the road trip across six states in a truck. Further, Ali told that he had thought of making Highway in various ways. At an instant he thought of making it a very big action film later he thought of scripting it in a very romantic way; some 12 years back, he drew romantic instances from Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak. He added, \"The film is about the discovery of yourself while traveling. It\u2019s a coming-of-age movie.\" Prior to shooting he didn't complete scripting for the film and the script got ready after the shooting of the scenes because the dialogues were decided on the spot. Over the improvisations in script, he stated, \"For instance, when we were on the top of snow mountains in Himachal Pradesh, I wanted to be open to what nature suggested and the impulses the actors gave me, rather than stick to what I had written, sitting in a room in Mumbai. The film was made on the way, on the go. I had to have very suitable, good actors and a low maintenance crew.\" For Highway, Randeep Hooda prepared for his role with such sincerity that in order to keep the initial distance with Alia Bhatt\u2019s character, he didn\u2019t speak to her for about 25 days. Ali said that earlier he was looking out for an older actress to match up with Hooda. However, the role went to Alia Bhatt that made effect on his film script. Later he added, \"I needed somebody who is city slick girl (Alia Bhatt), who has never been out. But the guy (Randeep Hooda) had to be somebody who has had a life and understanding of life\". About Hooda's character, Ali stated, \"Mahabir is also pure enough not to be a prototypical villain. Only later in the film, certain things are revealed about him, why he\u2019s an oppressor.\" Besides the main casting Imtiaz Ali and Mukesh Chhabra casted Pradeep Nagar as one of the main henchman of Randeep. As per previous collaboration of Ali with the composer A.R. Rahman, the latter's inclusion in the project though initially rumored was confirmed by March 2013. In an interview with The Telegraph Ali stated that he wasn\u2019t even thinking of A.R. Rahman to score for this film. However, after reading the script Rahman agreed to score. In yet another interview Ali stated, he and Rahman were in touch through Skype and Rahman enquired about Ali's new project and wanted to collaborate after Ali deciphered the outline of the story. The film is produced by Sajid Nadiadwala under his new production house Window Seat Films and Imtiaz Ali is the co-producer. The cinematography was done by Anil Mehta. Resul Pookutty was roped in for the film's sound design. Lyricist Irshad Kamil has penned the songs. Principal photography began in early March 2013 on highways of India. Imtiaz Ali quoted, \"Highway is emotionally charged, physically strenuous\". The first look as a snap at the filming location featuring the director and the lead actors was released in March 2013. Initially, the director planned to shoot along Bengal-Bihar-Odisha highway road belt but later opted to shoot along the road highways of Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir, making the film first of its kind to shoot such. Scenes were shot in Kuchaman valley where the sand dunes provided the terrain transitions that were necessarily required. In mid-April 2013, the crew was off to Gurais, Kashmir to shoot a song and some sequences in the valley. Scenes in Aru valley and Chandanwari near Pahalgam in South Kashmir were also canned. By early May 2013, nearly seventy percent of the filming was completed. Although the entire shooting was planned for 60 days the team finished the same in 52 days. On filming scenes, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Ali stated, \"I also didn't go for a large camera setup such as cranes and dollies. I wanted the cameras to be easily transported as we were shooting in difficult locations such as mountains. So if I thought the shot would look better from a higher angle, we could move the equipment faster than if we had a heavy setup.\" Officially, the shooting was wrapped up on 28 May 2013. The film soundtrack album is composed by A. R. Rahman. The album has nine original songs with lyrics of eight tracks penned by Irshad Kamil and remaining one by Lady Kash and Krissy. Initially, the film was planned with only background score and no songs. The track \"Maahi Ve\" sung by A. R. Rahman and \"Patakha Guddi (female)\" sung by Nooran sisters (Jyoti & Sultana Nooran), both these singles framed the score of the theatrical trailer[citation needed] These tracks clenched second position on iTunes India single charts on their respective release dates as singles. The complete soundtrack album had a digital release on 24 January 2014. It debuted on number one position on iTunes India and \"Maahi Ve\" was the chart topping single. Marketing began from November 2013 wherein series of behind the scenes footages as episodes titled under the head \"Highway Diaries\" were released on Bollywood Hungama's production blog. The film's merchandise, consisting head gear, jackets, map scarfs, bags and shirts, all with fabric prints of title logo, were made available for online purchase. On 30 January 2014, Alia Bhatt promoted the film on the sets of Dance India Dance. On 13 February 2014, Hooda, Bhatt, Ali, A. R. Rahman and the director of Disney UTV made an appearance at Cineworld in Feltham to promote the film as well for its first International premiere at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. Ali and Alia Bhatt promoted the film at an event in Taj West End, Bengaluru. The leading duo and Imtiaz Ali appeared on the show Comedy Nights with Kapil to promote the film. Actor Ranbir Kapoor had seen an early cut of the film. He arrived at the Film City studios where he, Imtiaz Ali and Alia Bhatt moved around in the truck and had a talk about the film. This activity of promotion was filmed for the news channel Times Now. Initially set to release on 12 December 2013, the film's release date was moved to 21 February 2014. The trailer of the film was released on 16 December 2013. On 20 February 2014, a day prior to the film's release, the film had a special screening that was attended by Pooja Bhatt, Mahesh Bhatt, Imtiaz Ali, Shazahn Padamsee, Mukesh Bhatt, Bhushan Kumar, and Rekha at the PVR Cinemas in Mumbai. Apart from the guest invitees, critics were specially invited for the film's screening.[citation needed] Metacritic, which uses a normalized rating, gives the film a score of 40 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Critic Srijana Mitra Das for The Times of India gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and stated, \"Highway is not an easy ride. But it offers fresh breezes and new sights.\" For Mumbai Mirror, Rahul Desai wrote, \"Highway makes for the kind of cinema we need, perhaps not something we entirely deserve. Even if you aren't moved by its unhurried simplicity, or do not agree with this review, I challenge you to resist an overwhelming urge to rush out after dark hoping to get kidnapped (or simpler, just take off) to the foothills of the Himalayas. In that itself, is the battle won by a film that strives for little more.\" He gave the film 4 out of 5. Critic Sonia Chopra for Sify gave 4 on 5 and said, \"Maybe there\u2019s no need to intellectualize this beautiful bond and just savour it as it is. Just like the film. Do Not Miss!\" Assigning no rating yet positive critical review, at One India, Venkatesh Prasad stated, \"Highway will be a special experience for you, especially if you like road movies. Film has some valid points about life in general. Watch it and you won't regret your decision.\" Saibal Chatterjee for NDTV gave the film 3 out of 5 and wrote, \"Highway is a must watch as much for what it is as for what it isn\u2019t. It is not a typical romantic drama, nor an average love story. It is a road movie with a difference. Taran Adarsh for Bollywood Hungama assigned the film 2 stars out of 5 and summarized, \"On the whole, Highway is a triumph for Alia Bhatt, who delivers a marvelous performance. Also, what you carry home, besides Alia's winning performance, are the stunning visuals, especially towards the second hour. But the treatment of the written material restricts its appeal largely. The connoisseurs of cinema and a tiny segment of the movie-going audience may go ga-ga over the film, but there's precious little for the large base of mass audience that's looking at the entertainment quotient from the maker of hugely admired entertainers like Jab We Met and Love Aaj Kal.\" Parmita Uniyal for Hindustan Times writes, \"If you are stuck on the crossroads of life, take the Highway.\" The critic described the performance as, \"Alia Bhatt is still a 'student' in Bollywood, but can give a lesson or two to many. A natural performer, she nails it in a couple of scenes\", whereas for Randeep Hooda she wrote, \" He delivers a nuanced yet controlled performance. He perfects the Haryanvi accent to lend authenticity to his character. He's able to get into the skin of his character Mahabir Bhati. His character opens up and frees himself from the self-imposed shackles towards the end.\" For Rediff, Aseem Chhabra after viewing the film in Berlin quoted, \"It is rare that a Hindi language film delivers so much promise in the first half. And so it is extremely disappointing when the director and his script lead us on a journey that eventually fizzles out, collapses and dies in front of our eyes\". He gave the film 2 stars out of 5. According to Movie critic RJ Akki for FireMud FM , \"Alia Bhatt breaks her image from Student of the Year and mesmerises through her role in the movie. Randeep Hooda is expressionless till the interval, but still his acting is commendable. Imtiaz Ali has proved himself all-rounder. To conclude, RJ Akki gave the film 3 stars out of 5. Manohar Basu at Koimoi stated, \"Highway whips up all the ingredients required for an intriguing film but goes wrong as a whole. It is bold subject handled flimsily and doesn't come close to believable. There is excessive heavy handedness in the screenplay and somehow the effortless ease that signifies the beauty of Imtiaz\u2019s films is absolutely missing from it. There is far too much of incoherence in the screenplay to bear and though it tried its hand at adding varied hues to multiple layers of the story, one cannot disagree to the fact that it is only Rahman\u2019s divine music and the pristine cinematography that works here. The film is heart-breakingly mediocre. It is a lenient 2.5/5 for Highway\" Shubhra Gupta for The Indian Express gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, stated that \"Highway is pretty but stagey, Alia Bhatt falters in many places\". Deepanjali Pal for Firstpost writes, \"A journey with Alia Bhatt and many road bumps.\"  According to critic Gayatri Sankar for Zee News, \"Highway emerges as a clear winner. It is not meant for movie goers who enter the theatre hoping to see some bizarre fight sequences, masaledar drama, naach-gaana or intense love-making scenes. Nonetheless, if you are looking forward to seeing a really hatke love story then Highway is your destination.\" She gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5. Priya Joshi of Digital Spy gave it 4 (out of 5) stars: \"It's exemplary filmmaking, and the hope is that audiences will take a detour from the confines of commercial Bollywood and embrace this wholly edifying experience. Highway' will move you in ways you would have never expected.\" Sneha May Francis for Emirates 24/7 wrote, \"Barring a sluggish narrative and a few continuity slip-ups, Imitiaz\u2019s movie promises remarkable performances. Highway is a road less traveled, and one that we think you must embark on. It\u2019s a bumpy ride, no doubt, but one that\u2019s set in the right direction.\" Deborah Young for The Hollywood Reporter stated that \"Soul-lifting visuals and a score by A. R. Rahman help, but can\u2019t save, a pat drama.\" Viji Alles for UKAsian wrote, \"a road-trip movie that not only gives a triumphant two-fingered salute to many films of the genre but to Bollywood convention as well.\" Rachel Saltz for The New York Times putforth, \"Mr. Ali\u2019s story, though, wanders too long and too far, sometimes coming off like a forced mash-up of \u201cIt Happened One Night\u201d and \u201cPatty Hearst.\u201d No wonder the film can\u2019t sustain a tone, wavering between realism and Bollywood hokum.\" Assigning the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, critic Manjusha Radhakrishnan for Gulf News stated, \"It\u2019s gritty in parts and unrealistic in some (which hostage would break out into a hip-hop dance on wasteland). But watch this one for Bhatt and Hooda. They are at their vulnerable, rugged best. Plus, if you are in the mood to see India in its raw, unpolished state, Highway can be an exhilarating ride.\" Critic Zachary Wigon for The Village Voice commented, \"Imtiaz Ali's Highway is nothing if not erratic in its narrative delivery \u2014 though its fascinating thematic concern remains fixed throughout.\" He summarized the film - Indian 1 Percenter Kidnapped! Then She Falls in Love! It's Bollywood..\" Ronnie Scheib for Variety said, \"Life is literally a highway for kidnapper and victim in this engaging and atypical improvised Bollywood road movie.\" At critic Roger Joseph Ebert's website where the film receives 2.5 stars (out of 4) critic-cum-journalist Danny Bowes wrote, \"Highway might be a very good movie indeed. Instead, it's an inconsistent, if intermittently splendorous, work. There are, to be perfectly clear, far worse things in life.\" The released on over 700 screens across India; mostly in multiplexes. It started slowly with occupancy of 20\u201325% at the theatres but later gained momentum during evening in multiplexes in metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Gurgaon, and Bangalore collecting \u20b932.5 million (US$500,000)\u2013\u20b935 million (US$540,000).

Vishwanath asks Megha to quit her job and marry his son, but she refuses when she hears Vijay's strange condition. Vijay wants the marriage to be on a contract basis for a year and, if he does not fall in love with his wife in that duration, the marriage will be annulled. However, Megha's family is in dire financial straits and, so, she has to reconsider this offer. In return for marrying Vijay, she asks for financial support for her family, which Vishwanath readily provides. Vijay and Megha are married. After the marriage, they become friendly with each other, and Megha goes out of her way to look after Vijay when he meets with an accident. At the end of the year, however, Vijay decides to annul the marriage, as had been agreed upon. Megha leaves Vijay and returns home. After the separation, Vijay seems to be enjoying himself; but slowly and eventually, he starts to feel a longing for the presence of his devoted wife. Complications arise when Megha finds out that she is pregnant with Vijay's child. People in her neighbourhood start to question her stay at her mother's house and the identity of the child's father. In order to support herself, Megha gets a job in a new company; to her surprise, when the company's managing director arrives, he turns out to be Vijay. He later confesses to her that he's a changed person and wants her back. But, even after repeated persuasion, she disagrees because her faith in him has been shattered. Vijay continues to pursue her and leaves no stone unturned to show her that he cares for her. Later, Megha and her family hold a ceremony for the well-being of her to-be-born child. Vishwanath and Vijay attend the ceremony as well and give her presents. Megha reveals Vijay to be her husband and tells all the guests about the marriage-contract. An argument follows; Vijay and his father walk out, followed by all the guests. Near the completion of her pregnancy, Megha learns that trouble-makers Khairati Lal and Yeshwant Kumar, who had once attempted to kill Vijay, have escaped from prison. They are out looking for Vijay, who had fired them from his father's company for cheating and fraud. Megha gets anxious and tries to reach Vijay as soon as possible. On the way, she learns that the whole thing was a set-up by Vijay's friends to lure her back to her husband. Enraged, Megha goes to confront Vijay. As soon as she meets him, she accuses him of this shameless act. Vijay then staggers towards her, with his stomach pierced by a piece of glass and blood pouring from the wound. Khairati and Yeshwant have attacked him in reality. Megha runs toward him, slips and goes into labour. Vijay, summoning up all his strength, takes Megha to the hospital. There, he is treated for his injuries and she delivers a healthy baby boy. Megha and Vijay recover and get reconciled.",

        "full_text": " Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (HAHK; English: Who am I to You) is a 1994 Indian musical romantic-comedy film, written and directed by Sooraj R. Barjatya, and produced by Rajshri Productions. Starring Madhuri Dixit and Salman Khan, it celebrates Indian wedding traditions by relating to the story of a married couple and the relationship between their families; a story about sacrificing ones love for ones family. It is an adaptation of the studio's own Bhojpuri film Nadiya Ke Paar (1982). Earning over \u20b91.35 billion (US$21\u00a0million) worldwide, the film became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time. It contributed to a change in the Indian film industry, with new methods of distribution and a turn towards less violent stories. It was the first Hindi film to gross over \u20b91 billion, and when adjusted for inflation, is the highest grossing Hindi film of the 1990s and also still one of the highest-earning Bollywood films ever. Box Office India described it as \"the biggest blockbuster of the modern era.\" The 14-song soundtrack, an unusually large number, is also one of the most popular in Bollywood history, with popular singer Lata Mangeshkar lending her voice for 11 of the 14 songs in the film. Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! won five Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Actress, as well as winning the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. It made a lasting impact on wedding celebrations in India, which often include songs and games from the film.   Prem (Salman Khan) lost his parents at an early age. He lives with his elder brother Rajesh (Mohnish Bahl) and uncle Kailashnath (Alok Nath). Rajesh manages the family business and his family is on the look-out for a suitable bride for him. Professor Siddharth Chaudhary (Anupam Kher) and Mrs. Chaudhary (Reema Lagoo) have two daughters, Pooja (Renuka Shahane) and Nisha (Madhuri Dixit). The Chaudhary couple and Kailashnath are old friends who meet again after several years. They arrange a marriage between Rajesh and Pooja. From their first meeting, Nisha and Prem start bickering lightheartedly with each other, and the fun and mischief continues throughout Pooja and Rajesh's wedding. Prem has an amicable relationship with his warm-hearted sister-in-law. In time, Pooja and Rajesh discover that they are expecting a child. Professor and Mrs. Chaudhary were unable to come to Kailashnath's house for the ceremony marking the impending arrival of the baby. They send Nisha instead, who is present at the birth. Meanwhile, Nisha and Prem fall in love with each other, but keep it a secret. Professor and Mrs. Chaudhary come over to Kailashnath's house to celebrate the birth of their grandchild. When the time comes to part, their hosts are dejected, especially Prem. He and Nisha promise each other that they will soon reunite for ever. Pooja is invited to stay at her parents' house, and Prem takes her there. When they arrive, Pooja learns that Prem and Nisha are in love, and gives Nisha a necklace as a token, promising to get them married. Shortly afterwards, Pooja accidentally slips and falls down the stairs, and dies from a head injury. Everybody is shattered by the tragedy. Nisha takes good care of her sister's son. Hence, her parents and Kailashnath feel that Nisha will be a great mother to the baby. They decide to have Nisha marry Rajesh. Nisha overhears her parents talking about her marrying into Kailashnath's family and thinks that they are discussing her marriage to Prem, to which she agrees. Later, at a pre-nuptial ceremony, she finds out that she is actually going to marry Rajesh. Prem and Nisha vow to sacrifice their love for Rajesh and the baby. Moments before the wedding, Nisha asks Prem's dog Tuffy to give Prem the necklace that Pooja had given her, along with a letter. The letter and necklace fall into the hands of Rajesh. When he realizes that Prem and Nisha love each other, he halts the wedding and confronts both of them. In the end, Nisha and Prem marry each other with the consent of their families. The film's title Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! appears and then rephrases to Hum Aapke Hain..! (English: I am yours!). Director/writer Sooraj Barjatya devoted one year and nine months to the screenplay of Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!. He spent the first five months trying to write another Maine Pyar Kiya, but then started over after his father Rajkumar Barjatya suggested that he rework one of the family company Rajshri Productions earlier offerings. Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! then became a loose adaptation of their 1982 production Nadiya Ke Paar. Barjatya used musical numbers to avoid treating some situations in a cliche manner, which resulted in so many songs that there were complaints during initial screenings of the film concerning its length and number of songs. Barjayta's grandfather, company founder Tarachand Barjatya loved the song \"Dhiktana\" so much that the film was nearly given that title. Barjatya later told India Abroad, \"My attempt in this movie has been to reexpose the cinema-going public to the quintessential family life ... not to make people feel that they have come to see a movie, but make them feel as if they have come to visit a big joint family that is preparing for a wedding\". The story was constructed differently than what was popular at the time. There were no villains, violence, or battles between good and evil. From conception to finished product, the film took four years. Madhuri Dixit was paid a salary of \u20b927,540,000 for playing the role of Nisha. The producers/distributors exercised a higher than normal level of control over their work. There was a limited release, a new form of television publicity, safeguards against video piracy, and a delay in the releasing of video tapes. The film was also dubbed into the Telugu language and released with the title Premalayam. The soundtrack for Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! was composed by Raamlaxman(original name Vijay Patil) who had earlier given music for Rajshri's Maine Pyar Kiya, with lyrics penned by Ravinder Rawal and Dev Kohli. It was produced under the Sa Re Ga Ma label which at that time was known as HMV (short for His Master's Voice) and featured veteran playback singers such as Lata Mangeshkar,S. P. Balasubrahmanyam,Kumar Sanu,Udit Narayan,Shailendra Singh and Sharda Sinha. Raamlaxman had about 50 sessions with the director Barjatya during scripting. The finished soundtrack included an unusually large number of songs at 14 (15 if we count the sad version of the song Mujhse Juda Hokar which appears in the movie but not on the Music Album) , plus the song \"Hasta Hua Noorani Chehra\" (from the film Parasmani), that was used when the characters play a game. The track \"Didi Tera Devar Deewana\" is said to be inspired by Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's song \"Saare Nabian\". That song became one of the most popular film songs ever, and was on the charts for over a year. The soundtrack was very successful upon release, becoming the best selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year, and one of the top four sellers of the 1990s, with 10 million units sold. It is ranked the number 29 all-time best Hindi soundtrack by Planet Bollywood.. The songs of the film were recorded 2 years before its release. It took 3 months to record all the songs. It began in July 1992 and ended in October 1992. It was the last time Lata Mangeshkar sang with S. P. BalaBalasubrahmanyam. It was the last commercially successful Hindi Film album of Raamlaxman. Lata Mangeshkar was skeptical about singing the song \"Joote De Do\" and \"Didi Tera Devar Deewana\". \"Who will listen to these songs\", she said to have asked to which both the director and music director exclaimed, \"If you will sing everybody will listen\". Despite the super success of the album, the music director did not repeat Lata Mangeshkar, S. P. BalaBalasubrahmanyam, Shailendra Singh and Sharda Sinha in his next score with Sooraj Barjatya Hum Saath Saath Hain.[citation needed] The tune of opening lines of the song Mausam Ka Jadoo (Thandi Thandi Purwaiya Mein Udti Hai Chunaria) were copied by Nadeem Shravan in the interlude chorus in the song Jahan Piya Wahan Main (Chandi Ki Katori Sone Ka Pitara) from the movie Pardes. Similarly, part interlude music of the song Didi Tera Devar Deewana were copied by Jatin Lalit in the song Ankhein Khuli Ho Ya Ho Band from Mohabbatein.[citation needed] Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! premiered at Liberty Cinema in southern Mumbai on 5 August 1994; it eventually ran there for over 100 weeks. The film initially saw a very limited release, also showing at the Regal and Eros theatres, with only 26 prints total. Eventually it started to appear in many more theatres. When initial viewers complained about the film's length, 2 of the 14 song sequences were removed. These were later restored when film goers were found to enjoy all of the songs. Early reviewers of Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! predicted that it would be a huge flop; hence the industry was stunned when it went on to become the most successful film of all time up to that point. Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! is one of the biggest grossers ever in the history of Hindi cinema, and is said to have changed film business forever in the country. Made on a budget of around \u20b942.5 million (US$660,000), it went on to collect \u20b91.23 billion (US$19\u00a0million) in India and \u20b91.35 billion (US$21\u00a0million) worldwide. It was the first Hindi film to gross over \u20b91 billion. Adjusted for inflation, the film has grossed over \u20b93.1 billion (US$48\u00a0million) at the domestic box office. Box Office India gave it the verdict \"All Time Blockbuster\", and described it as \"the biggest blockbuster of the modern era.\" Much of the success was due to repeat business. For example, painter M. F. Husain was reported to have seen the film over 60 times. Adjusted for inflation, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun is believed to be among the top five highest grossing Hindi films. Its adjusted gross is approximately \u20b93.09 billion (US$48\u00a0million). Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! received generally positive reviews. India Abroad called it a \"cloyingly familial and touchingly sad melodrama replete with typical Indian social situations\". Redo, an Indian Spitz, received favourable recognition as Tuffy the dog. He was included in the \"Best pets in Hindi films\" list compiled by Daily News and Analysis. After the film, Redo was reportedly adopted by actress Madhuri Dixit. Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. The film was nominated for 12 Filmfare Awards, Including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Actress. The film went on to win five awards making it one of the biggest winners of the year. Lata Mangeshkar, who sang more than 10 songs in the movie, had long retired from accepting awards, but the public demand for the song \"Didi Tera Devar Deewana\" was such that she received the Filmfare Special Award that year. The film also won major awards at the newly introduced 'Screen Awards', where it won six awards. Author Kovid Gupta classified Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! as a film that bridges the gap between traditionalism and modernity. He discussed the songs of the films in particular, and the \"manifestation of romance under the acceptance and blessings of the family, in specific, the elder sister-in-law\". Patricia Uberoi called the film a family film in two ways; it is about family relationships, and it is suitable for the entire family to watch. She said that the film is not about the two leads, but about the family, an ideal family. Tejaswini Ganti has called the film a \"paean to filial duty\" for how the children are willing to sacrifice their love for the good of their families. The family relationships are also noted for being different from the normal cinematic families of the time due to their mutual civility. Rediff.com noted that \"Though the film was initially dismissed as a wedding video, its success indicated that post-liberalisation, Indian audiences still clung to the comfort of the familiar.\" Jigna Desai said that the film's popularity was due to interactions of the families around the traditional folk wedding practices. In his study on the response to the film, academic Vamsee Juluri concluded that the celebration of the family is HAHK's \"most useful contribution to history\". Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! is credited as being a defining moment in Hindi cinema's box office history, and the beginning of a revolution in the Indian film distribution system. When it was released, cinema was in decline in India due to improved cable television, home video, and film piracy. The film was originally released in only a small number of theatres that agreed to upgrade their facilities. Due to widespread demand for the film, many other theatres upgraded in order to get the film. Although ticket prices were raised, the upgraded theatres brought people back who had been lost to television. Also, the film's lack of vulgarity was a sign to middle-class family patrons that they could return to the theatre. This film, in addition to the following year's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, contributed to an increase in Indian cinema attendance of 40% in just two years. The film was so successful that it literally gave the term blockbuster new meaning in India. Box Office India said, \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! [...] took business for films released afterwards to another level. To put into perspective how business changed [...] before Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! an all India share of 10 crore for a big film was regarded as blockbuster business but after Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! the blockbuster business figure went to 20 crore.\"[b] Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! influenced many subsequent Hindi films. The film was also a trendsetter for glamorous family dramas and NRI-related films, and started Bollywood's \"big-fat-wedding-film\" trend. In 1998 a theatre company in London, where the film had played for a year, staged a production based on the film titled Fourteen Songs, Two Weddings and a Funeral. Planet Bollywood has noted that no wedding is complete without some songs from this film, and it has been used as a script to design wedding plans. For years afterwards, women wanted to wear a purple sari like the one worn by Madhuri Dixit in the song \"Didi Tera Devar Deewana\". Filmmaker Karan Johar named it as the one film that changed his life. He said, \"After seeing Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! I realized Indian cinema is about values, tradition, subtlety, romance. There is so much soul in it. [...] I decided to go ahead and be a filmmaker only after watching this film.\" Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! belongs to a small collection of films, including Kismet (1943), Mother India (1957), Mughal-e-Azam (1960) and Sholay (1975), which are repeatedly watched throughout India and are viewed as definitive Hindi films with cultural significance.",

Anupama Chopra said \"this three-hour spectacular is stuffed with songs, romance, comedy, devotional material, and color-soaked dance numbers that are huge even by Hindi standards.\" Michael Dequina writing for TheMovieReport.com said of the three leads \"Rai, in a luminous, award-winning performance (largely considered her big dramatic breakthrough--and justifiably so), fills in the conflicted emotional shades that Khan fails to bring with his one-dimensional presence; and Devgan's soulful subtlety does its job in suggesting Sameer to be a more formidable romantic adversary than viewers would see him as being.\" The reviewer for Filmfare felt it was a \"once in a decade type of extravaganza\" and wrote, \"Cinematographically, the movie is flawless and by virtue of this fact alone, a must-see. It aims at capturing poetry on screen without becoming pretentious. The music by Ismail Darbari is simply enchanting. The film juxtaposes Indian thematic content with exotic foreign locales.\" Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam was a Hit at the Indian box office, becoming the third highest grossing of the Bollywood films of 1999 with \u20b9 200\u00a0million.

        "full_text": " Hum Tum (translation: Me and You) is a 2004 Indian romantic comedy film directed by Kunal Kohli and produced by Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra under their Yash Raj Films banner. The movie stars Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukerji in the lead roles. The film is loosely based on the 1989 romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally.... Hum Tum follows the encounters of the two main characters until they, after several years and various meetings, become friends and finally fall in love at the end of the movie. The comic characters Hum and Tum have their own animated sequences in the movie, where they represent the current state of Karan's and Rhea's relationship. The animation for this film was done by Kathaa Animations and the Special Effects by Tata Elxsi. The director Kunal Kohli has stated that the film \"is inspired from the genre When Harry Met Sally... belongs to.\" The film was generally received well by critics, and special praise went to Khan's and Mukerji's performances. It won several Filmfare Awards, including Best Actress (Mukerji), Director (Kohli), and Actor in a Comic Role (Khan). In June 2005, Khan won the National Film Award for Best Actor.   Karan (Saif Ali Khan) is a cartoonist and a self-styled ladies' man. His daily comic, named \"Hum Tum,\" explores the battle of stereotypical male/female behavior. On a plane from Delhi to New York, he meets Rhea (Rani Mukerji) who doesn't seem to be interested in him. His feeble attempts at flirting go nowhere, but when they have a stop-over in Amsterdam, she agrees to explore the city with him. Karan quickly learns he has little in common with the feisty but proper Rhea, but he won't give up. He ends their contentious time together with an unwelcome kiss. Outraged, Rhea slaps him, and storms off, but Karan insists they'll meet again. After a few months he spots her in a park in New York, and she makes a scene with his girlfriend (Shenaz Treasurywala), who turns out to be Rhea's childhood friend, which ends in their break-up. Three years later, Karan is helping his mother plan a wedding that turns out to be Rhea's. Rhea is marrying Sameer (Abhishek Bachchan). They bicker again, but this time, they part on good terms. Years later in Paris, Karan is visiting his father (Rishi Kapoor), when he runs into Rhea. He learns from Rhea's mother (Kirron Kher) that Sameer has died in a car accident, and he sets out to help her reclaim her positive outlook on life. Karan returns to Mumbai, and three months later, Rhea and her mother visit. Sensing that she needs to be with a strait-laced, \"boring guy,\" he conspires with Rhea's mother to fix her up with his shy best friend, Mihir (Jimmy Shergill). But eventually Mihir falls in love with a friend of Karan's, Diana (Isha Koppikar) and they get engaged. On the engagement night Rhea learns from drunk Diana about the conspiracy, and gets upset with Karan. Mihir makes Rhea realize hers and Karan's love for each other. That night Rhea and Karan consummate their relationship. Karan deems it a mistake and asks Rhea to marry him as he feels he took advantage of her, and that marriage will rectify the mistake. Rhea becomes upset, as she did not consider their actions a mistake; she realizes she loves him but tells Karan that they should not commit one more mistake by marrying for the wrong reasons. Rhea leaves him since Karan projects his confused feelings as guilt rather than as love for her. Karan realises his mistake, and goes out to find her. One year later Karan's cartoon Hum Tum becomes a hit and he writes a book about Hum and Tum. Basically the story is based on his lovestory with Rhea. Rhea reads that book and finds him in the press conference. Karan and Rhea reunite again. Karan admits his love for her, and they get married and have a baby girl. The film had an above average opening and did fairly well at the Box Office, with a net gross of \u20b9305 million (US$4.7\u00a0million) (unadjusted for inflation). It was the seventh highest-grossing film of that year. Critical reception of the film was mixed to positive. The most common form of criticism came from its \"simplistic and at times dragging script\". While critics were divided amongst their opinions about the film itself, the direction by Kunal Kohli and the performances by its lead and supporting casts were adequately praised. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama says that \"casting is one of the film's strengths\", arguing that \"It would be hard to imagine anyone other than Saif as the wisecracking Karan...he makes Karan insufferable and likable at the same time...His arresting performance is sure to sky-rocket his fan-following amongst the youngsters.\" Adarsh also argues that \"Rani's effervescent personality infuses Rhea with buoyancy, and, later in the film, she too shows a vulnerable side. Rani takes a giant leap as an actor...her performance is flawless.\" Music of the film was given by Jatin Lalit and lyrics by Prasoon Joshi. The following are the songs of the film:- The CD and audio cassette also feature an instrumental version of \"Hum Tum\" and a deleted song called \"Yaara Yaara\". This tune was reused in Kunal Kohli's next film, Fanaa, in the songs \"Chand Sifarish\" and, more noticeably, \"Chanda Chamke\". The latter has the same tune throughout the entire song.",

Suhasini Mulay won National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1999 for this movie.   The story opens with the kidnapping of Panna Barve (Tabu), the daughter of Chief Minister Malti Barve (Suhasini Mulay). The responsible gang's demand is that one of their members be released from police custody. While in captivity, Panna reminisces about her childhood, where she had to struggle to grow up with a power hungry and inconsiderate mother and a simple, quiet, and spineless father (Shivaji Satam). Panna's mother had also been carrying on a rather open affair with party co-member Sawantrao Gadre (Mohan Agashe). Flashback over and Panna soon meets the man behind her kidnapping Aditya (Sunil Shetty) who Panna knows from before. Via second flashback, we learn that Panna and \"Adi\" were lovers once upon a time. Their closeness stemmed from the fact that he also was struggling with a corrupt parent in the form of businessman father, P.N. Patel (Kulbhushan Kharbanda). Panna and Adi both find solace in a poor basti with the company of Adi's old teacher Joshi Master and in the philosophy of poet Bhau (Nana Patekar), much to the dismay of the couple's respective parents. Bhau even goes to the extent of becoming Malti's most vociferous opponent. Due to a sudden car accident, however, Adi is presumed dead and Panna loses Adi's out-of-wedlock baby before it can be born. Thus ends the second flashback. Getting back to the kidnapping, Adi and Panna reunite after quite some time. They talk to each other and piece together the events that have occurred since their separation. Just then, the missing gang member is sent back to Adi. It is none other than Bhau, who is returned to the gang with his brain destroyed by electric shock. News also comes that Joshi Master is killed in jail and it is portrayed as a suicide. Panna and Adi then decide what the best form of poetic justice will be for their parents. They both sneak into an election campaign of Malti Bave and P.N. Patel, and explode bombs attached to them, thus destroying everything. The film ends with Panna 's father working as headmaster in a school. Gulzar suggests that although we have already ruined the world for Generation X, we should focus our efforts into the protection and education of our school children. If we shield them from this corruption, they will become the leaders of tomorrow, and they will run the country the way it should be.",

Simran (Sonam Kapoor) loves Bollywood romances so much so that her life has begun to resemble one. With her awesome job and a \"Mr. Perfect\" fianc\u00e9, Raj (Sameer Dattani), she lives a dreamy life. But then comes Jay (Imran Khan), who brings a fresh joy into her life. Jay is an assistant to a director who is famous for his love story films; however, Jay hates love stories. He is a disbeliever of love. He first hates Simran for her obsession with romance, and Simran also has a bad impression of him, but soon after, the two become friends. Simran's close bond with Jay brings problems in her love life. She feels that Raj is not right for her, and falls in love with Jay, dreaming of spending her entire life with him. She decides to confess her feelings to him, but after doing so, Jay explains that he never thought of her that way\u2014they were only best friends. Heartbroken, Simran leaves and does not speak to Jay. Jay finds that her absence in his life upsets him and realizes that he has fallen in love with her. He plans a romantic dinner, asking Simran to meet him. He admits that he loves her but this time, she rejects him, as she does not want to hurt Raj's feelings after giving him another chance. A brokenhearted Jay tries to accept the fact that he has lost Simran to Raj. However, Jay's friends and his mother persuade him to not give up on Simran. Jay tries to make Simran jealous but soon realizes that manipulating her feelings will hurt her even more. Meanwhile, Raj proposes to Simran, and she accepts.

Encouraged, Jay runs back to the premiere. He finds Simran outside the theater and the two express their love for each other and hug, finally getting their happy ending. Among Indian critics, Sukanya Verma of Rediff praised the lead performances and rated the movie 3/5 saying, \"It's Imran and Sonam's collective persona and their free-flowing chemistry that makes all the difference. Although the pair deserve better than an amateurishly written romance to scoop out their terrific potential as a combination\". Gaurav Malani of IndiaTimes rated the movie 2/5 and said, \"If you hate love stories this one's certainly not for you. Which means this ends up being another love story and that too a dull one!\" Nikhat Kazmi of Times of India also praised the lead performances but found the plot predictable and rated the movie 3/5 saying, \"Thematically, I Hate Luv Storys is extremely simplistic, uni-layered and terribly predictable\". Rahul Nanda of Filmfare rated it 2/5 and said, \"The film never equals the sum of all its part, but it's impossible to deny the energy with which it keeps the plot ticking on\". Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave it 3.5/5 saying, \"On the whole, I Hate Luv Storys is a young and vibrant love story with tremendous appeal for the yuppies. The fresh pairing and the on-screen electrifying chemistry, the lilting musical score and the magical moments in the film should attract its target audience\". Parimal M. Rohit of Buzzine Bollywood added, \"I Hate Luv Storys features no shortage of cheesy dialogue, simplistically thematic humor, and unrealistic depictions of lifestyles\" but still has \"some redeeming values (such as) the chemistry between Sonam Kapoor and Imran Khan ... strong individual performances, genuine corniness, and memorable avatars....\" Subhash K. Jha was not impressed, calling it \"a disappointment\". I Hate Luv Storys had a strong opening in multiplexes and a good opening in single screens. It collected 660\u00a0million All-India net and was declared a hit at the box office. Nominated The soundtrack of I Hate Luv Storys is composed by Vishal\u2013Shekhar. The film has 5 original songs followed by 3 remixes. The soundtrack was released on 27 May 2010. It received a favourable review from Parimal M. Rohit of Buzzine Bollywood, with the author saying, \"the soundtrack is phenomenally and breathtakingly romantic. The smooth beats and hypnotic vocals are second to none, and very few soundtracks are as complete as this one\". Ehsaan Noorani of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy trio has provided one of the best guitar arrangements for the soundtrack.",

Instead they meet his widow Krishna, who gives them shelter and tries to seduce them to achieve her own secret goal.

It is a dark satire on the rampant corruption in Indian politics, bureaucracy, news media and business, and stars an ensemble cast including Naseeruddin Shah, Ravi Baswani, Om Puri, Pankaj Kapur, Satish Shah, Satish Kaushik, Bhakti Barve and Neena Gupta. Kundan Shah won the 1984 Indira Gandhi Award for Best First Film of a Director for his work. 'Indiatimes Movies' ranks the film amongst the 'Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films'. The film was part of the NFDC Retrospective at India International Film Festival in 2006.   Professional photographers Vinod Chopra (Naseeruddin Shah) and Sudhir Mishra (Ravi Baswani) open a photo studio in the prestigious Haji Ali area in Mumbai, and hope to make enough money to keep it running. After a disastrous start, they are given some work by the editor of \"Khabardar\", a publication that exposes the scandalous lives of the rich and the famous. They accept it and start working with the editor, Shobha Sen (Bhakti Barve), on a story exposing the dealings between an unscrupulous builder, Tarneja (Pankaj Kapoor), and corrupt Municipal Commissioner D'Mello (Satish Shah). During their investigation, they find out that another builder Ahuja (Om Puri) too is involved in this dealing. While working on their story, Sudhir and Vinod decide to enter a photography contest that carries a prize money of Rs. 5000/-, and take a number of photographs all over the city. On developing their pictures, in one of the photographs they see a man shooting someone. Upon enlarging it, they realize that the killer is none other than Tarneja. They immediately return to the park where they had shot that picture and realize that the body is lying behind the bushes. Before the duo get to the body, it disappears, but they manage to retrieve one of a pair of gold cuff links. Sometime later, they attend the inauguration of a bridge dedicated to the memory of late Municipal Commissioner D'Mello who is supposed to have died of a terminal disease. It is there that they discover the other cuff link. They return at night and dig up that area and unearth a coffin containing the dead body of D'Mello. The duo take a number of photographs of the corpse, and wheel it with them with the hopes of exposing Tarneja. Suddenly the body disappears. Later they find out that the body is with Tarneja's rival, Ahuja who had, in an inebriated condition, carried the coffin tied to his car to his farm house. They provide this information to Shobha, who in turn starts blackmailing Tarneja. He invites her and her associates to crack a deal, and plants a bomb to kill them. Unfortunately, the bomb explodes right in the face of Tarneja and his henchmen, and the trio escape from the scene. Later, the duo realize that Shobha and Ahuja are up to no good, and so they take the corpse, and wheel it with them, but not before Tarneja, Ahuja, the new Municipal Commissioner Srivastav (Deepak Qazir), Shobha and others also get involved, resulting in a series of comic mix-ups including one with some burkha-clad women. The climax is set upon a stage dramatization of the Mahabharata, particularly the enactment of the Draupadi Cheer-Haran episode, which is turned on its head with the duo and the group following them inserting themselves into the scene. The corpse plays Draupadi and the vile Duryodhana, who orders the disrobing in the original version, ends up pledging to save Draupadi's honour at any cost. To make things even more hilarious, a new act - that of the ill-fated romance of Salim and Anarkali - is introduced, with the corpse playing Anarkali. In the end, the police arrives and Vinod and Sudhir present their evidence to the police officer, and it seems as though Tarneja will be arrested. Srivastava, being the Assistant Municipal Commissioner tells the officer to wait a few minutes before arresting Tarneja. Tarneja tells Ahuja and Shobha that if he goes to jail, he would make sure that their malpractices are also exposed. In a twist ending, they all come to an agreement and Srivastava manages to pin the murder of Commissioner D'Mello and the collapse of the bridge on Vinod and Sudhir. In the final scene, Vinod and Sudhir are shown several months/years later released from prison, still in their prison clothes. They turn to the camera and make a cut-throat gesture, signifying the death of justice and truth in an age of corruption. The film had a budget of \u20b9 700,000 (seven lakh rupees). The film was not immediately successful at the box office when released, but was eventually regarded as a cult classic, which is reflected in a recent comment by Indian Express that film's high recall value even after 27 years, is due to \"it(s) superb satirical depiction of the essential, timeless, human condition: supreme self-interest versus some moral/ethical anchor. What made the depiction particularly powerful was its setting: India of the early '80s\". A digitally restored print of the film was released on 2 November 2012 at select theatres. The film opened to an enthusiastic welcome from the media and discerning filmgoers.",

Watch what impact this news has on the marriage, and see what excuses Sunder now comes up with. The music was by Shankar Jaikishan, and interestingly, the whole soundtrack was sung only by Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar. Many of the songs went on to become classics and are still remembered even now, particularly, \"Jiya O Jiya\", \"Teri Zulphon Se Judai\" sung by Mohammad Rafi were big hits and \"Sau Saal Pehle\" by Mohammad Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar.",

        "full_text": " Jab Tak Hai Jaan (English: As Long as I Live, literally \"as long, or as far, as there is life\") is a 2012 Indian romantic drama film directed by Yash Chopra and written and produced by Aditya Chopra under their production banner, Yash Raj Films. The movie is the first collaboration between Khan and Kaif, and the second between Khan and Sharma (they previously featured in the 2008 film Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi). Yash Chopra returned to directing eight years after Veer-Zaara. This was to be his final film before his death in October 2012, at age 80. The background score and soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics from Gulzar. Set in London, England, Jab Tak Hai Jaan tells the story of Akira Rai (Anushka Sharma), an ambitious, hardworking intern at the Discovery Channel. She finds the diary of Samar Anand (Shah Rukh Khan), a bomb-disposal expert. The diary recounts his time as a struggling immigrant in London, and later details his whirlwind romance with Meera Thapar (Katrina Kaif). The film was released during the six-day Diwali weekend beginning on 13 November 2012. Jab Tak Hai Jaan emerged as the third-highest-grossing Bollywood film overseas at that time, after 3 Idiots and My Name Is Khan (2010). The film was praised for its direction, cinematography, and the chemistry between its lead actors. Khan and Sharma were lauded for their performances, though the movie's predictable plot drew criticism. At the end of its theatrical run Jab Tak Hai Jaan received a number of awards, including four Filmfare Awards, which included trophies for Best Supporting Actress (Anushka Sharma) and Best Lyrics for Gulzar.   Samar Anand (Shahrukh Khan), a major in the Indian Army, defuses a bomb in Ladakh without any fear or regard for his safety. He saves Akira Rai (Anushka Sharma), a Discovery Channel filmmaker, after she dives into a freezing river on a dare drowning. Samar gives her his jacket and leaves without taking it back. Akira finds his diary in the pocket and begins reading it. The diary recounts Samar's earlier years as a struggling immigrant in London, working as a busker who also performs other odd jobs to support himself and his roommate Zain. One day, he sees Meera Thapar (Katrina Kaif) outside the church and is smitten by her. He is working part-time as a waiter when he meets Meera again with her fiance Roger at their engagement party. He is disheartened by this. Meera grew up motherless in an affluent Indian family. Her mother (Neetu Singh) left her family for another man (Rishi Kapoor) when Meera was twelve, which left her father (Anupam Kher) as the dominant parental figure. She works for his company. Meera approaches Samar to teach her a Punjabi song for her father's 50th birthday and in return, Samar asks Meera to give him language lessons to improve his English for one month to which they both agree. Samar notices that Meera often prays at church. After a night of wild street dancing, they begin to fall in love. Samar helps Meera face her past, taking her to visit her estranged mother and foster reconciliation. Meera decides to confess to her father about Samar and break her engagement, but when Samar has a motorbike accident, Meera, believing she is the cause of his bad luck, prays to God to save his life, swearing never to see him again. Samar recovers and Meera reveals the vow she made. Angry, he leaves her and London altogether, challenging God to keep him alive as he risks his life everyday. He believes his death is the only way to make Meera lose her faith in God. He goes to India and enlists in the army, becoming a bomb-disposal expert. When Akira finishes the diary in tears, she obtains permission to make a documentary about bomb-disposal squads. She asks Samar for help to make her film and develops a friendship with him and his team. She falls in love with Samar but he does not reciprocate her feelings because of his unresolved passion for Meera. Akira makes a successful film and prepares to leave for London. She wants Samar to come along to help her publicize the documentary. After he reluctantly agrees to come to London, he is struck by a car. Samar is diagnosed with retrograde amnesia, and remembers only the events before his first accident a decade ago back in 2002. Concerned, Akira tracks Meera down and persuades her to help in Samar's recovery. She agrees, pretending that she and Samar are married. In the meantime, Akira realises that Major Samar is only a fragment of the young Samar; he used to be happy and sociable, but is now a bitter and lonely man. One day, Samar finds a bomb planted in the London Underground, and defuses it almost dazedly. The event jogs his memory, and he realises that Meera is lying to him. He confronts Meera at the church where she often prayed ,with a choice: to either be with him honestly, or to see him keep risking his life until he dies. Meera is unable to answer; heartbroken she o went , Samar leaves for Kashmir. During a conversation with Akira, Meera realises that her beliefs and prayers subjected Samar to a fate worse than death; realising her mistake, she goes to Kashmir. At the same time Akira shares her story about Samar in London as he defuses his last bomb, and then proposes to Meera. In June 2011, Yash Raj Films released a statement announcing a new directorial venture by Yash Chopra coinciding with the 50th anniversary of his Bollywood career. The producers also announced that the film would be released during the Diwali[a] 2012 weekend. Chopra said the film was untitled at that time, similar to previous project Veer-Zaara (which was named on the day of its submission to the Central Board of Film Certification). The producers considered a number of titles but were not satisfied with any of them. In September 2012, it was announced that the title of the film was Jab Tak Hai Jaan. It was inspired by a similarly titled song from the 1975 film, Sholay. Aditya Chopra wanted his father, Yash Chopra, to make another film and approached him with the concept for Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Shah Rukh Khan was their first choice for the role of Samar Anand, due to his long-standing relationship with the production house and the Chopra family. Khan, who was working on other projects at that time, was unavailable for the shooting schedule so it was changed. As in his previous productions, Yash Chopra wanted to introduce a fresh pairing in Jab Tak Hai Jaan and chose Katrina Kaif to star with Khan. Anushka Sharma was cast in a supporting role to complete her three-film contract with Yash Raj Films, with whom she had worked on many previous projects. Though casting was quickly completed, shooting was delayed because the lead actors were busy with other projects. Khan's role spans two ages: one (age 28) as a London-based street musician and the other (ten years later) as an introverted, composed and dutiful army officer in Kashmir. In an interview, Khan revealed details about his character: Samar is \"angry, unforgiving, with loads of emotional baggage. I play him sweet when he needs to be. Actually, he is a lot like I am. Samar is a combination of angst, tenderness, anger, and yeah, he\u2019s pretty unforgiving.\" Kaif's role was described as \"the archetypal Yash Chopra seductress, an unattainable beauty\". She worked hard to make her character believable (with help from Khan, who had previous experience with the director). Sharma's character, Akira, was described as a \"21-year-old who works for the Discovery Channel and makes documentaries. She is on a quest to discover the truth behind the story of The Man Who Cannot Die (Samar Anand) in the film. She is extremely ambitious and will do anything to make it big and realize her dreams.\" The film's principal photography was expected to begin in November 2011 but was delayed because Khan wanted to take a break after his two previous films, Ra.One and Don 2. Principal photography began on 9 January 2012 at Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai, where a significant part of was shot. After filming in India, the crew began a 35-day shooting schedule in London on 22 February 2012. It was shot under the working title Production 45. Khan arrived in London on 21 February 2012, and finished filming on 26 March 2012. During the filming, photos of the actors on-set were leaked on the Internet, triggering a camera ban by the producers and increased security. A number of locations throughout the city featured in Jab Tak Hai Jaan, including the Borough Market, Jubilee Walkway, the Great Conservatory, the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Bridge, Trafalgar Square, the Hungerford Bridge and Golden Jubilee Bridges, the O2 Arena, the Tower Bridge, and Canary Wharf. A dance sequence was filmed next to King's College London law school in Somerset House. A car-crash scene was filmed at Shepherd's Bush by closing four streets in the area. Filming was completed on 27 March 2012 at an indoor location in East London. The romantic scenes were directed by Chopra's son, Aditya, to give them a more contemporary feel. The \"Ishq Shava\" dance scene was shot with the leading duo and freestyle dancers in an underground club and aboard a boat on the River Thames. The film's climax, initially planned by Chopra to be shot in the mountains of Kashmir, was moved to Ladakh. This was reportedly suggested by Khan, whose Dil Se.. was shot in the area many years earlier. Portions of Jab Tak Hai Jaan were filmed in three Kashmiri cities: Srinagar, Pahalgam, and Gulmarg. Yash Chopra wanted to add scenes from the Swiss Alps to the title song; however, the scheduled shoot was cancelled after his death. Aditya Chopra wanted to keep the film as it was because he felt that doing otherwise would \"tamper\" with his father's vision. The music for the film was composed by A. R. Rahman, who teamed up with Yash Chopra for the first time. He signed to compose the soundtrack in May 2011. The first song of the soundtrack was completed in December 2011. By February 2012, Rahman said in an interview with The Times of India that he had completed three songs for the film. He summarized the soundtrack album: \"It's a combination. They wanted to do my kind of songs at the same time they wanted the old charm and soul of music that Indian audience would love and which I wanted to do for a long time.\" The soundtrack features nine songs, with eight lyrics by Gulzar and the title track written by Aditya Chopra. It was released by YRF Music on 9 October 2012. Jab Tak Hai Jaan was released on 600 screens in overseas markets; the estimated number of release screens in India was about 2,500. Yash Raj Films distributed the film to 1,000 multiplexes and 1,500 single-screen cinemas. Jab Tak Hai Jaan was selected for the Doha Tribeca Film Festival and the Marrakech International Film Festival. It was chosen to \"honour the legacy\" of Yash Chopra, since it was his last project. Two weeks before Jab Tak Hai Jaan's release, Ajay Devgn sent a notice to the Competition Commission of India accusing Yash Raj Films of monopolistic business practices; the notice contended that they used \"their dominant position in the Bollywood film market\" to secure many desirable single-screen theatres for their release. Yash Raj Films responded by saying that they were \"shocked\" and questioned Devgn's \"motives\". The studio denied Devgn's claim that high-quality single-screens were unavailable, pointing out that they had only booked 1,500 single-screens for Jab Tak Hai Jaan out of the 10,500 available in India. After the rebuttal by Yash Raj Films, Devgn said he only managed to book 600 single-screens for Son of Sardaar and would take legal action if not allotted more. He accused Yash Raj Films of signing tie-in agreements for Ek Tha Tiger with exhibitors, requiring them to show Jab Tak Hai Jaan on Diwali and keep it in cinemas for at least two weeks thereafter. A week before the release of Jab Tak Hai Jaan and Son of Sardaar, the commission dismissed Devgn's claim. In an interview a commission spokesperson said: \"We considered the plea application. We have not found any merit in the case as there is no case of abuse of dominant position. There is no violation.\" After his notice was rejected, Devgn appealed the decision; the Appellate Tribunal refused Devgn's request to nullify agreements made with single-screen exhibitors for the release of Jab Tak Hai Jaan, but agreed to reexamine the case to determine if Yash Raj Films had engaged in monopolistic practices. Both films were released on 13 November 2012 in the number of single-screens originally contracted. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 4 (out of 5) stars, saying that it was \"attention-grabbing from inception till conclusion. The drama only soars higher and the complex love story gets more and more gripping as the conflict between the characters come to the fore.\" Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave it 4 (out of 5) stars: \"At a gracious 3 hours runtime, JTHJ feels like an epic love story. And it is just that. JTHJ is the perfect adieu to a hallmark career. It is the best romantic film made in this generation.\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave it 3.5 (out of 5) stars: \"Despite the lovey-dovey nothingness that drives the plot, Jab Tak Hai Jaan has more substance than most romantic films that come out of Bollywood.\" Meena Iyer of The Times of India rated it 3.5 (out of 5) stars, saying: \"Every frame is picture-perfect, the emotions are well nuanced. But there is one inherent flaw\u00a0\u2013 the story by Aditya Chopra is hackneyed.\" Subhash Jha (also from The Times of India) said, \"Jab Tak Hai Jaan makes you fall in love with love all over again.\" Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: \"Jab Tak Hai Jaan is too tangled to transport you. But I recommend that you see it. Because only Yash Chopra could make heartache so attractive and ennobling that his characters wear it like a badge of honor.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: \"I'm going with three out of five for the late Yash Chopra's Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Despite its many script problems, it's a consistently watchable film that oozes with feeling and real emotion. A fitting swan song.\" OPEN magazine gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars, praising Yash Chopra's direction. Ajit Duara called it \"a deeply-felt cinematic perspective from 80 years of living.\" Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, saying: \"As a swan-song for the master director, Jab Tak Hai Jaan might only be a middling effort. But then, sometimes, all we need is a Khan-song.\" Shabana Ansari of Daily News and Analysis gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: \"If you must, watch Jab Tak Hai Jaan for Shah Rukh, who can still convey love and passion in a fleeting look or a dimpled smile; and for Yash Chopra who gave us some of the most enduring romances of all times.\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film 2.5 (out of 5) stars, saying \"watch this one for Shah Rukh, who can still do the dimpled boy wonder and the older, mature lover with a wry smile and wounded wink and sexy nudge.\" Sukanya Verma (also from Rediff.com) described it as an \"elegant, harmless entertainer for [the] most part\", praising the visuals, acting and music. She criticised the screenplay, contending that the film could have been \"snappier\", and gave it 2.5 (out of 5) stars. Piyasree Dasgupta of First Post wrote: \"You have seen everything Jab Tak Hai Jaan has many times before, just in other films. And probably with far better music than A.R. Rahman threw into this one.\" Jab Tak Hai Jaan received positive reviews from critics overseas. Priya Joshi of the website Digital Spy gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: \"The film is invested with a healthy dose of Shah Rukh, the very heart and saans of Yash Chopra and the message which he lived and breathed through his films: that love is eternal.\" Simon Foster of Australia's Special Broadcasting Service also gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, calling it \"a grand cinematic work boasting all the pros and cons of the genre.\" He observed: \"Chopra fans will not hear complaints that the great producer-director had become mired in a rut, or that his films are rote melodramas reliant on boisterous music (here, a typically string-heavy work from the omnipresent A.R. Rahman) and over-active camerawork. One could argue that it's their very vivid cinematic nature that makes them particularly noteworthy, even when the dialogue (at times, awful) and plotting (rarely based in logical realism) can test one's patience.\" Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times wrote: \"The film has a freshness that would never lead one to think it was directed by an 80-year-old while at the same time it has a sureness of tone, a certainty about itself even at its most audacious, that only comes from the hand of a seasoned master...Jab Tak Hai Jaan serves as a fitting tribute to the career of Chopra.\" Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"Director-producer Yash Chopra's film, his final project before he died, delivers not only the romance and human touch, but also reflects a modern sensibility.\" Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote, \"Even though the film drags, the magic of Bollywood is that this story's muddle of twists only clarifies the urgency behind the undying desires of all concerned parties.\" Mazhar Farooqui of Dubai's the Gulf News wrote: \"Despite its inherent flaws, JTHJ comes across as a beguiling romantic film that takes you on a roller coaster ride of high emotions set amidst picture postcard locales but more than anyone the movie belongs to Chopra. In his swan song, the celebrated director once again proved why his legacy will be hard to match.\" Jab Tak Hai Jaan received a number of nominations and awards at Bollywood award shows. The film has been praised for its direction, cinematography and chemistry between the lead actors, with Shahrukh Khan and Anushka Sharma receiving accolades for their performances; however, its script and predictable plot have been criticised. The film won four Filmfare Awards, five Zee Cine Awards and two Colors Screen Awards. Jab Tak Hai Jaan received several marketing and business awards for its overseas performance, promotions, distribution, and music. However, Sharma and Kaif were nominated for Golden Kela and Ghanta awards; some critics felt that their acting was less than stellar. Anushka Sharma and Shreya Ghoshal were the main recipients who were given awards. Jab Tak Hai Jaan grossed \u20b92.11 billion (US$33\u00a0million) worldwide.

        "full_text": " Jab We Met (English: When We Met) is a 2007 Indian romantic drama film directed and written by Imtiaz Ali. The film, produced by Dhillin Mehta under Shree Ashtavinayak Cinevision Ltd, stars Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor in their fourth film together with Dara Singh, Pavan Malhotra and Saumya Tandon in supporting roles. The film tells the story of a feisty Punjabi girl who is sent off track when she bumps into a depressed Mumbai businessman on an overnight train to Delhi. While attempting to get him back on board when he alights at a station stop, both are left stranded in the middle of nowhere. Having walked out of his corporate business after being dumped by his girlfriend, the man has no destination in mind, until the girl forces him to accompany her back home and then on to elope with her secret boyfriend. Released in the United Kingdom a day before its worldwide release of 26 October 2007, the film became a hit at the Indian box office as well as overseas. The distributors of the film, Shree Ashtavinayak Cinevision Ltd, announced that Jab We Met would be remade by corporate entity Moser Baer in four other Indian languages: Tamil (dubbed into Telugu), Kannada and Malayalam. The film remains one of the most romantic movies in Bollywood. The movie catapulted to one of the best success stories throughout the bollywood cinema.   Aditya Kashyap (Shahid Kapoor), a wealthy industrialist faces many problems in business and personal life. He seems really depressed and is going through a lot in his life . After attending his girlfriend's wedding with someone else, he leaves his mobile, car and identities behind and walks away. At chatrapathi shivaji terminal he boards a departing train. He is not even aware where the train is headed to and just boards it. It is there where he bumps into Geet Dhillon (Kareena Kapoor), an energetic, talkative Punjabi girl. He is so lost in his thoughts that he tries to jump off of the train but Geet reaches there on time and stops Aditya from doing so.He finds her irritating and shouts and eventually ends up offending her a little but she continues her chatter after he apologizes. Aditya gets off the train and Geet follows him making her miss the train. Aditya reluctantly agrees to help Geet by driving a taxi at a stupendously fast speed to the next train station where the train Geet was in was to stop next. However, Geet misses the train again and Geet and Aditya rent a room but is later raided by the police. Aditya starts to feel good about life again and starts to have fun with Geet and also takes him to her home in Bhatinda where her Punjabi family is very thankful to Aditya. When Geet's grandfather( Dara Singh) sees them both together, he thinks that they are a couple and that they are in love with each other. But no one seems to believe him. Aditya has fallen in love with Geet but is aware that Geet does not love him and instead loves Anshuman (Tarun Arora). Geet decides to elopes with Anshuman as she was sure that her family wouldn't agree for their marriage as their religions are different. When she escapes from her house along with Aditya, her family thinks that they both eloped. They go to Manali, where Anshuman resides. Geet requests Aditya to come with her and meet Anshuman, but he says that their journey together is over and bids her farewell, and the two part ways. Nine months later, Aditya's company announces the name of a new caller card as Geet on television which Geet's family see. When Geet's uncle (Pavan Malhotra) angrily meets Aditya he says Geet is not with him but somehow knows that she is fine but actually he does not know Geet's condition as he thought Geet would be with Anshuman. He goes to meet Anshuman and discovers that Anshuman had rejected Geet. Aditya then goes to Manali where he is shocked to see Geet as a depressed and quiet schoolteacher, having lost her bubbly and energetic character. He brings her back home to Bhatinda to her relatives as promised to her uncle. He takes Anshuman there too as his friend. Geet's grandfather again says that they are a couple which is true as Aditya and Geet love each other but Geet thinks she loves Anshuman. All the rituals are performed with Aditya when they should be done with Anshuman but the family does not know about Anshuman. Aditya chooses to leave as he still thinks Geet loves Anshuman. After Aditya leaves the field where he, Geet and Anshuman were, Anshuman tells Geet that she needs to tell her family that she loves Anshuman. Upon hearing this, Geet realises that she was unable to tell her mother about Anshuman despite having an opportunity and cannot do so because she realises that she loves Aditya. She runs away from the field only to find Aditya with a kid of her family and kisses him showing that she has finally admitted that she loves Aditya. They get married and have twin daughters. Pre-production work on the film began in early 2007 when Shree Ashtavinayak Cinevision Ltd announced that director Imtiaz Ali would be directing the then real life couple Shahid and Kareena Kapoor in their first \"full-fledged romantic drama\". When Ali began casting for the film, Kareena Kapoor was the director's first choice to portray the role of Geet Dhillon whilst actor Bobby Deol was the first choice for the role of Aditya Kashyap but afterwards Shahid replaced Bobby and was cast as hero after Ali(director) met him and discovered the actor was more than a poster boy. On the two lead actors, Ali commented, \"I wanted a girl who could look natural in scenes where she misses the train. She had to be without make-up, someone who could be hyper, talkative and interesting but not irritating. I was never a fan of her [Kareena] and hadn't seen too many of her flicks, but I just knew Kareena was perfect as Geet [...] [On the other hand], When I met him [Shahid], I realised he wasn't the forgettable actor that he comes across in several of his movies. He has gone through a lot in life and that maturity had never been brought out. He was perfect for the role of a young, mature, quiet guy.\" The film was shot throughout the Punjab region, and started on 20 March 2007 in Chandigarh and later headed to Shimla and Manali, where the crew filmed a song on the Himalayas and the Rohtang Pass. Manish Malhotra served as the costume designer during the filming. The summer shots in Punjab of the haveli were shot in Nabha near Patiala. While shooting the last schedule of the film in Mumbai, sources had indicated that the lead pair had broken up. Though the media projected it as a publicity stunt for the film, it was later confirmed that the couple had indeed broken up. The title of the film was decided by a popular vote; moviegoers had a choice between Punjab Mail, Ishq Via Bhatinda ('Love via Bhatinda') and Jab We Met. To promote the film, the actors appeared separately on different television shows. Kareena Kapoor appeared as guest judge on the singing talent contest Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2007 whilst Shahid Kapoor appeared on Amul STAR Voice of India and Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa respectively; they later appeared together on the television show Nach Baliye. Apart from this, the producers also painted two full local trains in Mumbai from the Western and Central lines with Jab We Met imagery, where Shahid Kapoor chatted up with fellow passengers and informed them about the movie. On the night of 23 October 2007, a special preview of the film was organized at Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai for those associated with the film and their families. The film opened to positive reviews on 26 October 2007 with a fairly good opening of 70% all over India and later increased to 90% during the weekend. Making a total first week net business of 11.75 crores from 350 cinemas, the film went into the second week with very strong collections and saw a massive increase with 40%-50% increment in shows worldwide. Continuing its strong march in week two with collections of over \u20b990 million (US$1.4\u00a0million) and a two-week total of \u20b9210 million (US$3.2\u00a0million), the film was declared a hit. During its third week, Jab We Met managed to add another \u20b920 million (US$310,000) to its collections but suffered a setback due to the arrival of Farah Khan's Om Shanti Om and Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Saawariya, which resulted in the number of shows for the film being reduced. Due to popular demand and the poor performance of the latter, the following week saw an increase in the number of prints for the film across the country, and resulted in a 50% increase of the film's collections. Completing fifty successful days at the box office on 14 December 2007, the film received a hit status by BoxOffice India and continued running successfully in cinemas with greater number of shows than the much later-released, Om Shanti Om. As of February 2008, Jab We Met has made a net business of over \u20b9300 million (US$4.6\u00a0million), and has emerged as one of the biggest hits of the year. On 30 January 2008, it was announced that to celebrate the success of its 100 days run at the box office, PVR Cinemas in Delhi would have a special screening of the film on Valentine's Day. Meanwhile, Jab We Met also opened well overseas especially in the U.K., where it was released a day before its worldwide release of 26 October. Debuting at number 10 in the U.K., the film grossed \u00a311,488 on its previews night and \u00a3144,525 on its opening weekend, collecting a total of \u00a3156,013 from 31 screens. The film continued to do strong business and garnered excellent collections during its second week, making a two-week total of \u00a3325,996. Over the next five weeks, Jab We Met collected a total of \u00a343,529 from 54 screens and made a grand total of \u00a3424,681. Upon release, the film opened to positive reviews. Critics praised the film for its simplicity, its romance, saying that it was \"one of the finest romantic films to come out of Bollywood in 2007\". The film's direction and performances were particularly appreciated. Taran Adarsh from indiaFM gave the film a 3.5 out of 5 rating saying it is \"as refreshing as an ice-cold watermelon juice in scorching heat.\" Subhash K. Jha wrote, \"...Jab We Met is the kind of cinematic experience that is hard to come by in this day and age of smoky cynicism and borrowed rage.\" Rajeev Masand from CNN-IBN, who gave the film 3 stars out of 5, described it as \"a film bursting with the kind of lovely little moments that'll bring a smile to your face. Khaled Mohamed, of the Hindustan Times, gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying the film, \"is quite a delight, particularly for the chirpy-chirpy-cheep-cheep girl and the retentive, moan-groan boy. Directed with a flair for garnishing even the most abject of circumstances with humour and irony, here\u2019s a feel-cool movie. Wonderful. Most critics agreed that the main highlight of the film was the leading pair and Shahid and Kareena's chemistry. Rajeev Masand further explained, \"The real magic of this film lies in the performances of its two main leads who seize your attention from the moment they first appear on screen.\" Taran Adarsh commented, \"Shahid delivers his career-best performance in Jab We Met... Kareena is in top form as well. Jab We Met is a turning point in her career [personally as well as professionally]. Fantabulous -- that's the right word to describe her work this time. The confidence with which she handles the contrasting characterization speaks volumes. This film should do for her what Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) did for Kajol.\" Subhash K. Jha approved the chemistry as well, \"...there are sparks...and the ones between Kareena and Shahid are so unselfconsciously genuine that you end up looking at the characters rather than the two actors going through a series of brilliantly conceived and energized incidents...\" The Times of India gave the film 4 out of 5 stars concluding, \"The film belongs to Shahid and Kareena who pitch in memorable performances and lend a whole new meaning to the boy-meets-girl story.\" Joginder Tuteja from indiaglitz.com gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, described it as \"Shahid-Kareena's DDLJ\", and concluded that \"...it would be a pain if any of the two actors do not get awarded and rewarded for their performances...\" Reviews were favourably directed towards the director, Imtiaz Ali, as well. Indiatimes wrote, \"After his much appreciated Socha Na Tha (2004), Imtiaz goes bigger and better and the result is nothing but flying colours\" Jab We Met remains one of the most popular romantic films in Bollywood. The film helped bring Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor's acting careers to a whole new level. The couple was named onto Bollywood Hungama's list of the top 10 best romantic couples of the decade. Yahoo! Movies India listed the film as one of the Bollywood's top 10 most romantic movies. The film's plot inspired the television show Love U Zindagi.

Her character, Geet Dhillon, has become one of the most popular and recognizable heroines in Bollywood. She later went on to say about her role, \"To play a character like 'Geet' doesn't happen all the time; it just happens. When you begin working on a film, you of course know about the story and your character. However, no one knows how audiences would eventually react to it. 'Geet' did strike a chord with the audiences and became a household name.\" Kareena Kapoor, for her performance, was ranked at number 66 in Filmfare magazine's 80 Iconic Bollywood Performances list. According to Hindi Film News, she was number 5 in the critic's top ten and number 4 in the popular top ten for the finest performance by a Bollywood actress for the decade.

Metro and turns out to be most satisfying experience, it is Jab We Met. The album is a perfect example of how to get a quality soundtrack which mixes songs for different segments of audience.\" Movietalkies.com rated the album 4 out of 5 stars, describing the album as \"certainly one of the better albums that have come out this year ...

At the boarding school, Ajay continues his ways and gets into trouble all the time, including with Shekhar. Meanwhile, Ajay meets and befriends a crippled boy named Shakti (Rattan Kumar) whose character is the opposite of Ajay. Shakti tries very hard to help Ajay change his ways, but Ajay's stubborn nature gets in the way. Finally one day, Ajay attempts to leave the hostel and Shakti finds out. Shakti tries to go after him and stop him but his handicap slows him down and his earnestness to get Ajay back causes him to lose track of the heavy traffic on the road. That is when Shakti is run over in a horrific accident. This was the triggering moment in Ajay, realizing that it was because of his stubbornness, Shakti died. This moves him to change and become a better person. He goes on to excel in academics and sports. Meanwhile, Shekhar's method of teaching wins approval by the education board in the end.

The film centers on the trials of a poor villager (Kapoor) who comes to a city in search of a better life. However, the naive man soon becomes trapped in a web of middle-class greed and corruption. The film also features a cameo by Nargis in the final scene. It was produced in Bengali as Ek Din Raatre, starring Raj Kapoor, Chhabi Biswas, Pahari Sanyal, Nargis Dutt, Daisy Irani.   A poor peasant (Kapoor) from the village, who comes to the city in search of work, is looking for some water to quench his thirst. He unwittingly enters an apartment building, whose residents take him for a thief and chase him. He runs from one flat to the other trying to escape his predicament. Along the way, he witnesses many shady undertakings in the flats where he hides. Ironically, these crimes are being committed by the so-called \"respectable\" citizens of the city, who by day, lead a life totally in contrast to their nighttime deeds behind closed doors. He is shocked by these events, and tries to escape by evading the search parties, that are patrolling the apartment building in search of the elusive thief. He is unfortunately seen, and people chase him to the roof of the building. He puts up a brave resistance, and then descends by the water pipes onto the porch of a flat. He goes in to find a young girl (Daisy Irani). She talks to him and kindles a self belief in the peasant, who determinedly tries to face the adversity waiting outside. But when he ventures out of the flat, he is surprised to find that nobody takes notice of him. He eventually leaves the apartment building, his thirst still unquenched. He hears a beautiful song and searching for its source arrives at the doorstep of a woman (Nargis) drawing water from a well. His thirst is finally assuaged. Other than the acting, the music is the highlight of the film. Lyrics are by Shailendra and Prem Dhawan and music is by Salil Choudhary. The songs are 1. \"Zindagi Khawab Hai, Khvaab Me Jhuth Kya Aur Bhala Sach Hai Kya\" - Mukesh 2. \"Main Koi Jhoot Boleya\" sung by Mohammed Rafi and S. Balbir and 3. \"Jaago Mohan Pyaare\" - Lata Mangeshkar 4. \"Aiven Duniya Deve Duhayi, Teki Main Jhuth Bolaya, Koi Na\" - Mohammed Rafi, Balbir 5. \"Jab Ujiyara Chhaye, Mann Kaa Andhera Jaye\" - Lata Mangeshkar 6. \"Thandee Thandee Savan Kee Phuhar\" - Asha Bhosle 7. \"Maine Jo Li Angdayi\" - Haridhan, Sandhya Mukherjee The song 'Zindagi khwab hai', picturized on Motilal in Hindi was recorded as 'Ei Duniaye shobi hoi' in the Bengali version and was picturized on Chhabi Biswas. Most of the story line is identical between the two versions, as were the songs; 'Teki main jhuth boliya', sung by Mohammed Rafi and picturized on Sikh drivers is consistent in both versions. Jago Mohan Pritam sung by Lata Mangeshkar is common to both versions - only the lyrics were changed to Hindi and Bengali, as applicable. A shortened version of the film won the Crystal Globe Grand Prix at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in Czechoslovakia in 1957. At the fourth annual National Film Awards, the film won the Certificate of Merit.",

Barot also received the Filmfare Best Sound Award for this film. Tanuja received a Filmfare nomination as Best Supporting Actress.   Vinay (Dev Anand), is an ordinary young man who finds himself constantly mistaken for a look-alike jewel thief named Amar. Vinay works with the police to impersonate Amar and crack his crime ring, but it seems that Amar has decided to impersonate Vinay, as well, and soon their true identities are thoroughly muddled. Vinay lives with his father, a Police Commissioner, and his mother in Bombay. Vinay's dad is quite upset with him as he has not learnt any skills, and spends all his time examining stones and jewellery. The city is being held at ransom by a daring jewel thief, who continues to baffle them to no end. They do get a pleasant surprise when they find out that he has secured employment with a leading jeweller by the name of Vishamber Nath. Vinay also gets to meet Nath's attractive daughter, Anju, and there is romance budding in the air. This is short lived when several people greet Vinay as \"Amar\" or \"Prince Amar\". Things come to a boil when a young woman named Shalini comes forward and claims that Vinay is her fianc\u00e9. Vinay is able to prove to them that he is indeed Vinay, and co-operates with them to locate this elusive Amar \u2013 only to find himself embroiled in a devious scheme \u2013 that robs him of his sanity, makes him lose his memory, identity, and makes him a target of every policeman in India, particularly in the then-independent Kingdom of Sikkim. For the lead female role, Saira Banu was approached by Dev Anand. Banu, who had earlier worked with Anand in Pyar Mohabbat (1966) declined the role due to her marriage to actor Dilip Kumar. Banu had also turned down the role of Rosie in the 1965 film Guide which was produced by Anand in 1965. Soon, actress Vyjayanthimala was signed for the role; she had worked with Anand before in Amar Deep a decade earlier. Vyjayanthimala was also considered by Anand for the lead role in Guide but was rejected by Tad Danielewski, the director of Guide's English version. The film's soundtrack was composed by S. D. Burman, who earlier made a string of memorable film under the Navketan Films.The lyrics for this film were by Majrooh Sultanpuri except for \"Rula kay gaya sapna\" by Shailendra. At that time Shailendra saab wasn't keeping well so Majrooh saab was approached for the movie. The male playback was done by Kishore Kumar and Mohammed Rafi who lent their voice for Dev Anand. The female singers were Lata Mangeshkar who lent her voice for Vyjayanthimala and Asha Bhosle for Tanuja and Helen. The song Raat Akeli Hai picturised on Dev Anand and Tanuja, was used in 2011 Bollywood horror film Ragini MMS by Ekta Kapoor. The music for all the songs were composed by S. D. Burman and The lyrics for this film were by Majrooh Sultanpuri except for \"Rula Ke Gaya Sapna\" by Shailendra. Jewel Thief was a profitable venture for the distributors.

        "full_text": " Jodhaa Akbar is a 2008 Indian historical romance film co written, produced and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. It stars Hrithik Roshan, Aishwarya Rai and Sonu Sood in the lead roles. The shooting for the film started at Karjat and released on 15 February 2008. The film centres on the romance between the Mughal Emperor Akbar, played by Hrithik Roshan, and the Princess Mariam-uz-Zamani who becomes his wife, played by Aishwarya Rai. Acclaimed composer A. R. Rahman composed the musical score. The soundtrack of the movie was released on 19 January 2008. The film won the Audience Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the S\u00e3o Paulo International Film Festival, two awards at the Golden Minbar International Film Festival, seven Star Screen Awards and five Filmfare Awards, in addition to two nominations at the 3rd Asian Film Awards.   Jodhaa Akbar is a sixteenth century love story about a political marriage of convenience between a Mughal emperor, Akbar, and a Rajput princess, Jodhaa. The beautiful and fiery daughter of King Bharmal of Amer, Jodhaa gets betrothed to another Rajput king and her dowry was her father's crown, which will pass to that Rajput king, after his death. Through this arrangement, the son of the elder brother of the king, Sujjamal gets deprived of his rightful throne and he leaves the kingdom angrily to join rebels. But when Mughal empire plans to attack Amer, king Bharmal, resentfully offers his daughter's hand to the emperor himself to avoid war. Akbar agrees to the marriage as it would bring forward a true strong alliance and long lasting peace between the empire and Rajputs. Jodhaa completely resented being reduced to a mere political pawn and she wants to marry Rajput king she was betrothed previously. She writes a letter to Sujjamal, her cousin (whom she sees as her own brother) entreating him to come rescue her from the marriage, she couldn't send it, though. Jodhaa shares all her misery with her mother, who tells her to send a servant girl in her place. Jodhaa replies that it would deceive Akbar and would be death to their kingdom if he finds out. Then, her mother gives her a vial of poison and tells her to use it if a need arises. After their marriage, Jodhaa acts reluctant with Akbar and they do not consummate their marriage. Later Akbar controls the rebellion and announces that every religion has its rights in his kingdom. Eventually, he becomes the founder of a new religion called Din-e-Ellahi, which combines both Hinduism and Islam. Following the success of Lagaan (2001), its director Ashutosh Gowariker was approached by actor and screenwriter Haidar Ali with the idea of making a film along the lines of K. Asif's historical epic, Mughal-E-Azam (1960).[a] When Gowariker contemplated on whether he should make a sequel to Mughal-E-Azam or remake it, Ali suggested that he do a prequel of sorts to it; Gowariker agreed and decided to create a screenplay that would cover the early years of Akbar's life from 13 to 28. In an interview with Syed Firdaus Ashraf of Rediff.com, Ali said on his decision to work with Gowariker: Ashutosh is the only director who could do justice to a film of such a level. In Lagaan, he touched on the issue of casteism, the oppressed class, Hindu-Muslim unity, communal harmony, team spirit, management and nationalism. He weaved all this beautifully to make a hit film without preaching or lecturing. In the same way, I told him he could make a beautiful film by touching on such issues without preaching. Gowariker had already finished his script for Swades (2004) when Ali pitched the idea. As a result, he decided to start his work with Ali after completing it. In December 2001, Ali began research on the marriage of princess Jodhabai, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Amer, Bharmal with the Mughal emperor Akbar, and prepared a basic story on the couple. One month after Swades was released, Ali met Gowariker and handed to him the story. Gowariker subsequently announced his next project, terming it \"a romantic musical\", titled Jodhaa Akbar. In March 2005, Gowariker started work on the screenplay with Ali while denying speculations that Firoz A. Nadiadwala and Subhash Ghai were producing the film. It was confirmed later in August 2006 that Gowariker would co-produce the film himself under his banner AGPPL productions with Ronnie Screwvala of UTV Motion Pictures, in addition to the latter distributing it. Ali and Gowariker completed the script in November 2005 and sought the help of Bhawani Singh, the Maharaja of Jaipur and his spouse, Maharani Padmini Devi to provide them with \"creative inputs to make Jodhaa Akbar as realistic as possible.\"[b] K. P. Saxena was hired to write the film's dialogues. Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai were the first choice of both Ali and Gowariker for portraying Akbar and Jodhabai respectively. Gowariker believed Roshan possessed the regal bearing and physique required to play the role of a king. According to Gowariker, Roshan immediately agreed after the former merely mentioned that he was doing a film on Akbar. Roshan learned Urdu as a means of preparing for his role. For casting Rai, Gowariker sent her a SMS asking \"Will U B My Jodha?\" to which Rai sent a reply stating \"Yes, I will\" followed by a smiley. Sonu Sood was chosen to play Jodhabai's brother Rajkumar Sujamal. Sood had rejected offers to feature in other projects as he wanted to fully involve himself in the film. The role of Akbar's mother, Hamida Banu Begum, was first offered to Saira Banu, who declined citing family commitments as her reason. The role subsequently went to Poonam Sinha which marked a comeback for her to acting since her brief stint in the 1970s. Actress and singer Ila Arun had wanted to work with Gowariker and approached him for a role in the film; Gowariker cast her as Akbar's nurse, Maham Anga. Nikitin Dheer was selected to play Sharifuddin Hussain, the rebellious brother-in-law of Akbar, after impressing Gowariker during the auditions. Kulbhushan Kharbanda portrayed Raja Bharmal while Suhasini Mulay was cast as Jodhabai's mother, Rani Padmavati. Actress Abir Abrar, niece of yesteryear actress Kumkum, was selected to play Bakshi Banu Begum, Akbar's sister and Hussain's wife. Indrajeet Sarkar was cast in the role of Birbal, but his scenes were cut from the film's final version to reduce its duration. A. R. Rahman, Javed Akhtar, Nitin Chandrakant Desai and Ballu Saluja were signed up as the music composer, lyricist for the songs, art director and editor respectively, thereby collaborating with Gowariker for the third time after Lagaan and Swades. Visual Computing Labs (VCL), a division of Tata Elxsi, were in charge of the film's special effects. Kiran Deohans, known for his work in Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988), Aks (2001) and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), was the film's cinematographer. Gowariker chose Ravi Dewan to be the stunt co-ordinator for Jodhaa Akbar based on the latter's experience in handling historical films, such as 1942: A Love Story (1994). Chinni Prakash and his wife Rekha, Raju Khan and Ash Kumar were the film's choreographers. Neeta Lulla, who had earlier worked with Rai in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas (2002), was chosen to handle the film's costume designing. Lulla found Jodhaa Akbar to be \"one of the most challenging films\" she had done. This was because she had to design costumes not only for the lead actress, but for every cast member involved in the film. Lulla did extensive research for a year and a half on the type of clothes people wore during the Mughal Empire. She went to Jaipur to procure information on what type of fabrics were worn during that period. She schematically designed clothes by providing yellow, orange and red colours for the Rajputs and gold, brown and beige colours for the Mughals. Keeping in mind the grandeur of the Mughal Empire during Akbar's time, Lulla used the Zardozi and Kundan types of embroidery for Roshan's and Rai's dresses. The fabrics for designing the costumes as well as the shoes were bought from Delhi, Mumbai and Jaipur, while authentic embroidered Mojaris were used for footwear. Lulla designed clothes of dark brown, black and green colours for the character of Sharifuddin Hussain after taking the characters' persona into consideration. The jewellery used for the costumes were purchased from the jewellery brand company Tanishq. Jodhaa Akbar marked the company's second venture into films after the fantasy film Paheli (2005). A team of 200 craftsmen worked for 600 days to fashion and mould jewels made of gold gemstones. Around 300 kilograms of jewels were used. Rai and Roshan wore thirteen and eight sets of jewels respectively throughout the film. The set, which Aishwarya wore in the scene where Jodhabai is wedded to Akbar weighed 3.5 kilograms. Rai was difficult for her to wear them, later mentioning in subsequent interviews that the toughest part of playing her character was to wear the jewellery. The jewels were designed using miniature paintings from Mughal literature and Akbar's autobiography by Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, the Akbarnama as influences. The scabbards used by the lead actors in the film weighed two kilograms. Filming commenced in early November 2006 at Jaipur with the climax sequence with Roshan and Dheer, and the First Battle of Panipat. Palace scenes featuring Rai as Jodhaabai before her marriage to Akbar were filmed at the Roopangarh Fort in Kishangarh. The sequence featuring the Battle of Panipat was shot in the Dhula region located on the outskirts of Jaipur. To prepare for their fight sequences, Roshan and Rai learnt sword-fighting and horse-riding a month before filming began at Mehboob Studio and Mahalaxmi Racecourse respectively. Rai had learnt sword-fighting and horse-riding while filming The Last Legion (2007) because of which she had little difficulty in her preparations. Dewan worked with Desai in designing the armour and ammunitions. The cannons were made of carbon fibre with iron inserted on the inner portions to make sure the cannonballs were fired smoothly. The swords were initially made of both wood and fibre but were later made of lightweight carbon fibre due to the actors not being able to manoeuvre them easily. All of the stunt sequences were rehearsed everyday from 3 am to 7 am before they were filmed. A team of 250 stuntmen and 5,000 extras were used for all the battle scenes, which were filmed for 20-30 days at a stretch. Ashutosh wanted the climax to be perfect because of which the extras, who were people from nearby villages and were used for Akbar's and Hussain's armies, would often get tired standing in the same position for an entire day. Some of them would not be present the next day. As a result, Dewan placed the 250 stuntmen in the front rows of both armies so as not to show how exhausted the villagers were. Deohans employed six cameras to film the climax scene from different angles. He was influenced by films such as Gladiator (2000) and Troy (2004) as he found the \"basic colour\" of those films' locations similar to that of Rajasthan's arid surroundings. The lighting was used depending on the scenes filmed. Further shooting took place at Sambhar Lake Town, and the forts of Amber, Amer and Agra. The scene where Akbar prays to the Islamic scholar Moinuddin Chishti for a successful conquest of India was filmed at the Ajmer Sharif Dargah. After the completion of the first schedule of filming\u2014which took in 60 days\u2014by the end of December 2006, the second schedule began on 8 January 2007 at Desai's ND Studios based in Karjat. Desai took \"lakhs of photographs\" of Amer Fort and Agra fort. Using the photos as reference, he erected sets consisting of the inner portions of both places in his studio. Filming could not take place entirely at the forts due to heavy traffic of tourists coming there everyday. Consequentially, only the outer portions of both the forts were filmed on the spot during the first schedule while the scenes featuring the inner portions were filmed at Karjat. The inner portions that were erected by Desai included the D\u012bw\u0101n-e-\u0100m, D\u012bw\u0101n-e-Kh\u0101s, Jodhaabai's inner chambers and the fort's gardens. The entire set measured 1,600 feet long, 600 feet wide and 68 feet high, which according to Desai was equivalent to \"seven floors of a high-rise\". Concrete, fibre and asbestos sheets were the materials used to create the interiors of the forts. The cost of the entire set at Karjat was estimated to be around \u20b9120\u00a0million. The song \"Azeem-O-Shaan Shahenshah\", which was choreographed by Prakash, featured about 12 assistant choreographers, 400 dancers and 2,000 extras acting as the citizens of Agra. Prakash used the dance steps featured in the songs of films such as Ganga Jamuna (1961) and Guide (1965) as reference. The song was planned to be finished within 10 days but took 15 days to complete as Prakash felt it was \"difficult to stick to a deadline when you have a crowd this big.\" He credited his team for finishing the song as he believed it would have taken \"a month\" to film without their co-operation. A total of 80 elephants, 100 horses and 55 camels were employed throughout the entire film. The battle scene featuring Roshan and Ulhas Barve, who plays the King of Mankeshwar, Chittorgarh district, was filmed in June 2007 at Jaipur. Shooting was completed in October\u2013November 2007 at Karjat. Due to the amount of money spent on the costumes and sets, the budget of the film, which was initially \u20b9370\u00a0million, increased to \u20b9400\u00a0million. Many of the events portrayed in the movie are based on real events. Certain Rajput groups claimed Jodhaa was married to Akbar's son, Jahangir, not Akbar. Several historians claim that Akbar's Rajput wife was never known as \"Jodhaa Bai\" during the Mughal period. According to Professor Shirin Moosvi, a historian of Aligarh Muslim University, neither the Akbarnama (a biography of Akbar commissioned by Akbar himself), nor any historical text from the period refer to her as Jodhaa Bai. Moosvi notes that the name \"Jodhaa Bai\" was first used to refer to Akbar's wife in the 18th and 19th centuries in historical writings. In Tuzk-e-Jahangiri, she is referred to as Mariam-uz-Zamani. According to historian Imtiaz Ahmad, the director of the Khuda Baksh Oriental Public Library in Patna, the name \"Jodhaa\" was used for Akbar's wife for the first time by Lieutenant-Colonel James Tod, in his book Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan. According to Ahmad, Tod was not a professional historian. N. R. Farooqi claims that Jodhaa Bai was not the name of Akbar's Rajput queen; it was the name of Jahangir's Rajput wife. Ashutosh Gowarikar's reaction was, The portrayal of ethnic Rajput people in the movie was criticised by members of the Rajput community as misleading, politically motivated historical revisionism that minimised Rajput history. The community's protests against the film in some states led to the film being banned in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttarakhand. However, the producer went to the Supreme Court to challenge it. Later, the Supreme Court of India lifted the ban on screening the film in Uttar Pradesh and some towns of Uttarakhand and Haryana. The court scrapped the Uttar Pradesh government ban as well as similar orders by authorities in Dehradun, Uttarakhand and Ambala, Sonepat and Rewari, Haryana. The film received a critics rating of 69 on Metacritics, and Rotten Tomatoes has given the film a 83%\u00a0rating with 10\u00a0fresh and 3 rotten reviews. Anil Sinanan of The Times gave the film four out of five stars stating, \"Oscar-nominated Lagaan director Ashutosh Gowariker's sumptuous period epic has all the ingredients of a Cecil B. DeMille entertainer [...] The film ends with a passionate plea for tolerance of all religions in India, a resonant message for modern India.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN also gave the film four out of five stars commenting: \"I've never felt this way about any other film, but sitting there in my seat watching Jodhaa Akbar, I felt privileged as a moviegoer. Privileged that such a film had been made, and privileged that it had been made in our times so we can form our own opinions of the film rather than adopt the opinions of previous generations, which we invariably must when looking at older classics.\" Tajpal Rathore of the BBC gave the film four out of five stars, noting that, \"although the 16th-century love story upon which it's based might be long forgotten, this endearing treatment sears into the memory through sheer size and scale alone [...] Don't let the running time put you off watching this unashamedly epic tale.\" Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film three stars, stating that, \"Jodhaa Akbar works only because its heart is in the right place. The film talks about a love that transcends all barriers \u2013 gender, religion, culture \u2013 and dreams of an India where secularism and tolerance are the twin towers that should never ever crumble. And Akbar and Jodhaa are the alluring exponents of this dream.\" Kazmi also suggests that \"if you are willing to shed off all the trappings of history, only then will Jodhaa Akbar work for you.\" While suggesting that the film is \"too long\" and that it is \"not a history lesson,\" Rachel Saltz of The New York Times also notes, \"in choosing to tell the tale of this emperor and a Muslim-Hindu love story, Mr. Gowariker makes a clear point. As Akbar says, 'Respect for each other's religion will enrich Hindustan.'\" Jodhaa Akbar collected \u20b9379.02 million in India and was declared a semi hit by Box Office India. In overseas, it grossed $7,550,000 (\u20b949.92 crores) and was declared a blockbuster. The film grossed $2,100,000 in UK, $3,450,000 in North America, $960,000 in UAE, $450,000 in Australia and $590,000 in rest of the world. The film ended with a worldwide lifetime gross of \u20b9515.42 million($28,370,000). The acclaimed score and soundtrack of the film was composed by A. R. Rahman, making his third collaboration with Ashutosh Gowariker after Lagaan, and Swades. The official soundtrack contains five songs and two instrumentals. Rahman scored the prewritten lyrics by Javed Akhtar, except for the songs \"Khwaja Mere Khwaja\" and \"Azeem-O-Shaan Shahenshah\". The former was written by Kashif while the latter was by Javed Akthar himself. The music was released on 9 January 2008 and the CDs were out by 18 January. The soundtrack album was met with very positive reviews, with most of the reviewers hailing the album a magnum opus by Rahman. Aakash Gandhi of Planet Bollywood reviewed the album saying \"Jodhaa Akbar compositions are magical, spectacular, invigorating and above all a wholesome experience you rarely get in soundtracks these days. When you cannot pick a favourite you know the benchmark has been set consistently high. Indian music has just added another soundtrack to its eternal treasure.\" The film emerged out as the biggest winner in many music awards. However, in the best music direction category, it lost many mainly to Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na, composed by Rahman himself. The fine background score won the film many awards including Filmfare Best Background Score and IIFA Best Background Score. The soundtrack was also nominated in numerous categories.  International",

The film stars Aamir Khan, Ayesha Jhulka,Deepak Tijori, Pooja Bedi, Mamik Singh & Kulbhushan Kharbanda in the lead roles, whilst Aamir's brother, Faisal Khan makes a special appearance. The music was by Jatin Lalit. The plot has certain similarities to the 1979 American movie Breaking Away. It was an inspiration for the 1999 Telugu film Thammudu which went on to be remade in Tamil as Badri (2001) and in Kannada as Yuvaraja (2001) and in Bengali in 2003 as Champion. The film won the Filmfare award for best movie that year.   The movie is set in Dehradun in India. The movie opens with the description of the various colleges in the city. The Rajput college has students from affluent backgrounds with each student being an heir to a multimillion fortune. In contrast, the Model college has students from poor local households. Other colleges include Xaviers College and Queens College, the latter being an all-girls college with the guys from all three colleges trying to woo the students there. The highlight of the town is the annual inter-college sports championship with a marathon cycle race as the prime event. In the beginning of the film, the race is contested between Ratan Lal Sharma (Mamik Singh) of Model College and Shekhar Malhotra (Deepak Tijori) of Rajput College with the latter winning the race because Ratan had an inferior bike. After the race both are felicitated by their respective schools. Shekhar becomes cocky and arrogant. Sanju (Aamir Khan) is Ratan's younger brother and is everything that Ratan is not. He's a carefree youngster who is full of himself and is always in trouble with his father Ramlal (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), who wants him to act more maturely and become responsible like Ratan. Sanju and his little gang, which includes Anjali (Ayesha Jhulka) (who has a crush on Sanju), bunk sports to smoke cigarettes and roam around town. Anjali and her dad run a vehicle repair shop and Anjali's father asks his daughter to stay away from Sanju. Ramlal and his family run a small cafe which is the hangout spot for most of the college students. A number of scuffles occur between Sanju and Shekhar because of Shekhar's attempts to humiliate Ratan and his dad. Enter Devika (Pooja Bedi), who immediately catches the fancy of both Sanju and Shekhar. Initially she leans towards Shekhar but one day she misses her bus on the way to a picnic to meet Shekhar. Meanwhile, Sanju asks Anjali for a car so that he can roam around town. While on his way he spots Devika and leaves his friends at the paan shop and gives Devika a lift. Devika upon reaching her destination finds Shekhar with another girl and goes along with Sanju who, although not rich, brags about his wealth. Sanju's lie is ultimately revealed when Devika sees him dancing in the Model College group during a dance competition. After the show, Sanju and Devika break up that evening and in heated argument, Sanju fights with Shekhar's friends. Sanju is almost overpowered when his brother intervenes and chases Shekhar's friends away. Ramlal asks Sanju for the money he had given him to deposit in the bank (which he spent on Devika) which leads to a heated argument between Sanju and his dad and Sanju leaves the house Next morning, Ramlal leaves for town and Ratan is out cycling. Ratan tells Sanju that his Dad has forgiven him and asked him to return home, which Sanju, in anger, ignores. A heated argument and fight ensue between Ratan and Shekhar, which ends with Ratan accidentally falling off a cliff. While Ratan is in hospital, Sanju recollects his childhood with Ratan. When his father returns, he reconciles with him. With Ratan in the hospital, Sanju becomes more responsible and starts to care for his father and bed ridden brother. He decides that he will participate in the race with the help of Anjali and give it his best for Ratan. During his training, he realises his true feelings for Anjali and the two accept each other. A day before the race, Sanju finds out about the real cause of the accident and confronts Ratan who tells him that he didn't say anything because Sanju had become responsible and closer to all of them. Ratan asks Sanju to give his best in the race if he wants to do something for him. With his new cycle, Sanju participates in the race. The race begins evenly with both Sanju and Shekhar going head to head. Somewhere in the middle, the two fall and a scuffle ensues between Sanju and Shekhar and his friends. During this, other cyclists take the lead. Shekhar heads back on track with his friends holding Sanju back. Sanju breaks free and joins the race, catching up with Shekhar during the final laps of the race and finally beating him in the closing moments, giving Model College, his father and brother their long-awaited victory. Akshay Kumar had auditioned and Milind Soman was signed for Malhotra's role before Tijori played it. Aditya Pancholi was selected to play the role of Ratan however the role went to Mamik Singh as confirmed by DNA The music for the movie was composed by Jatin Lalit and lyrics were penned by Majrooh Sultanpuri. The soundtrack, their second collaboration, helped to launch their careers. It was nominated for Best Music at the Filmfare Awards 1993.

The technique was later used in many films and music videos. Pehla Nasha was the most popular track of the album and has become a cult song. Other popular tracks were \"Humse Hai Sara Jahan\", \"Rooth Ke Humse\" and \"Arre Yaaron Mere Pyaaron\".

The movie has been shot predominantly in various locations in the south of India, primarily Kodaikanal.",

Javed Khan (Shashi Kapoor) is a feckless feudal chieftain with a Muslim Pathan heritage, whose world revolves around breeding carrier pigeons. His younger brother-in-law, Sarfaraz Khan (Naseeruddin Shah) is politically awakened and actively plots the fight against the British. Freedom fighters attack the local British administrators while they are in Sunday Worship at Church, massacring them all. Miriam Labadoor ( Jennifer Kendal) manages to escape with her daughter, Ruth (Nafisa Ali) and mother. The three women seek refuge with the wealthy Hindu family of Lala Ramjimal (Kulbhushan Kharbanda). Lala is torn between his loyalty for India and his privileged position under the British. However, matters are taken out of his hand by Javed Khan who barges into Lala's house and forcibly takes Ruth and her family to his own house. This leads to jealousy on part of his wife, Firdaus (Shabana Azmi) and anger on part of his brother, who ultimately gives in to the Pathan tradition of offering hospitality and sanctuary (Nanawatai) even to uninvited guests. Various situations ensue due to cultural misunderstandings in the domestic routine of the Muslim household with its new English guests. Javed falls in love with Ruth, and wants to marry her but is opposed bitterly by her mother. Noticing intense feelings of Javed for her daughter Ruth, Miriam Labadoor (mother) cleverly makes an agreement with Javed that she would only give her daughter\u2019s hand to Javed if British were defeated. At first instance, Javed is hesitant but accepts the offer when again Miriam asks him if he has misgivings in his war against the British. There are simmerings of a love affair under the watchful suspicious eyes of Firdaus. Meanwhile, the Rebellion runs into problems and the British are defeating the poorly organized Indian forces. In a stormy scene, Sarfaraz destroys Javed's pigeon coops and sets his pets free after he finds out that Indian forces have lost the Battle for Delhi. There is a delayed recognition by Javed of his subjugated identity, colonised by the British. Sarfaraz dies in a battle against the British. The Labadoors return to the protection of the re-deployed British contingent, smuggled by Firdaus, who only wants to save her marriage. Javed finds out that the Labadoors have sought sanctuary in the church and rushes there to meet Ruth one last time. Surprisingly, Ruth comes out and expresses her feelings for Javed against her mother\u2019s will. However, Javed honourably keeps his word and the promise he had made with Miriam Labadoor and leaves the church without Ruth. The movie ends here with the voiceover that Javed was martyred fighting the British while Ruth and her mother return to England. Ruth dies fifty five years later, unwed. The soundtrack features 4 songs, composed by Vanraj Bhatia, with original lyrics from Yogesh Praveen and other lyrics by Amir Khusro, Jigar Moradabadi and Sant Kabir.",

Maya (Rani Mukerji) is an orphan who is to marry her closest childhood friend Rishi Talwar (Abhishek Bachchan). The two have been raised by Rishi's fun-loving father Samarjeet a.k.a. Sam (Amitabh Bachchan). Dev Saran (Shah Rukh Khan) is a \"successful soccer player\" in the United States. He lives in New York with his wife Rhea (Preity Zinta), a fashion magazine editor, his young son Arjun (Ahsaas Channa) and his mother Kamaljeet a.k.a. Kamal (Kirron Kher). Dev encounters Maya moments before she is to marry Rishi, and the two have a deep conversation about love, life and happiness. Although Dev and Maya are strangers, they connect instantly. When Dev bids Maya goodbye, she tells him they should never say goodbye because it kills the possibility of meeting again. Moments after they part, Dev is hit by a car and permanently injures his leg; as a result, he is no longer able to play soccer. Four years later, Dev is now extremely bitter because of his inability to play soccer and because of Rhea's successful career which makes him feel inferior to her. Maya too is in a similar situation. She has found that she is infertile and does not feel any love towards Rishi because she believes he is selfish. The two couples meet and become friends. When Dev and Maya witness Sam and Kamal embracing at a flower shop, they confront them about it. Sam and Kamal explain that both having lost their spouses, they understand each other better than the others as both of them are in similar situations and have decided to help one another through their loneliness by means of friendship. Dev and Maya notice each other's marriages failing miserably, and taking into account what Sam and Kamal said, they decide that they need to help each other save their marriages. They meet every day for coffee and discuss their situations and advise each other in understanding their respective spouses better. Eventually, Dev and Maya decide to take a break from the stress of their respective relationships and spend some quality time together. In doing so, they find themselves drawn to one another. Dev and Maya arrange a dinner for their respective spouses on the occasion of their wedding anniversaries so as to salvage their respective marriages to some extent. After returning home from the dinner, both couples have an argument. Rhea accuses Dev of being jealous of her professional success and also makes Dev realize his failure in being a good father to their son. Rishi expresses frustration at the lack of affection that Maya has shown towards him and he resents Maya's inability to have children. Upset and misty-eyed, Maya arrives at the train station and finds Dev, who after a confrontation finally confesses that he has fallen in love with Maya, and so has she. Sam and Kamal, after noticing the failing marriages of their respective children, set up Rhea and Rishi into talking to each other about their marriages. Rhea and Rishi realize they need to stop arguing with their spouses and reach out to them. For a while, both marriages seem to be fine; however, Dev and Maya begin an affair, as they are happier with each other than with their respective spouses. The two couples attend a ballet show, where Dev and Maya try making each other jealous by showing affection to their partners. The next day, they realize that they have been playing with their spouses' feelings but nevertheless give in to their love and cross the forbidden limit by sleeping together. Sam invites the Sarans to dinner to celebrate Kamal's birthday. Here, after a conversation on love, marriage and fidelity, Dev 'jokingly' admits he loves Maya; Sam is the only one who realizes that Dev was being serious. The next day, Dev and Maya are caught in an embrace outside the train station by Sam and Kamal. Sam has a heart attack; on his deathbed, he advises Maya to leave Rishi, as neither of them is happy in the relationship and never will be. He also advises her that by being together in a loveless marriage, she was depriving Rishi and herself of true love and happiness in life. After Sam's death, Dev and Maya decide they must end their relationship and go back to their respective spouses, but first they must tell them the truth first about their extramarital affair; as lying to their spouses would never give them peace and happiness. Shocked and heart-broken, Rhea and Rishi decide they have had enough and divorce their spouses. Dev and Maya lie to each other and say that they have managed to sort things out with their spouses, believing they'll never meet again. Three years have passed since their last encounter with each other. Dev and Maya now live alone miserably and have not seen each other. Rishi visits Maya and says that he has fallen in love again and is remarrying, and wants Maya to be his best man, to which she agrees. Rhea, having also been invited, arrives at Rishi's wedding with her boss Jay (Arjun Rampal in a cameo), whom she is now dating. Rhea learns that Rishi and Maya are divorced \u2013 Rishi learns the same about Dev and Rhea. Rhea, after confronting Maya tells her that she had left Dev as soon as she came to know of his affair with her and that she had forgiven Maya. Maya is encouraged by Rishi and Rhea to stop Dev, who is leaving for Toronto by train, as they have both moved on and believe Maya should also find her true love and happiness. At the train station, Dev sees Maya but tries to avoid her, believing she is still with Rishi. However, Maya finds him just as the train leaves. Maya, disappointed and heart-broken, leaves the train station. Dev, having seen Maya's teary eyes, pulls the emergency stop and arrives back at the station. He makes it back before Maya leaves the train station. He calls out to Maya and both of them are glad to see each other after three years. He learns that Maya has also been divorced and was living alone in these three years. They finally find happiness with their true love and decide to start a new life together. At the end, Dev narrates that love should be the only foundation of marriage but it shouldn't be at the expense of hurting others. Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna was directed and written by Karan Johar who collaborated with Shibani Bathija to write the screenplay, and Niranjan Iyengar produced the dialogue. Produced by Dharma Productions, the soundtrack was performed by the musical trio, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar. Farah Khan was brought in to organise the choreographical aspects of the film, with costume designer Manish Malhotra, production designer Sharmishta Roy and MAC cosmetics all playing a major role in production. Kajol was initially offered the role of Maya Talwar. When she refused, due to her prior commitments with Yash Raj Films's Fanaa, the role was passed on to her cousin Rani Mukherji, who was supposed to play Preity Zinta's part. However, Kajol made a guest appearance in the song \"Rock 'N' Roll Soniye\". Riteish Deshmukh also had a guest appearance, but his scene was cut during the editing process. Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna is set in New York City, while many of the scenes were filmed nearby in East Hartford and New Haven in Connecticut. The soccer game scene was filmed at Rentschler Field, the home of the UConn Huskies football team. In several scenes, a light 'UConn' can be seen on the field. The majority of the Grand Central Station scenes were filmed at New Haven's Union Station and Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. It was filmed over a 90-day shooting period in the USA but a few scenes were shot on four large sets in Mumbai studios. Like previous Karan Johar movies (Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... and Kal Ho Naa Ho), Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna has a four-word title that starts with a \"K\". The music and score of Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna was composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy while the lyrics were penned by Javed Akhtar and the soundtrack was released on 16 June 2006 by Sony BMG in India. This is the second time that lyricist Javed Akhtar and the composers Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy have teamed up for a Dharma production. The title song Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna rendered by Sonu Nigam and Alka Yagnik is a tear jerker. Mitwa, an evocative sufi rock ballad, marked the introduction of Pakistani singer Shafqat Amanat Ali into the Bollywood scene. Rock 'N' Roll Soniye, picturized on Amitabh, Abhishek and Preity is a 60's Rock 'N' Roll track, sung by Shankar Mahadevan, Shaan and Mahalakshmi Iyer. Then follows Tumhi Dekho Naa, a soft and romantic ballad, which again is sung by the Sonu Nigam - Alka Yagnik duo, is picturised on Shah Rukh and Rani. Where's The Party Tonight? by Shaan, Vasundhara Das, Loy and Shankar Mahadevan is the club song picturized on Abhishek and Preity. Farewell Trance is the trance version of the title track, which is a rarity in Bollywood. The album also has a remix - Mitwa - Revisted. The trio took care to not make the album sound repetitive, especially since the overall genre of the soundtrack is similar to that of their previous chartbuster Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003). The music of Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna was launched in the United Kingdom on 12 June 2006 and was officially released in India on 16 June 2006 along with a grand music launch at the IIFA Awards function in Dubai. Though there were a few negative buzz around earlier at London where the music released, the overall reaction to the album was positive from all the mainstream critics. Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama dismissed those initial negative reaction, saying \"Much before the official release of the music album of KANK, rumour brigade has been having a field day in pulling down the album. Well, that's not something new as with every biggie comes its share of detractors. But on hearing the songs for yourself, you realize that is it NOTHING, but a rumour! The album is yet another fine product from the team that delivers the kind of path-breaking music expected from it.\" Sukanya Verma of Rediff called the album \" a treat for the melody-starved.\". The album opened at #1 and retained the top position in the music charts for ten straight weeks, despite facing tough competition from musical hits like Fanaa, Krrish and Gangster. According to the figures from BoxOffice India, the album sold over 1,900,000 copies in India making it the second best selling album of the year, marginally behind Dhoom 2. Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, with a multi-star cast, premiered on 12 August 2006 and was screened in over 1,200 cinemas worldwide. According to the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) originally gave the film an R rating because of language and some sexual content. It was re-rated PG-13 on appeal. On its release, the film received positive reviews from critics worldwide. Critic Taran Adarsh described the subject matter as a delicate one which could have easily been disastrous and praised the way in which director Karan Johar boldly constructed the film, citing it as his finest work to date. Adarsh approved in particular of the script and the devices the director incorporated to contrast emotions between scenes, remarking that, \"the screenplay balances the two extremes; light moments and dollops of emotions with amazing ease\". The individual cast performances were also praised by Adarsh, who commented on the effectiveness of the casting and the interaction of the actors. Rajeev Masand gave the film 4 out of 5 stars praising the screenplay and Johar's direction, saying \"Few writers have such solid control over their screenplay as Karan Johar does. Few understand the intricacies of narrative as well as he does. Johar goes from highs to lows, from plateaus to peaks with the ease of a pro. He knows exactly how to turn a seemingly ordinary scene into something special with just that one line of dialogue, or that hint of background music.\" Derek Elley of Variety also praised the diversity of emotions displayed by the cast, remarking that, \"scripter Shibani Bathija never lets her characters inhabit a secure emotional place for very long, and impediments to happiness come from their own weaknesses rather than social constraints or plot-generated misunderstandings\". Elley noted Amitabh Bachchan's performance as an ageing lothario and praised Preity Zinta as \"stepping far beyond her makeup\". Raja Sen of rediff.com was particularly critical of the film, also expressing dissatisfaction with its length. He remarked, \"I feel older. A showing of Karan Johar's mammoth 22-reel Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna has left me unbelievably exhausted. I walked out of the hall feeling my cheeks for stubble, wondering if my clothes are suddenly dated and my hair's turned grey. I've lost a sizeable chunk of my life, and you will too\". Unlike other critics, he identified flaws in the script and criticised the strength of characters saying \"The characters are cardboard, the setting is glitzy, the songs are tiresome, and the story oscillates between high melodrama and slapstick hilarity, going nowhere. Rarely has a weak script relied so completely on pretty people with big names to carry every line through\". In the United States, the film received a number of positive reviews. Critics such as Neil Genzlinger of the New York Times emphasised the larger-than-life nature of the film, remarking that, \"It is full of big Bollywood stars and outsized everything: the rainstorms are a little rainier than real life; the wind machines are cranked up an extra notch; the close-ups get closer and linger longer than usual; the coincidences that drive the plot are a little more numerous and unlikely than normal screenwriting allows\". He praised the humour in the script and the director's comic timing in certain scenes such as the children's soccer match, the bed store, and at the ballet show. Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna saw a record opening at many cities in India and generated \u20b9 600\u00a0million in the first week itself, although it is currently Johar's lowest-grossing film according to net collections, even if unadjusted for inflation. It emerged the highest grosser worldwide for an Indian film, surpassing Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham's five-year-old record. The film is currently the seventh highest grosser overseas with a total gross of $10 million. It opened strongly in the United States and the United Kingdom with first weekend grosses of $1.3 million in the U.S and $1.4 million (\u00a3750,000) in the UK In total Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna collected US$3,275,444 in the United States while in UK it netted over \u00a35,079,688.00. In the US, one factor contributing to its success was the fact it debuted in 64 theatres, unusually high for a Bollywood film in cities with lower Indian populations such as Miami, Tampa, and Raleigh as well.[citation needed] The film's total worldwide gross is of \u20b9 1.13\u00a0billion.

This was Yash Chopra's second directorial film with Amitabh Bachchan and Shashi Kapoor in the lead roles after Deewaar and was particularly noted for its soundtrack compositions by Khayyam, who won Filmfare Award for Best Music, while film lyricist Sahir Ludhianvi won the Best Lyricist Award for \"Kabhi Kabhie Mere Dil Mein,\" the song which also got singer Mukesh, the Best Male Playback Singer award.   Amit Malhotra (Amitabh Bachchan) recites one of his poems at a college / university where he meets fellow student Pooja (Raakhee), and they fall in love. But Pooja's parents arrange for her to marry an architect, Vijay Khanna (Shashi Kapoor). A heartbroken Amit returns home and joins his father's business - a construction company - and later marries Anjali (Waheeda Rehman), who secretly has a daughter named Pinky (Neetu Singh) from a pre-marital relationship. Amit and Anjali have a daughter, Sweetie. In the meantime, Pinky is adopted by childless couple Dr. and Mrs. R.P. Kapoor. Spanning over to the next generation, Pooja and Vijay have a son, Vikram (Rishi Kapoor), also known as \"Vicky\", who falls in love with Pinky while they are at a party, and the two plan to get married. When Pinky learns of her adoption and the identity of her real mother, she tries to get close to Anjali. While Anjali eventually acknowledges her existence and secretly showers her love on her reunited daughter, she does not reveal the relationship to her husband, fearing for her marriage. The situation is further complicated by Vicky's attempts to stay close to Pinky and Sweetie's romantic interest in Vicky. This sets in motion a chain of events that unites old flames as friends. The soundtrack includes the following tracks, composed by Khayyam, and with lyrics by Sahir Ludhianvi, both of whom won the Filmfare Award for the year. The \"Kabhi Kabhie Mere Dil Mein\" duet version, with Mukesh and Lata Mangeshkar, topped the year end Annual list 1976 of Radio Ceylon radio show, Binaca Geetmala. The soundtrack was listed by Planet Bollywood as number 7 on their list of 100 Greatest Bollywood Soundtracks. Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood gave 9.5 stars stating, \"Kabhi Kabhie will remain an ode to brilliant melody\". The film's concept came to Yash Chopra while he was reading a poem by his longtime friend (and also the film's lyricist) Sahir Ludhianvi. The movie was shot in Kashmir, and Yash Chopra has claimed this to be one of his happiest experiences and he described the production as a \"honeymoon\", since the entire cast worked together as a family. The film also led to the reinvention of Amitabh Bachchan as a romantic poet who loses his love, which was a major departure from his earlier \"angry young man\" roles such as Deewar and Zanjeer. The film had been written with Raakhee in mind, and she had agreed to do it during the making of Daag (1973) but before production started she married lyricist Gulzar, who wanted her to retire from acting. However, after some persuasion from Yash Chopra, Gulzar let her do the film.",

(English: Sometimes there's Happiness, Sometimes there's Sorrow), also known as K3G, is a 2001 Indian family drama film written and directed by Karan Johar and produced by Yash Johar. The film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor in leading roles, with Rani Mukerji appearing in an extended cameo appearance.

The film tells the story of an Indian family, which faces troubles and misunderstandings over their adopted son's marriage to a girl belonging to a lower socio-economic group than them. Development of the film began in 1998, soon after the release of Karan's debut film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998). Principal photography began on 16 October 2000 in Mumbai and continued in London and Egypt. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... was promoted with the tag-line \"It's All About Loving Your Parents\".

In 2003, it became the first Indian film to be given a theatrical release in Germany. Upon release, the film met with mixed reviews from film critics and received polarising reactions to Karan Johar's \"larger-than-life\" directorial style, some seeing it as an \"oddly hollow film\". Made on a budget of \u20b9400 million (US$6.2\u00a0million), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... emerged as a major commercial success, both domestically and internationally, with a lifetime gross of \u20b91.35 billion (US$21\u00a0million).

Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... won several awards at popular award ceremonies the following year, including five Filmfare Awards.   Yashvardhan \"Yash\" Raichand (Amitabh Bachchan) is a rich business tycoon, living in Delhi with his wife Nandini (Jaya Bachchan) and two sons Rahul and Rohan. Rahul is the elder son and was adopted by Yash and Nandini at birth. This is known to everyone in the Raichand household, except Rohan. The Raichand household is highly patriarchal and follows traditions. While grown up, Rahul (Shahrukh Khan) comes across the vivacious Anjali Sharma (Kajol), and they eventually fall in love, but their love is forbidden, because Anjali is from a low-income background. Yash and Nandini soon send Rohan to a boarding school, which all the males in their family have attended. Yash announces his desire for Rahul to marry Naina (Rani Mukherji), as he believes that parents have the right to choose their offspring's spouse, but Naina learns that Rahul is in love with Anjali, and encourages him to pursue her. When Yash comes to know of this, he is enraged, and Rahul promises not to marry Anjali, as he wants to please his father. En route to tell her of his promise, he discovers that her father (Alok Nath) has died, and decides to marry her despite his father's hostility. Yash learns of the marriage and disowns Rahul, whereupon Nandini and Rahul share a tearful goodbye. Nandini sends Sayeeda (Farida Jalal) (Rahul and Rohan's nanny) to watch over him, so that he does not feel separated from a mother's love. Rahul visits Rohan in the Boarding School and begs of Rohan never to ask where he went or why he left, and asks that he take care of Nandini. Ten years later, Rohan (Hrithik Roshan) returns home from boarding school and accidentally overhears a conversation from his grandmothers (Achala Sachdev and Sushma Seth) concerned Rahul's adoption and the reason why Rahul left home, whereupon Rohan vows to reunite the family. He learns that Rahul, Anjali, and her younger sister Pooja (with whom he shared a playful relationship during his childhood) moved to London, and tells his parents that he wishes to pursue further studies in London. Yash is skeptical at first, but once Rohan emphasizes that he is following the family traditions, his parents agree to let him go. In London, Rahul and Anjali now have their own son, Krish. Pooja (Kareena Kapoor), now a popular fashion-obsessed diva, is a student at King's College London, where Rohan enrolls. He and Pooja meet again and he tells her that he has come to London to bring his brother and sister-in-law back home. Pooja tells Rahul that Rohan is her friend's brother who currently has nowhere to stay. After some persuasion, Rahul agrees to let Rohan stay as Rohan uses the name 'Yash' to hide his real identity. At Krish's school function, he leads his class in singing Jana Gana Mana(Indian national anthem), and later recites advice which Rohan had given him. Rahul, having given Rohan this advice ten years ago, now realizes that Rohan is his brother. Rohan begs Rahul to come home, but he refuses. Pooja convinces Rohan to invite his parents to London; Rahul and Nandini are overjoyed to see one another, but Rahul still refuses to talk to his father. Yash soon learns that his mother had died and that her last wish was for Yash, Rahul, and Rohan to light her funeral pyre together. Therefore, the entire family attends the funeral, and Nandini tells Yash that she thought he was wrong for disowning Rahul. Rohan and Pooja convince Rahul to talk to Yash, who allows him and Anjali into the house. Rohan and Pooja are married, and the family hold a belated celebration of Rahul and Anjali's wedding. Achala Sachdev and Sushma Seth were cast as Yash and Nandini's mothers, respectively. The film also featured Johnny Lever as Haldiram (a shopkeeper in Chandni Chowk), Himani Shivpuri as Haldiram's wife, Jibraan Khan as Krish Raichand (Rahul and Anjali's son), Amar Talwar as Mr. Kapoor (Yash's friend and Naina's father). Ramona Sunavala, Jeroo Writer and Vikas Sethi feature as Poo's friends Sonya, Tanya and Robbie, respectively. Additionally, Ashutosh Singh features as Ashfaque, Rukshaar's husband. Shilpa Mehta, Shashikala and Parzan Dastur were cast as Ashfaque's mother, grandmother and nephew, respectively. Shashikala played the in-law to Rukhsaar. Punit Malhotra and Johnny Lever's real-life son Jesse Lever had small parts. After the success of Karan's debut film, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), he began work on a story dealing with the concept of \"generations\". The idea initially revolved around two daughters-in-law. However, on the advice of filmmaker Aditya Chopra, who thought that the male characters would be too weak, Karan decided to tweak the story-line to make it the story of two brothers. The inspiration behind Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... came from Yash Chopra's Kabhi Kabhie (1976). On being inspired by the classic, Karan quoted, \"What appealed to me was the fact that the love story stretched out across generations. It began with youth and went on as the people grew older. You could say that Kabhi Kabhie is the starting point for my new film, that I am inspired by it. But the film, I am sure, will be very different. It will look different, feel different.\" Similarly, Karan added an extra \"e\" to the second Kabhi in the title of his film, due to numerological reasons. In an interview with The Times of India, Karan dispelled comparisons with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and said that while his debut film was \"frothy and bubble-gummish\", this one was \"more classy and sophisticated\". He added that there would be \"plenty of drama\" in this film too, but handled more maturely. Before principal photography could begin, Karan and the contracted costume designers (Manish Malhotra, Shabina Khan and Rocky S) shopped in several locations of USA, London, Milan, and New Delhi to get the right look for each of the cast members. Additionally, Karan had only one expectation from the contracted actors; to \"look good and do their job\". He did not organise any rehearsals for them, except for a scene involving a climatic encounter between Amitabh Bachchan and Roshan. Additional production people hired included choreographer Farah Khan, production designer Sharmishta Roy and cinematographer Kiran Deohans. The first schedule of the film began in Mumbai on 16 October 2000, with the picturisation of the song \"Bole Chudiyan\" involving Roshan, Kapoor, Khan and Kajol. Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan joined the schedule on 20 October. Due to the immense stress caused by the presence of these actors, Karan fainted on the sets. However, he continued directing the rest of the song while lying in bed. For the first half of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., the production design team led by Sharmishtha Roy, recreated Chandni Chowk in a studio at Film City of Mumbai. In order to lend authenticity, the team took several pictures of the original area and also shopped in the various alleys of Chandni Chowk. Roy later won Filmfare Award for Best Art Direction her work. The inside of a palatial mansion was developed from scratch in the same studio to double as the home of the Raichand family. In order to lend authenticity to the house of the multi-multimillionaires, several expensive paintings were hung from the walls. A total of 18\u201319 elaborate sets were constructed by Roy, as Karan wanted the look of the film to be \"larger-than-life\". The second half of the film was shot in the city of London. Karan chose to set the film there due to his fondness for the city. He added, \"I could have based my plot in New York City or anywhere else. But London is kind of close to my heart. I like to weave my films around London.\" Shooting locations include the Wales Millennium Centre, Bluewater in Kent, Blenheim Palace, St Paul's Cathedral and the banks of River Thames. The outdoor scenes of the Raichand family mansion were shot at Waddesdon Manor. The crew faced enormous difficulties while filming an emotional scene between Jaya Bachchan and Khan at the Bluewater Complex, as a massive crowd had gathered there to watch them at work. The situation, eventually, got worse and the complex officials asked them to wrap up the shoot within two hours. Another song sequence (\"Suraj Hua Maddham\") involving Khan and Kajol was shot with the backdrop of the Pyramids of Giza in the city of Cairo in Egypt. Due to the lighting conditions, the crew could shoot only between 7 and 9\u00a0am in the morning. As a result, the song took several days to film. In addition, Kajol suffered from a minor injury while filming for the song, as she had experienced a bad fall. The music of the film was composed by Jatin Lalit, Sandesh Shandilya and Aadesh Shrivastava. The lyrics were provided by Sameer, except for \"Suraj Hua Maddham\" which was penned by Anil Pandey. A total of 11 tracks are present in the album, which was released by Sony Music on 16 October 2001. Explaining the album, Karan Johar said, \"I wanted music that had all kinds of tunes\u00a0\u2014 pop, romantic, bhangra\u00a0\u2013 but one sound. It had to be larger than life.\" He added that Jatin-Lalit came up with three \"haunting melodies\", while Shandilya and Shrivastava came up with the pop and bhangra songs, respectively. A legal suit was filed against Johar for using the song \"It's Raining Men\" in the film without obtaining prior permission. Upon release, the soundtrack of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... emerged as a major success by selling 2.5 million units within 30 days. Additionally, it became the largest selling album of the year in India. Writing for Rediff, Sukanya Varma praised most of the compositions, while being critical of the song \"Say Shava Shava\" due to the \"overdose of Punjabi emotions\". She summed up by saying, \"The music of K3G has a presence. Hate it or love it, you certainly won't ignore it.\" Planet Bollywood gave it 8 of 10 stars, calling \"Suraj Hua Maddham\" the best song, and the best reason to buy the album. In 2002, Sony released another album titled Klub K3G, featuring remixes by Indian electronic music producers Akshai Sarin, Harshdeep Sidhu, Prempal Hans and others. Initially scheduled for a theatrical release during the Diwali celebrations of 2001, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... released a month later on 14 December. Due to the long duration of the film, theatres screened three shows daily, instead of four. Additionally, due to a massive rush in advance bookings, several theatres increased their ticket prices. The use of \"Jana Gana Mana\" by Rabindranath Tagore during the film was met with criticism from a certain section of the audiences, and politicians of the Bharatiya Janata Party, for being \"out-of-context\" and \"insulting the national pride\". Subsequently, a writ was issued against Dharma Productions in the Allahabad High Court by a petitioner based in Uttar Pradesh. However, the court did not entertain the complainant's petition. In India, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... met with polarised reactions from film critics. While certain critics praised the visual richness and the performances of the cast, certain others were negative about the lengthy run time and criticised the script strength and inconsistencies. Khalid Mohamed of The Times of India applauded the film and reviewed, \"K3G is the complete commercial banquet delivered with fabulous finesse by Karan Johar. So, go indulge yourself. Cry your heart out and surprisingly, you'll feel life's finally alive and kicking in Mumbai's dream world.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 4.5 out of 5 stars. He praised the emotional sequences, as well as the choreography, production design, costumes, and cinematography. He added that Karan Johar was the real star, for creating many memorable sequences. Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood gave the film 8 out of 10 stars, saying \"Dharma Productions has kept its promise in giving us a lovable film to remember in coming times.\" He pointed out several flaws in the script, but added that the positive aspects of the film managed to outweigh the negative ones. He quoted, \"K3G is one heck of an entertainer and was worth the wait\". In the film review section of his book Bollywood: An Insider's Guide, Fuad Omar showered overwhelming praise on the film and called it a \"masterpiece from the first frame to the last\". In summary he said, \"Overall Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... is without a doubt the most enthralling, entertaining, emotional and complete vision and definition of Hindi cinema I have ever seen. It is simply the perfect Hindi film.\" Contrary to the positive reviews, Anjum N., writing for Rediff, said that despite an extraordinary cast and a big budget, \"Karan Johar disappoints.\" He praised Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan's performance and noted Hrithik Roshan for holding his own against the veteran actors. However, in summary he called the film \"a bad remix of Mohabbatein and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\". Writing for The Hindu, Ziya Salam praised Kajol's performance and Karan's ability to \"keep the viewer occupied\". She commented, \"Watch Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... not because of the hype which preceded its release but because in these meagre times not many have come up with better fare. The film at least partially redeems the hope surrounding it. Again, just like its name. Some joy, some disappointment.\" Namarata Joshi of Outlook gave a mixed review and said that while the film \"makes you laugh and cry alternately\", the shenanigans were nevertheless \"fake and affected\" and \"monochromatic despite the profusion of colours\". Overseas too, the reviews were mostly mixed, with several critics praising the technical production details of the film, while being somewhat less enthusiastic about the story line. Shamaila Khan of BBC gave the film 9 out of 10 stars and praised the performances of Khan, Kajol and Kapoor. She summed up by saying, \"(K3G is) a well made film, with some magical moments (hilarious and weepy) and possibly the world's best looking family!\" Derek Elley of Variety said that it \"is a highly enjoyable, often dazzlingly staged vehicle dragged down by a sluggish final half-hour\". He also praised the cinematography, and the picturisation of the song, \"Say Shava Shava\". Corey K. Creekmur, of the University of Iowa, said that there were many ignored or illogical plot points and inconsistencies between the moral messages meant to be portrayed and the manner in which they came off on screen. Overall, he called the film a letdown. Upon release, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... broke all opening records. The film opened to around \u20b970 million (US$1.1\u00a0million) nett collections in its first weekend in India, with the first week total at around \u20b9140 million (US$2.2\u00a0million). The domestic opening week collections were 70% higher than the previous record and never before had opening records been eclipsed by such large margins. It also set new records for the second and third weeks, by collecting \u20b9105 million (US$1.6\u00a0million) and \u20b980 million (US$1.2\u00a0million) respectively. The film went on to become the second highest grosser of 2001 domestically, netting \u20b9550 million (US$8.5\u00a0million) in India, and earning \"Blockbuster\" status. The film was released in around 125 prints in the overseas markets, grossing a total of $8.9 million at the end of its theatrical run. It performed very well in the United Kingdom, with a gross of $689,000 in its opening weekend. It thus debuted at the third position at the British box-office. The total earnings of the film reached over $3.2 million in the UK. The film also had the biggest opening ever for a Bollywood film in North America, with a gross of $1.1 million in 73 screens. However, according to a report by Rediff, the numbers were so high that the official reporting agency did not believe it, and asked for evidence that could not be furnished until after the reporting deadline had passed. If reported on time, the film would have opened at the number 10 spot in the North American box-office. However, according to figures from Box Office Mojo, the film debuted at the 32nd place at the American box office during the week of 4 January 2002. It eventually gathered a total of $2.9 million there. Additionally, in 2003, the film became the first from India to be given a theatrical release in Germany. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... earned a worldwide gross of \u20b91.35 billion (US$21\u00a0million). It was the highest-grossing film of the year in the overseas market, surpassing Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, which was the top grosser of the year. Its record of being the highest grosser in the overseas was broken only by Johar's next directorial, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). When adjusted for inflation, the film is still among the highest grossers worldwide. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... received fifteen nominations at the Filmfare Awards, ultimately winning five awards. In an interview with Filmfare, Karan Johar said that he was not dejected to have not won many awards at the ceremony, as he felt that Lagaan was \"a classic\" and deserved to win. The film won several awards at the International Indian Film Academy Awards (IIFA), and some at the Zee Cine Awards and Screen Awards ceremonies, among others. Among the cast members, Kajol and Jaya Bachchan won several awards in the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress category, respectively. At the 13th annual Valenciennes International Film Festival, the film won five major awards, including three Best Film awards and Best Actress for Kajol. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... received the highest number of acting nominations ever received (6) by a film at Filmfare Awards.[citation needed] Film critics and academics have analysed Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... in several ways. In the book, Encyclopedia of Religion and Film, Eric Mazur described several \"mythological subtexts\" in the film. While mentioning the opening scene of the film, which features the Raichand family worshiping \"Hindu deities during the annual Diwali holiday\", he explained that the scene allowed the Hindu audiences to participate in the darshan along with the characters. Author Rajani Mazumdar compared Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... to Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994) and added that the film dealt with themes of family and moral values through a \"spectacular stage that moves across global locations\". She further stated that the buildup to the story was juxtaposed with the backdrop of two contrasting places\u00a0\u2013 the Raichand home and the interiors of Chandni Chowk. While the Raichand house is described as \"expensive, almost like a museum\", Chandni Chowk is shown as a world of crowds, chaos and festivities. She also made a note of the use of frontal camera angles in order to ensure that the \"spectators eye travels throughout the interior expanse\". Writer Sangita Gopal analysed the \"intensification of the aesthetic effects of Hindi cinema\" in the narrative scheme of the film. During the confrontation scene between Yash and Rahul Raichand, a \"thundering background score\" coupled with \"360\u00b0 panning shots\" were used to build up melodrama. She added that while such scenes simply began by reprising previous face-offs in several melodramatic Hindi films (such as Mohabbatein of 2000), they gradually shifted \"to a more realist register as the framework moves from a sociology to a psychology of the family\". Mazur mentioned the use of \"dream sequences\" in the film as a means of escapism. He referred to the song \"Suraj Hua Maddham\" as an extradiegetic sequence that allowed Rahul and Anjali to be physically intimate \"in ways that they could not in the real world of the film.\" He added that the characters conveyed a plethora of emotions not through extensive dialogue but through the exchange of glances, which were demonstrated by extreme close-ups on their eyes. Writing for the book Movie Blockbusters, Andrew Willis commented that the film was specifically written to appeal to the Indian diaspora. He explained that the film was aimed at invoking nostalgia among the large section of NRI's in Canada, United Kingdom and North America. In the second half of the film, Rahul and Anjali move to London, where they enjoy an affluent lifestyle, among several non-Indian neighbours and friends. However, there is a perpetual dissatisfaction among them, especially Anjali, in living away from home. Additionally, she dresses up in a traditional sari and performs the duties of a loyal housemaker. She also frets about her son and younger sister being \"too influenced\" by Western culture. The film, thus tries to form an emotional connection with the expatriate Indian audiences. According to Eckstein, several sequences convey a \"culturally conservative\" and \"idealistic image\" of India, while maintaining that the diaspora living in Britain lead a life of \"involuntary exile\". Western ideology is equated with economic success, with emphasis on Western consumerism such as Starbucks and Burger King. Creekmur believes that Rohan was the only character in the film who could navigate multiple cultural spaces with ease. He seems totally at ease both at his ancestral home in India and in London. Though the tagline for the film was \"It's all about loving your parents\", Creekmur was skeptical and suggested \"the film seems to actually admonish stern fathers to trust and love their children \u2014 mothers, aunties, and grandmothers, of course, love their children unconditionally even while respecting the idiotic wishes of vain patriarchs.\" During the production and filming process, a book entitled The Making of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham was written by Niranjan Iyengar. It features materials and interviews concerning the producer, director, cinematographer, art director, cast and crew that Iyengar gathered over an 18-month period during the production of the film. The book was released a few days prior to the theatrical release of the film. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... has been released on VHS and DVD (one and two disc version) formats, beginning in 2002, and in the Blu-ray format beginning in 2010. The two disc DVD version of the film contains a 45-minute documentary entitled The Making of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham along with deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer, and several television promos.",

A sequel to the 2012 film Kahaani, the film features Vidya Balan, Arjun Rampal in lead roles and Jugal Hansraj and Kharaj Mukherjee in supporting roles. Principal photography took place from March 2016 to May 2016. The film was released on 2 December 2016. Kahaani 2 is the story of Durga Rani Singh who is charged with kidnapping and murder. It was declared tax-free in Uttar Pradesh on 15 December 2016. At the 62nd Filmfare Awards, Balan received a Best Actress nomination for her performance.

However, Minnie is a happy child and Vidya dotes on her, working hard to save money so that she can take Minnie to America in the hope that the girl will walk again. Vidya has resumed writing a personal diary after a long gap of eight years. One day, Vidya is forced to leave Mini home alone and unattended after waking up late. When she reaches work, she confirms through mobile that the nurse has arrived to look after Mini. When she returns home in the evening, her daughter is missing. A distraught Vidya finds out that the nurse hadn't come because she received a phone call from someone (pretending to be Vidya), telling her not to come. Vidya then receives a call from an unknown man asking her to come to an address if she does not want to see Mini dead. When she attempts to cross the road, a taxi knocks her down, sending her into a coma. She is admitted by the taxi-driver into a local nursing home of Dr. Maity (Pradip Mukherjee). A sub-inspector, Inderjeet Singh (Arjun Rampal) is put on Vidya's case. He visits the nursing home to see Vidya in coma. He gets a rude shock when he sees Vidya, as her face resembles that of Durga Rani Singh, whom he had known. He visits Vidya's home and finds her diary, which he takes in his custody to go through. Inderjeet's senior, Pranab Halder (Kharaj Mukherjee), informs him that Durga is wanted for a kidnapping and murder case. Inderjeet's wife Rashmi (Manini Chadha), a homemaker and mother of their daughter hasn't yet warmed up to Chandan Nagar and keeps asking him to take transfer to Kolkata. Inderjeet assures her that he is investigating a case and there is nothing personal. As Inderjeet starts reading Durga's diary, her past is revealed. She worked as a clerk in a school in Kalimpong as Durga Rani Singh. She is friendly with Arun (Tota Roychoudhury) and it's obvious that Arun has feelings for her. Durga is interested in a future with Arun too, but something from her own past still haunts her. At school, she noticed that a student named Minnie Dewan (Naisha Khanna) was always punished for sleeping during classes. When after repeated attempts at befriending reclusive Minnie fail, Durga decides to visit Minnie's grandmother (Amba Sanyal), pretending to be a teacher. She offers private tuition to spend time and get close to Minnie. She gradually wins Minnie's confidence. Durga's worst fears come true when Minnie confides that her uncle Mohit Dewan (Jugal Hansraj) was sexually abusing her. It is now clear from Durga's was also a survivior of child sex abuse and she informs Minnie's grandmother but she disbelieves Durga and admonishes her and fires her from the tuition job for Minnie. He is offered a job abroad and wishes to take her with him.Durga challenges Minnie's grandmother and Mohit that she would expose Mohit so that he is punished. She tries to file a case against him with the police but the policewoman (Gargi Bharadwaj), taking the side of Minnie's grandmother, thrashes and threatens Durga from pursuing further. Minnie is severely admonished by her grandmother and Mohit for confiding with Durga. She jumps off the terrace in desperation and becomes paralyzed waist down. Durga decides to save Minnie from her family and has a fight with her grandmother, who gets killed accidentally in the incident. Arun tries to locate Durga before his departure but is unable to do so. He dejectedly leaves for abroad. Durga flees with Minnie, settling in Chandan Nagar, with a new name, Vidya Sinha. But Mohit hunts them down and gets Minnie kidnapped with the help of the police woman. The story then comes back to the present time. The kidnapper policewoman comes to the nursing home and threatens Vidya to pay ransom to save Minnie, who has been kidnapped by Mohit and her. She throttles the patient on the next bed to death before leaving to emphasize that she means business. Terrified Vidya escapes from the hospital after recovering from coma and goes back to home in search of the address that the kidnapper had asked her to come to. She is caught by Halder and Inderjeet at her home. However, she is successful in escaping from there, as she shoots Inderjeet in his right arm. Vidya then arrives at Kolkata, where she goes to docks area as asked by Mohit and the woman kidnapper. Here Vidya offers the money withdrawn from her account to pay ransom to the kidnapper woman. Mohit shoots her dead when he finds her attracted to get the ransom offered. He then tries to strangulate Vidya, but is shot dead by the same revolver by Minnie. Vidya then calls Inderjeet to seek his help, but Haldar and other police officer ask Inderjeet to call her to a place where they can arrest her, as she is a criminal. Inderjeet asks Vidya to come to his paternal house, where they are surrounded by the police force. Halder tries to come near to Vidya, but she shoots him on his leg. Later, she pours kerosene oil and leaks the gas from cylinder in order to blast the house (in order to kill everybody inside the house). But when, Halder asks for mercy from her on the behalf of his 8 year-old child, she allows him and Inderjeet to walk out of the house. Few minutes later, the house gets blasted. In the next scene, it is seen that Halder comes out of the police headquarters as he has received a promotion. Then his wife Rashmi informs him that she has now started liking Chandan Nagar. It is finally revealed that Vidya's real name is Durga Rani Singh and she was married to Inderjeet Singh at a very young age. Durga after recovering from coma asked Inderjeet for his help and they planned her escape. It was Inderjeet, who helped Durga in arranging fake passports (in the name of Vidya Sinha) for her and for her daughter. He helped her in escaping to Kolkata in the police Ambassador car, inside the car trunk. Finally, he helped her from escaping from the house which got blasted. It is seen that Durga is alive, (who is believed to be dead as a criminal by police department) and is traveling to New York City for Minnie's operation. They arrive at the Children's Hospital. Inderjeet is seen happily driving with his family. The film ends with Durga assuring Minnie \u2013 \u201bAs long as I am alive, nothing can happen to you\u2019. Sarthak Dey Sarkar as guest appearance (Child). In March 2012, Ghosh announced that he intended to develop Kahaani into a series. He was inspired by Satyajit Ray's Feluda detective series and wanted to continue the stories of Vidya Bagchi on similar lines, with Vidya Balan reprising the role. The shooting of Kahaani 2 was scheduled to begin in 2013, but in July 2013 differences arose between Sujoy Ghosh and other co-producers. In February 2014, Vidya announced that the film was not happening due to these differences, but two years later, Ghosh confirmed that the film was in pre-production with Vidya set to reprise her role. The film, titled Kahaani 2, began filming in March 2016 with Arjun Rampal and Vidya in lead roles. In October 2016, upon its teaser release, the film was renamed as Kahaani 2: Durga Rani Singh. Initially, Durga Rani Singh was intended to be a standalone film with actor Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, but, as the story is too similar to Kahaani franchise, makers has included the project as a sequel to Kahaani.

        "full_text": " Kahaani (IPA:\u00a0[k\u0259\u02c8\u0266a\u02d0ni]; \"Story\") is a 2012 Indian Hindi-language mystery thriller film co-written, co-produced and directed by Sujoy Ghosh. It stars Vidya Balan as Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant woman searching for her missing husband in Kolkata during the festival of Durga Puja, assisted by Satyoki \"Rana\" Sinha (Parambrata Chatterjee) and Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Made on a shoestring budget of \u20b980 million (US$1.2\u00a0million), Kahaani was conceived and developed by Ghosh, who co-wrote the film with Advaita Kala. The crew often employed guerrilla-filmmaking techniques on Kolkata's city streets to avoid attracting attention. The film was noted for its deft portrayal of the city and for making use of many local crew and cast members. Kahaani explores themes of feminism and motherhood in male-dominated Indian society. The film also makes several allusions to Satyajit Ray's films such as Charulata (1964) and Aranyer Dinratri (1970). Kahaani was released worldwide on 9 March 2012. Critics praised the screenplay, the cinematography and the performances of the lead actors. Following critical acclaim and word-of-mouth publicity, the film earned \u20b91.04 billion (US$16\u00a0million) worldwide in 50 days. The film won several awards, including three National Film Awards and five Filmfare Awards. The latter included trophies for Best Director (Ghosh) and Best Actress (Vidya). A sequel, titled Kahaani 2: Durga Rani Singh, was released on 2 December 2016.   A poison-gas attack on a Kolkata Metro Rail compartment kills the passengers on board. Two years later Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan), a pregnant software engineer, arrives in Kolkata from London during the Durga Puja festivities in search of her missing husband, Arnab Bagchi. A police officer, Satyoki \"Rana\" Sinha (Parambrata Chatterjee), offers to help. Although Vidya claims that Arnab went to Kolkata on an assignment for the National Data Center (NDC), initial investigations suggest that no such person was employed by the NDC. Agnes D'Mello, the NDC's head of human resources, suggests to Vidya that her husband resembled former employee Milan Damji (Indraneil Sengupta), whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help she is killed by Bob Biswas (Saswata Chatterjee), an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent. Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have attracted the attention of two Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials in Delhi\u2014the chief Bhaskaran K. (Dhritiman Chatterjee) and his deputy Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison-gas attack. In spite of Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble. The address on Damji's record leads Vidya and Rana to a dilapidated flat. An errand boy from the neighbourhood tea stall identifies R. Sridhar (Shantilal Mukherjee), an NDC officer, as a frequent visitor to Damji's flat. Bob attempts to kill Vidya, but fails, and is run over by a car during a chase. Examination of Bob's mobile phone leads Vidya and Rana to an IP address sending instructions to kill her. They break into Sridhar's office to verify his IP address, but he is alerted electronically and returns to his office. Vidya accidentally shoots Sridhar dead during a scuffle, which upsets Khan, who had wanted him alive. Sridhar's computer data reveals a code, which when deciphered reveals Bhaskaran's phone number. Vidya calls Bhaskaran to tell him that she has retrieved sensitive documents from Sridhar's office. She asks Bhaskaran to help find her husband in exchange for the documents, but Bhaskaran tells her to contact the local police. Vidya soon gets a call from an unknown number however, warning her that she should hand over the documents to the caller if she wishes to see her husband alive. Khan thinks the caller is Milan Damji. Vidya goes to meet Damji, followed by Rana and Khan. Damji cuts the meeting short when Vidya expresses her doubt that he will be able to return her husband in exchange for the sensitive file, and he attempts to leave. Vidya tries to stop him, and in the ensuing struggle Damji draws a gun on her. Vidya disarms him using the prosthetic belly she has been using to fake her pregnancy and promptly stabbing him in the neck with her hair stick, before shooting him with his own gun. She flees into the crowd before the police arrive, leaving a thank you note for Rana and a pen drive containing data from Sridhar's computer, which leads to Bhaskaran's arrest. Rana concludes that no Vidya or Arnab Bagchi ever existed, and that Vidya had been using the police and the IB to achieve her own ends. Vidya is revealed to be the widow of Arup Basu (Abir Chatterjee), an IB officer and Damji's colleague, who was killed in the poison-gas attack, which also caused Vidya to immediately fall unconscious upon seeing her husband's corpse and suffer a miscarriage. In her mission to avenge his and their unborn child's death, Vidya was helped by retired IB officer Pratap Bajpayee (Darshan Jariwala), who suspected the involvement of a top IB official. Sujoy Ghosh approached novelist and script writer Advaita Kala with the idea for the film. Kala took inspiration from her experience in Kolkata, where she had moved in 1999, akin to the protagonist in the film. She reported that despite facing a language barrier and the chaos and poverty of the metropolis, she was charmed by the warmth of the people, which was reflected in the film. Kala started writing in 2009 and finished the 185-page script by February 2010. Her research included reading the books Open Secrets: India's Intelligence Unveiled by Maloy Krishna Dhar and India's External Intelligence: Secrets of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) by V. K. Singh. Ghosh, who co-wrote the story and the screenplay, began to plan the film while awaiting the release of his previous film Aladin (2009), but the dismal response to Aladin was a setback. He had to approach several producers to finance him for Kahaani, but was refused and discouraged from making the film owing to three factors: a pregnant woman as the lead star, a bunch of unknown Bengali actors as the supporting cast and Kolkata as a backdrop. Yashraj Films were willing to produce the film, but wanted Ghosh to sign a three-film deal, which he declined because he did not want that much commitment. Bengali film actor Prosenjit Chatterjee encouraged Ghosh to shoot in Kolkata. Ghosh finally selected Kolkata for several reasons: the director's acquaintance with the city, its mix of modernity and old-world charm, and budget constraints. Kolkata is a cheaper location than Mumbai or Delhi, where most Bollywood films are shot. Ghosh admitted in an interview that after his two preceding directorial ventures\u2014Aladin and Home Delivery (2005)\u2014performed poorly at the box office, Kahaani was his last chance to create a niche as a director. He added that the film's plot twist came somewhat accidentally. Having described the skeleton of the story to a friend during its development, the friend called him back a few days later to enquire about his film. The friend had mistakenly imagined sequences which he assumed to be parts of the plot, from which the twist ending was derived. Vidya Balan was the first choice of both writer Advaita Kala and director Sujoy Ghosh. Ghosh had planned for a long time to work with Vidya and approached her in 2010. Unimpressed with the plot outline, Vidya refused, only changing her mind after having read the completed script. Ghosh chose mostly Bengali actors as he wanted to make the characters as authentic as possible. The role of the Inspector Satyoki \"Rana\" Sinha was first offered to Chandan Roy Sanyal, but he could not take the part due to other commitments. Parambrata Chatterjee, a Bengali actor whose acting in the film The Bong Connection (2006) had impressed Ghosh at the Mumbai Academy of the Moving Image festival, was later offered the role in Kahaani. Chatterjee had earlier worked with Vidya in her d\u00e9but film Bhalo Theko (2003). The casting director Roshmi Banerjee suggested Nawazuddin Siddiqui for the role of Khan. Siddiqui, who had only had minor roles in Bollywood up to that time, was surprised that for the first time he would not have to portray a beggar. Saswata Chatterjee, another Bengali actor, was surprised as well when he was offered the role of the contract killer Bob Biswas. He thought there were suitable actors in Hindi film industry for the role. He said that Ghosh had known him since childhood and was impressed with his acting, so he wanted him as Bob Biswas. Ghosh went against the expectations of casting a popular actor from Bollywood. He signed Bengali actor Abir Chatterjee to play Vidya's husband. According to Ghosh, popular Bollywood actors were not willing to work with him after his two previous flops. He also believed that audience might expect more screen-time from a better-known actor. Several other Bengali film and television actors, such as Indraneil Sengupta and Kharaj Mukherjee, were cast in supporting roles. Before the shooting of the film began, Vidya started to use a prosthetic belly to look as close to authentically pregnant as possible. According to news reports, she met doctors and pregnant women to learn about the typical lifestyle and nuances of a pregnant woman, and also made lists of rules and superstitions followed by pregnant women. Vidya said that during her college days she often used to imitate pregnant ladies during stand-up acting among friends, an experience that helped her during the shooting. While briefing Saswata Chatterjee about his character, the cold-blooded killer Bob Biswas, Ghosh used the phrase \"Binito Bob\" (meaning polite Bob), which crystallised the notion of Bob's manners. Further discussions led to the inclusion of paunch and a bald patch. Chatterjee devised the mannerism of rubbing his nails together as some Indians believe doing that helps prevent hair loss. The mannerism was well-noted and praised by the viewers. Ghosh was surprised at how Bob Biswas was greeted by fans as a cult figure. He emphasised that the deliberate ordinariness of Bob Biswas was portrayed so convincingly by Chatterjee that the viewers can expect Bob to be around them at any time and any place. Parambrata Chatterjee said in an interview that he did not identify with the Rana character, owing to the difference between his own urban upbringing and Rana's rural background. Chatterjee visited police stations and did some research \"on their work, mindset and other relevant things\" to prepare for the role. The character Khan was envisaged as a ruthless, arrogant, expletive-spewing officer who cares nothing about the emotional or social consequences of his behaviour. Siddiqui said that he was surprised on being offered the role, and wondered how he could portray the arrogance needed for the character. Ghosh built Khan as a character with lean physical build but full of mental strength, loyalty and patriotism. Khan smokes a relatively cheap brand of cigarette (Gold Flake) despite his high official post; Siddiqui had smoked that brand of cigarette throughout his struggling days in Bollywood and thereafter. Filming took place on the streets of Kolkata, where Ghosh often employed the art of guerrilla filmmaking (shooting in real locations without any previous knowledge given to onlookers) to avoid unwanted attention. The cinematographer Setu, who had assisted others in the past to shoot documentaries in Kolkata, said that unlike majority of Indian films, Kahaani was shot mostly without artificial light. The film was shot in 64 days, during which the Durga Puja festival of 2010 took place. Shooting locations in Kolkata included Kalighat Metro station, Nonapukur tram depot,[a] Kumartuli, Howrah Bridge, Victoria Memorial, old houses of North Kolkata and others. The climax, which takes place on the night of Vijayadashami (the last day of Durga Puja), was shot on the night of Vijayadashami in the premises of a Barowari (publicly organised) Durga Puja celebration in the Ballygunge neighbourhood of Kolkata. Most of the crowd in the climax were not actors. Some actors mingled with the crowd engaged in Sindoor khela[b]\u2014their job was to appreciate the camera angles and accordingly apply sindoor (vermilion) on Vidya's face so that accidental exposure of her eyes to sindoor could be avoided. Ghosh chose the guest house in which the protagonist stays after noticing it during his visit to a neighbouring hotel in April 2010. He booked it for 10 days for \u20b940,000 (US$620), and requested the guest-house employees to keep the shooting schedule a secret. Choosing a room with windows overlooking a busy road, he proceeded to give it an old-fashioned look by replacing the windows' designer grilles with old-fashioned wooden ones, and by painting the room with some rough patches. After Ishqiya (2010), No One Killed Jessica (2011) and The Dirty Picture (2011), Kahaani was Vidya's fourth woman-centric film to win widespread praise for her unconventional approach to portraying strong female roles. According to Zee News, Kahaani is a woman's film about \"role reversals, breaking of stereotypes, turning clich\u00e9s inside out, a woman's journey, and the way she carves a niche for herself in the male-dominated mentalscape of the society.\" Trisha Gupta of The Indian Express also finds feminist themes in the film. For Ghosh, one aspect of his project \"is a study of motherhood\"; the instinct of a mother to protect her baby inspired him to develop the story. A recurring theme is the fleeting hint of romance between Rana and Vidya. Ghosh said that this delicate romance was \"the most progressive thing\" in the film\u2014a suggestion that a man could fall in love with a pregnant woman. The director explained that the boy was initially \"fascinated by someone who is literally a hero in his eyes\", as Rana was awed by the computer skills of Vidya. Gradually, the fascinated boy moves into a zone where he tries to protect her. Some reviewers note that a major protagonist is Kolkata itself, which is \"brimming with warm, sympathetic inhabitants\". A review in Rediff.com notes that the director pays a \"fond yet understated tribute\" to the city by incorporating imagery such as \"yellow taxis, leisurely trams, congested traffic, claustrophobic metros, dilapidated brick houses, tapering alleys, rajnigandhas,[c] lal paad saris,[d] piping hot luchis\".[e] According to the reviewer, Kahaani did not depend on the tropes of Kolkata culture typically used in Bollywood film\u2014\"O-emphasizing accent, dramatic play of conch shells, rasgulla/mishti doi excesses.\" The director acknowledges that Kolkata \"becomes a central character\" of the film. Gautaman Bhaskaran, writing for Gulf Times, notes that Kolkata imagery was polished up in the film; noted Bengali director Srijit Mukherji argues that the portrayal of the city in Kahaani was akin to a \"Lonely Planet exotica\" on the city. Uddalak Mukherjee of The Telegraph explains that Kolkata in Kahaani was cosmetic and lacked a deep menacing presence. Mukherjee argues the depiction of the city never matches the level of Satyajit Ray's Calcutta trilogy, where \"aided by bloodshed, greed and decadence,\u00a0...Calcutta\u00a0..., even though a place of dreams, desires and hope, slides irreversibly into chaos, anxiety and a moral crisis, taking its residents with it\". Durga Puja, the autumnal festival to worship goddess Durga, plays a prominent role in the story. The allegorical yearly return of goddess Durga to slay the demon Mahishasura is alluded to at the end of the film. According to Uddalak Mukherjee of The Telegraph, \"Durga Puja, with its paraphernalia of idols, immersion processions, pandals, even an entire crowd of women draped in white saris with red borders, is central to the film's\u00a0... visual aesthetic.\" A review in Rediff.com praised the depiction of the festivities in Kolkata, a city well known for its celebration of Durga Puja. Ghosh acknowledges the allusions to Ray's films. In one scene, Vidya asks the manager of the guest house why there is no hot water although the signboard had claimed \"running hot water\". The manager explains that the sign refers for his errand boy, who runs to deliver hot water in a kettle whenever required. This alludes to a similar scene in Ray's Joi Baba Felunath (1979). In an interview with The Telegraph, Ghosh says that the way Vidya looks out and moves from window to window in the guest-house room is reminiscent of Ray's Charulata (1964), where the actress Madhabi Mukherjee enjoys glimpses of the outside world through the blinds of windows. He also acknowledges the influence of Mahanagar (1963), another Ray film noted for its portrayal of Kolkata. According to the director, he was inspired by particular scenes of Ray's Nayak (1966) to plan the portrayal of complex emotional issues between Vidya and the police officer Rana, especially Rana's awe in the presence of Vidya. Ghosh expresses his inspiration from Ray's Aranyer Dinratri (1970) in which Ray \"wanted the audience to be inside the car with the four guys all the time. So the camera never leaves the car.\" Ghosh shot a similar scene, hoping the audience would become \"like Vidya's fellow passenger.\" Besides Ray's films, Ghosh also admits inspiration from what he calls \"visually striking\" films of the 1970s and 1980s, such as Deewaar (1975). Critics have compared the fake-pregnancy twist of Kahaani with the 2004 American psychological thriller Taking Lives. The sequences towards the end that explain the missing pieces of the mystery were compared with The Usual Suspects (1995). Ghosh writes that the film was heavily influenced by the colour scheme of the Pratima Visarjan, a c.1915 watercolour by the Bengal School artist Gaganendranath Tagore. The musical score was composed by Vishal\u2013Shekhar, and the lyrics for the film's six songs were written by Vishal Dadlani, Anvita Dutt and Sandeep Srivastava. Several of R. D. Burman's Hindi and Bengali compositions were used in the background. An album of the music was released on 22 February 2012 and subsequently on the digital music platform Apple iTunes India since its inception from mid-2012. The soundtrack received positive reviews, and was praised for its amalgamation of Bengali and Hindi lyrics. A review in CNN-IBN states that the song \"Ami Shotti Bolchi\" is able to partially convey the feel of Kolkata, and that the soundtrack \"features right voices with the overall mood of the album\". Mumbai Mirror rated the album with 3 stars out of 5. Reviewing the soundtrack for Indiatimes, Anand Vaishnav commented that \"Kahaani, as an album, stays honest to the theme of the film\". All lyrics written by Vishal Dadlani, Anvita Dutt and Sandeep Srivastava, except where noted. Kahaani's first-look poster was launched on 2 December 2011, and the official trailer on 5 January 2012. The poster, portraying a pregnant Vidya Balan and lacking any romantic element, was well received. Critics' expectations were low, owing to the director's previous box-office failures. Vidya appeared in public with a prosthetic belly to promote the film, and mingled with the public in railway stations, bus stands and markets. She often carried a sketch of her on-screen missing husband, and asked people to help in finding him. Social-networking website Ibibo.com developed an online game, The Great Indian Parking Wars, which required players to park Vidya's taxi on a street; it was well-received, reaching 50,000 hits in 10 days. On 5 March 2012, prior to release, Kolkata Metro authorities objected to a scene in which Vidya is pushed by a man onto the tracks as a train arrives. They requested that the scene be removed, as it would remind people of the past suicides, which had tarnished the railway's image. The filmmakers screened the scene for the authorities and explained that nothing in the film would affect the image of the Metro or prompt people to commit suicide. Convinced, the officials withdrew their objections, and the scene was retained, although it was removed from trailers. Kahaani was released on 9 March 2012, a day after International Women's Day. It played on 1100 screens worldwide. CNN-IBN reported that although Kahaani was ready before The Dirty Picture, distributors deferred its release, fearing that Vidya's role of a sexy siren (in The Dirty Picture) after that of a pregnant woman might not be received well. STAR TV bought the exclusive right to broadcast the film for a price of \u20b980 million (US$1.2\u00a0million), which was the highest-ever price paid for a female-centric film in India. The Indian television premiere of the film was on Star India's channel Movies OK on 3 June 2012. The DVD of the film was released on 17 May 2012 across all regions in a one-disc pack in NTSC format. Distributed by Shemaroo Entertainment, it contained additional content, such as behind-the-scene footage, video of celebration parties after its theatrical release, and music videos of the songs of the film. The VCD and Blu-ray versions were released at the same time. Kahaani garnered generally positive reviews from critics. According to review aggregator Review Gang the film received a rating of 7.5 out of 10, based on the reviews by professional critics. Good word of mouth publicity played a part in its popularity besides the positive reviews. The Telegraph called the film \"a mind-juggling medley of manipulation masquerading as a 'mother of a story'\". Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, and praised Vidya's acting. The Times of India commented \"Once again, a 'pregnant' Vidya, ironically displays more 'male ornaments'\u00a0... than most heroes.\" The reviews in Rediff, Indo Asian News Service, CNN-IBN, Zee News, Hindustan Times, and The Hindu were unanimously positive, and noted script, direction, cinematography, and acting as strong points of the film. Noted film actress and multiple National Award winner Shabana Azmi lauded Vidya for her performance,\"As an actor, I could see she [Vidya] was making all the right moves throughout the film. There was not a single artificial note in her performance.\" Russell Edwards, the reviewer for Variety, praised the cast, cinematography, and direction, and commented that despite occasional glitches, the \"adroit thriller\u00a0... maintains momentum and credibility.\" Many reviewers criticised the film's climax and certain features, feeling that they deviated from its general style. Rituparna Chatterjee of CNN-IBN noted that the climax of the film was a \"huge dampener\" and explained, \"The diabolic twist at that juncture got underplayed\u00a0... What follows is a sobfest\u00a0... the apologetic explanation of why she does what she does. Justifying her action comes across more as an effort to appease the Indian morality\". The Outlook review noted, \"At times, Kahaani is too clever, at others extremely pedestrian like in the depiction of computer hacking and IB operations, not to speak of the ludicrous terrorist angle and the all-too predictable Durga Puja setting for that mythology tie-in.\" It adds that the \"spoon-feeding\" of reasons at the end dampens the intrigue factor. The review in Yahoo! India comments that the Durga metaphor at the end was enforced, and that the film over-indulged in Bengali stereotypes. Gautaman Bhaskaran, in his review in Gulf Times, noted that the sometimes-handheld photography was \"as irksome as the plot with a sleuth too many and cops galore.\" Though Kahaani received critical acclaim, it was a slow starter at the box office, opening to a poor response on the first day, but gradually picking afterwards. According to The Telegraph, the film earned almost \u20b920 million (US$310,000) from the state of West Bengal within the first three days of its release. At multiplexes in Kolkata, occupancy increased from 47% on Friday 9 March, the day of release, to 77% on 10 March and to around 97% on 11 March. Box Office India, a website on Indian film trade, reported that the film collected nearly \u20b9240 million (US$3.7\u00a0million) in its first week, well beyond its production cost of \u20b980 million (US$1.2\u00a0million). It grossed \u20b9190 million (US$2.9\u00a0million) in second week to make a two-week total of around \u20b9430 million (US$6.7\u00a0million) in India; this led Box Office India to declare the film a \"Super Hit\". The film was successful in the international box office as well, garnering \u20b980 million (US$1.2\u00a0million) within 10 days of its release in seven markets\u2014UK, US, UAE, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Pakistan, according to Bollywood Hungama, a film-related website. By the third week, according to CNN-IBN, it had grossed \u20b9750 million (US$12\u00a0million), including India and overseas market. Hindustan Times reported that Kahaani made a worldwide gross of \u20b91,044.3 million (US$16\u00a0million) within 50 days of its release. Kahaani was nominated for, and won, many awards. The 58th Filmfare Awards nominated the film for six of their categories, where it won five, including Best Actress for Vidya and Best Director for Ghosh. Kahaani received thirteen nominations at the 19th\u00a0Colors Screen Awards, and won five, including Best Actress and Best Story. At the 14th Zee Cine Awards, Kahaani won five awards, including Best Film (Critics) and Best Actress (Critics), out of fifteen nominations. At the 2013 Stardust Awards ceremony, Kahaani was announced Hottest Film of the Year while Vidya received for the Best Actress in a Thriller or Action. Kahaani was awarded the Most Entertaining Film of the Year at the 3rd ceremony of the BIG Star Entertainment Awards. At the 60th National Film Awards, Ghosh won Best Screenplay (Original), Namrata Rao won Best Editing, and Nawazuddin Siddiqui won a Special Jury award. Following Kahaani's success, Kolkata became a preferred destination for Bollywood filmmakers. They felt the landscapes of Mumbai and Delhi were overused for several decades, while Kolkata retained its unique visuals such as metro trains, rickety trams, hand-pulled rickshaws, dingy bylanes, palatial mansions, dilapidated houses of North Kolkata, roadside eateries, ghats of river Ganga, British-era buildings, restaurants and iconic structures and areas including Howrah Bridge, Kalighat Temple, Nakhoda Mosque, Kumortuli idol-making district and Victoria Memorial. Monalisa Guest House, the lodge which hosted Vidya Bagchi in the film, became a local attraction. Several hundreds have visited it since the film's release, to the extent that the owners planned to increase tariffs and renovate the rooms around a Kahaani theme. The potbellied contract killer Bob Biswas became an Internet phenomenon, the subject of several jokes and pieces of pop art, which circulated through Facebook and Twitter. \"Nomoshkar, Aami Bob Biswas... Ek minute?\" (\"Hello, I am Bob Biswas... do you have a minute?\")\u2014the monologue he repeatedly uses just before murdering his victims\u2014was used in different memes. A graphic novel and a television show based on Bob Biswas were being planned, as of March 2012[update]. Two remakes of Kahaani were released in 2014: a Telugu remake titled Anaamika, and its Tamil version Nee Enge En Anbe, both directed by Sekhar Kammula and featuring Nayantara as the lead character. An English-language remake, entitled Deity, will be directed by the Danish director Niels Arden Oplev and produced by Yashraj Films, with production scheduled to begin in 2015. In March 2012, Sujoy Ghosh announced that he intended to develop Kahaani into a series. He was inspired by Satyajit Ray's Feluda detective series and wanted to continue the stories of Vidya Bagchi on similar lines, with Vidya Balan reprising the role. The shooting of Kahaani 2 was scheduled to begin in 2013, but in July 2013 differences arose between Sujoy Ghosh and other co-producers. In February 2014, Vidya announced that the sequel was not happening due to these differences, but two years later, Ghosh confirmed that the film was in pre-production with Vidya set to reprise her role. The sequel, entitled Kahaani 2, began filming in March 2016 with Vidya and Arjun Rampal in lead roles, and was released on 2 December 2016.",

It was noted for having several of Bollywood's stars in a cameo at the film premiere of Mother India (1957), and it was also the only film to star the three Anand brothers together. It became a semi-hit at the box office.   Raghuvir (Dev Anand) is a poor bus conductor who is fired from the job after getting into an argument with a passenger. With an ailing mother (Leela Chitnis) and two younger siblings to take care of, Raghu doesn't know how to provide for his family. When he passes by a cinema hall and sees Kalu (Rashid Khan) selling movie tickets, he gets an idea. Raghu steals \u20b9 5000 from Advocate Desai (Chetan Anand) and sets up his own black marketing business.

Finally, he sells his last ticket for \u20b9 100 when one ticket cost only \u20b9 2. Elated with his newfound business, Raghu and Kalu go from strength to strength, recruiting many poor and homeless thieves. When Ganesh (Madan Puri) dares to challenge him, Raghu beats him up. The next day, Ganesh agrees to work for Raghu. Now a wealthy man, Raghu buys a new, spacious flat for his family in Marine Drive. Things change when a group of students buy movie tickets from him. Alka (Waheeda Rehman) finds out that her friends bought them in black, and tears the tickets. This has a great impact on Raghu, who is standing nearby and watching. Her boyfriend, Nandkumar Chattopadhyay (Vijay Anand) promises her not to do it again. Smitten with Alka, Raghu starts to follow her. When Nand gets a scholarship and travels overseas, Alka's parents decide to take her to Ooty to take her mind off Nand. Raghu sees this as a perfect opportunity and gets on the same cabin as her family. He sings \"Apni To Har Aah Ek Toofan Hai\", trying to flirt with Alka, while the song itself was veiled as a prayer. He also helps to cure Alka's father's back pain with a massage, and soon, he becomes friends with the family. All that taken care of, he sets out to romance Alka, but she resists and turns away his love when she lies that she is engaged to Nand. Heartbroken, Raghu returns to Bombay to continue his business, but his love for Alka has changed him. When he left Alka in Ooty, he promised that he would never do anything bad. Raghu tries to convince his partners to stop black marketing and get an honest job, but they all eventually go back to their bad deeds. Raghu continues to try and earn an honest living, and to his surprise, he meets Alka one day in Bombay. Alka, meanwhile, also falls for Raghu, but hesitates to tell him. Finally, she writes a letter to Nand, telling him to forget her because she loves Raghu. The latter is delighted, and Alka tells him to come in the evening to talk to her parents. However, everything goes awry when she learns that Nand has returned. When Nand comes to her house, the two of them argue, but finally both concede that their \"love\" was just childishness. Now free to profess her love for Raghu, Alka goes to his house, only to learn that he has been arrested for black marketing...

Twenty years later, an elderly Naina recalls how Aman impacted their lives as she sits beside a grown-up Gia. They are joined by an aged Rohit, who reminds Naina that he loves her, and the couple's teenage daughter Ria. The film was written by Karan Johar with dialogue by Niranjan Iyengar and directed by debutant director Nikhil Advani. It was the last film to be produced by Yash Johar before his death on 26 June 2004. The choreography was by Farah Khan. Manish Malhotra designed the costumes of the three lead actors. Pre-production of the film began in December 2002. Kareena Kapoor was initially the first choice for Naina, but due to differences over her fees, she refused the role. Preity Zinta was the immediate next choice. Salman Khan was considered for the role of Rohit as Johar had previously worked with him and Shah Rukh in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. However, Salman declined the offer. Kajol was also considered for a leading role in the film, but this idea was quickly halted due to her pregnancy at the time of filming. Karan Johar insisted that she at least make a special appearance, which she did in the song \"Maahi Ve.\"  Shooting began in January 2003 in New York City. A major portion of the movie was shot in Toronto due to high production costs in New York City. The soundtrack of the film was released on 27 September 2003 by Sony Music at Mumbai's Taj Lands End's banquet hall, Salcette in various formats and consists of seven tracks. The music is conducted by award-winning trio Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, with lyrics authored by Javed Akhtar. The music went on to do extremely well at the charts, and became the most successful music album of the year. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy won their first Filmfare Best Music Director Award for this soundtrack, as well as the National Film Award for Best Music Direction. Unlike with many other Hindi productions, the film's makers also complied with international copyright laws and obtained the license to use Roy Orbison's \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" for an extended musical sequence taking place in the streets in New York. After its release, the album was met with high critical and commercial success, with sales of over 2.3 million copies. It was the highest-selling album that year. The title song was featured in Outlook's list of Bollywood's Timeless Melodies, making it the only contemporary selection on the list. The soundtrack was also listed in the top five of BBC Asian Network's Top 40 Soundtracks of all time. Karan Johar decided to end the association with the composer duo Jatin-Lalit since they publicly stated that they were upset with his decision to use other music directors for Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. This marked the beginning of the collaboration of Shankar Ehsaan Loy with Karan Johar, which continues to date. The theme of the title song \"Kal Ho Naa Ho\" was composed by Loy, and Shankar arranged the groove. The song \"Pretty Woman\" by Roy Orbison was licensed and used in the film. The film was released in India on 28 November 2003. Kal Ho Naa Ho is the second Bollywood film to attain wide release in Germany in early 2005 (the first was Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham). Since then, Bollywood movies have become increasingly popular in Germany, and other Indian films have been shown on prime time television and have sold well on DVD. This movie was released in Poland in May 2006 as Gdyby Jutra Nie By\u0142o (If Tomorrow Never Comes) and in France in 2005 as New-York Masala. Kal Ho Naa Ho was positively received by critics worldwide. Taran Adarsh gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and said: \"Yes, Kal Ho Naa Ho does live up to the expectations. Yes, the SRK-Karan Johar magic does cast a spell the third time around. The film works, courtesy SRK's incredible performance and Karan's deft writing.\" Archana Vohra from NDTV gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, stating, \"Advani ... seems to have come up with an innovative way to present a done-to-death plot,\" later adding that \"irrespective of the frills, fancy clothes and well-dressed stars, the film does strike a chord and is a brilliant debut by Nikhil Advani.\" Rediff.com, in a positive review, wrote, \"The film is fresh in treatment and storytelling. Shah Rukh excels as the supercool Aman. You understand why it is difficult for Karan to work with any other actor, because SRK steals the show with a designer-made role. Given SRK's performance, it is all the more important to take note of Saif, whose Rohit Patel will be remembered just as much as his Sameer in Dil Chahta Hai. Saif is first-rate, and your heart goes out to this under-rated actor. Preity Zinta slips into character beautifully. Right from the preppy spectacles to her no-nonsense demeanor, Preity captures the spirit of Naina Kapur. She has never looked so pretty. Kal Ho Naa Ho will carry you with its exuberance.\" Mayank Shekhar in his review for Mid-Day gave it 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Yes, this is soft-focus, sweet background score, life is simplistic escapist cinema. But the bottom line: at the end of the day, it works and is worth your entertainment bucks. And that's saying a lot.\" In a positive review, Dave Kehr from The New York Times concluded, \"This is a rich meal that may best be reserved for stomachs accustomed to such bountiful fare.\" Komal Nahta from Outlook, in a 4-star review, remarked, \"[writer] Johar has packaged the drama so very contemporarily that the final product holds its own. Undoubtedly, [the film] is one of the cleverest love triangles in Hindi cinema.\" Ziya Us Salam wrote for The Hindu, \"Watch Kal Ho Naa Ho. It is like life. It gives you reason to be disappointed, just as it gives you reason to hope.\" In a four-star review, Jitesh Pillai of Filmfare wrote, \"Anyone (which means almost everyone) who has loved and lost will recognize that Kal Ho Naa Ho is a bittersweet valentine to unrequited love. Nikhil Advani makes the sensational debut that other directors only dream of.\" Anupama Chopra, in a positive review, wrote, \"Advani, who learned family film formula with masters Aditya Chopra and Karan Johar, emerges as a distinctive voice with his first film. Written by Johar, the film revisits old ground-NRIs, wedding song, snazzy club number and Shah Rukh-but also evolves the formula. It has technical pizzazz (split screens, in-camera dialogue) and an urbane wit despite snags like sub-plots with pat endings or a lame pre-interval portion. The dialogue by Niranjan Iyengar is perfectly pitched and the performances uniformly good.\" Chopra included the film in her list of \"Top Ten Movies of The Year\", ranked fifth. Ram Kamal Mukherjee from Stardust praised the film's performances, technical aspects and its entertainment value, but noted several flaws in its \"logistic part\". Rama Sharma from The Tribune concluded, \"Kal Ho Na Ho is a usual filmi love web with a cosmopolitan appeal and a lot of comedy packed in the first half.\" Jami Bernard from New York Daily News wrote, \"Bollywood musicals, those big, loud, colorful extravaganzas from India, are an acquired taste and much of \"Kal Ho Naa Ho\" doesn't translate easily,\" though he further noted, \"All three leads grow on you.\" Kal Ho Naa Ho grossed \u20b958.18 crore (US$9.0\u00a0million) in India and $6.1 million (\u20b927.90 crore) in other countries, for a worldwide total of \u20b986.08 crore (US$13\u00a0million), against its \u20b928 crore (US$4.3\u00a0million) budget.

        "full_text": " Kalyug is a 1981 Indian Hindi-language crime drama film, directed by Shyam Benegal. It is known as a modern-day version of the Indian epic Mahabharat depicted as an archetypal conflict between rival business houses. Kalyug went on to win the Filmfare Award for Best Film in 1982. The screenplay and plot are quite different from Mahabharat. However, the characterization and the critical events had a striking similarity with the epic. Shashi Kapoor, Rekha, Raj Babbar, Supriya Pathak, Anant Nag, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Sushma Seth, Akash Khurana, Victor Bannerjee, Reema Lagoo, and A.K. Hangal played major roles, while Urmila Matondkar appeared as a child artist.   This is a tale of intrigue, plots and the inevitable war between two families. Ramchand and Bhishamchand were two pioneering brothers in business. Bhishamchand, a lifelong bachelor, brought up the two sons of Ramchand upon his demise. He also gave the family business a firm foundation. Khubchand (Vinod Doshi), the elder son of Ramchand begets two sons, Dhanraj (Victor Banerjee) and Sandeepraj (Akash Khurana). Puranchand, Khubchand's younger brother, had died a few years ago. His three sons are Dharamraj (Raj Babbar), Balraj (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) and Bharatraj (Anant Nag). Another player in the game is Karan (Shashi Kapoor), an orphan brought up by Bhishamchand. A series of events brings the long-hidden feud between the two families to light. Despite Bhishamchand's efforts to mediate between the two, the situation gets out of hand and events take a tragic turn. Dhanraj's men accidentally kill the young son of Balraj and to take revenge Bharatraj murders Karan. Quite a few skeletons from the family cupboard are brought into the open that only adds to the tensions and hatred, finally culminating in the destruction of the two families, showing the brittleness of our moral fabric. Anil Dharker, writing for International Film Guide, wrote a positive review, calling it \"ambitious\" and noting it as \"the most complex of Benegal's films so far\", which is \"carefully paced\" and \"expertly put together\". Dharker praised the cinematographic work and the acting: \"Govind Nihalani, Benegal's regular cameraman, highlights each shifting mood with skilful lighting. The cast, most of it Benegal regulars, is excellent, with virtuoso performances from Victor Banerjee, and Shashi Kapoor...\" Kalyug was entered into the 12th Moscow International Film Festival.",

The film was directed by Rakesh Roshan and written by Ravi Kapoor and Sachin Bhowmick. Karan Arjun is a mix of an upbeat Bollywood musical, religious overtones and an action movie. The film was the second highest grossing Hindi film of 1995 after Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge which also starred Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol.   Durga Singh (Raakhee) is a poor woman raising her two beloved sons Karan Singh (Salman Khan), the elder and Arjun Singh (Shah Rukh Khan), the younger. When Munim of an aging Thakur comes to talk to Durga, Karan and Arjun learn that their father is dead. Durga reveals that their father was the Thakur's son, who had married her against his father's wishes. Durjan Singh (Amrish Puri), a relative of Thakur, killed Durga's husband to prevent him, Durga, or their sons from inheriting the Thakur's estate. Karan and Arjun learn from her that the dying Thakur wants to give his estate to his grandchildren before dying as it is their birthright. Durjan kills Thakur revealing to him that he did kill his son all those years ago and when he learns of his plans to sign over the estate to Karan and Arjun. He then brutally murders both Karan and Arjun by ambushing them with the help of his brothers-in law Nahar (Arjun) and Shamsher (Jack Gaud) in front of Durga. Durga cannot accept that her sons have died and prays to Goddess Kali to bring them back. Miraculously, Durga's prayers are heard and her sons are reborn but into different families with no knowledge of their past lives \u2013 Durga is unaware of this miracle. For 20 years she keeps persuading the people of her village that Karan and Arjun will come back. Durjan and his family mockingly give her garlands to put on the picture of Karan and Arjun. Durga vows to place the garlands over their dead bodies. Arjun is reincarnated as Vijay. He falls in love with the wealthy Sonia (Kajol), but neither knows that Sonia is to marry Durjan Singh's son, Suraj (Aashif Sheikh). Karan is reincarnated as Ajay. He soon works for Saxena (Ranjeet), Sonia's father and Durjan's partner in his illegal arms trading business. Karan and Arjun still have nightmares about their deaths in previous lives. On learning about Vijay, Suraj attempts to kill him but ends up burning the farm of Arjun's Uncle. At Sonia and Suraj's engagement party, Vijay arrives and attacks Suraj. Ajay is sent to kill Vijay and the two start fighting. Durga is given a sign of this when the photo of her sons falls. She rushes to the temple and prays to Goddess Kali. Vijay and Ajay suddenly stop fighting after a bolt of lightning strikes them. Saxena tries to shoot Vijay but Ajay stops him whilst shouting for Arjun to run. This is something that Ajay had said to Vijay in their previous births when he was being attacked by Nahar. Ajay is sent to prison while Vijay escapes. Vijay is confused about the incident, mostly because he had dreamt of somebody saying those exact words to him. Sonia is forcibly taken to Durjan's house to marry Suraj. She writes to Vijay begging him to come and rescue her. Vijay and his friend Linghaiyya (Johnny Lever) travel to save Sonia. Everybody who sees him is stunned and calls him Arjun. He finally remembers his past life and reunites with Durga where he gets to know about his brother Karan who is now Ajay. Vijay saves Ajay and explains the whole situation. Ajay refuses to believe, but when Durjan's brothers-in-law attack Durga, he remembers his previous life. Durjan hears about Karan and Arjun's return but refuses to believe it so his brothers-in-law attempt to bring them before him. In the process, they are killed by Ajay and Vijay in a similar way as they killed Karan and Arjun and Durga places the garlands over their dead bodies. At the village temple of Goddess Kali, rituals are held for Sonia and Suraj's wedding. Karan and Arjun frighten Durjan by convincing him that they are back. Soon, Saxena and Durjan have fallout, after which a fearful Saxena tells Sonia to run away with Vijay. Sonia meets Vijay, but just as everybody is helping them, Durjan and Saxena arrive, making them realize that it was a ruse. Ajay succeeds in creating a diversion, letting Vijay and Sonia escape. Vijay kills Suraj, upon which Durjan kills Saxena in a fit of rage. After all his henchmen are killed, Durjan attempts to kill Karan and Arjun. They overpower him. He runs to Durga and begs her for forgiveness. However, she orders her sons to kill him for revenge. They do so and Durga places the garland over his dead body, fulfilling the promises she made to him. Later, at Goddess Kali's temple, Arjun marries Sonia and Karan marries his love Bindiya (Mamta Kulkarni), after which Durga places the bangles her sons gave her on her daughters-in-law's wrists, as she promised Karan and Arjun 20 years ago and the family is finally reunited. The casting of film brought together Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan, two prominent actors of that time. Hrithik Roshan became an assistant director assisting his father Rakesh Roshan in his first major contribution to Bollywood. The whole film was shot in Rajasthan. More specifically the village which is portrayed in film is one of villages of Alwar District of Rajasthan, named Bhangarh. The Durga temple where Karan Arjun pray in the song is located at Pushkar near Ajmer. Ajay Devgan & Govinda (actor) was originally offered the role of Karan & Arjun but both turned them down due to scheduling conflicts. It was the second highest grossing Indian film of 1995.

In the end, Monty marries Tina. The soundtrack of the film includes tracks, composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal, and with lyrics by Anand Bakshi, who received two Filmfare nominations for these two hits, 'Om Shanti Om' and 'Dard-E-Dil', Laxmikant-Pyarelal however won the trophy for Best Music Director of the year. With hits like, \"Ek Haseena Thi \"(The popular tune was ripped off from 1978 George Benson's 'we as love') and \" Om Shanti Om \" by Kishore Kumar and \"Dard-E-Dil\" by Mohd. Rafi, the soundtrack was a trendsetter for the disco music in the Indian music industry and film's background score, especially the signature tune are still remembered as one of the most memorable ones. The film's chart-buster song, Om Shanti Om, sung by Kishore Kumar, reached the number 2 spot on the Binaca Geetmala's annual list 1980, while another duet between Lata and Kishore, Tu Kitne Baras Ki reached number 13. All lyrics written by Anand Bakshi; all music composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal. \nMeanwhile, the Filmfare Best Music Director Award notwithstanding, the film's music turned out to be heavily \"inspired\" in the later years, like the dramatic Ek Hasina Thi was taken from George Benson's As We Love, while Om Shanti Om itself came from Trinidad Calypso artist Lord Shorty's version The story of this movie about reincarnation and revenge became the ninth highest grosser of the year, and was declared a \"Semi Hit\" nationwide. In a 2008 interview, film director, Subhash Ghai admitted that film was ahead of its time, and was thus panned by critics of the times, and \"flopped\" at the box office, it was only years later that it started being considered a classic and even remade several times over. The film is also one of the finest films of Subhash Ghai, notable for picturisation of songs like Ek Hasina Thi on stage as well as Dard-E-Dil, and set the standard for his future films, as most of them became known for his dramatic flair, and above all their music score. However, the director Subhash Ghai admitted that Karz was partly inspired by the 1975 American film The Reincarnation of Peter Proud, mixed in with Indian beliefs on reincarnation. Karz may have also been inspired by the 1958 Hindi film Madhumati. Karz was itself remade several times: as the Kannada film Yuga Purusha (1989), the Tamil film Enakkul Oruvan (1984), and more recently the Hindi film Karzzzz (2008). Karz may have also inspired the American film Chances Are (1989). Though the theme of reincarnation was earlier handled in Madhumati (1958), Kudrat (1981), and Mehbooba (1976), the modern twist with murder and revenge angle set in Karz was a pot-boiler; it went on to inspire several other Indian remakes, notably Yuga Purusha (1989) in Kannada, Enakkul Oruvan (1984) in Tamil, Atmabhalam (1985) in Telugu, and the most recent Hindi film Karzzzz (2008) starring Himesh Reshammiya. The songs of the film inspired several film titles, notably Paisa Yeh Paisa (1985), Main Solah Baras Ki (1998), Ek Hasina Thi (2004), Aashiq Banaya Aapne (2005) and Om Shanti Om (2007), which was seen as light-hearted tribute to the film, as it borrowed many elements from it.",

        "full_text": " Kashmir Ki Kali (\"Bud of Kashmir\") is a 1964 Indian film directed by Shakti Samanta. It stars Shammi Kapoor, Sharmila Tagore in her debut role, Pran, Dhumal, Nazir Hussain and Anoop Kumar. The music was composed by O.P. Nayyar and the lyrics penned by S.H. Bihari. It became the sixth-highest grossing film of the year and was declared a hit at the box office. The film was remade in Telugu as Shrungara Ramudu.   Wealthy and pampered Rajiv Lal (Shammi Kapoor) is the only son of widowed Rani Maa. At the silver jubilee anniversary of the mill that his father, the late Sanjiv Lal opened, he announces a bonus of 5 lakh rupees for all the workers, annoying his mother. A servant at the house, Karuna (Mridula Rani), suggests marrying him off to stop his immature antics, to which Rani Maa agrees. Her manager, Shyamlal, arranges for her to meet some girls, as she insists that Rajiv will marry a girl of her choice. Rajiv returns home and sees all the girls - he correctly surmises that his mother is getting him married, and he pretends to be a mute who walks with a limp in order to chase all the prospective suitors off. His plan succeeds, although he is in a dilemma as his mother is furious at him. One of his friends suggests that he should go away to their bungalow in Kashmir - after all, Rani Maa never goes there. Upon arrival in Kashmir, he finds that his estate manager, Bholaram (Dhumal), has made a hotel out of their bungalow and has rented out some rooms for the season. He tells the tenants that he is Rajiv Lal, although when he meets Bholaram, the latter informs him that Rani Maa had called him, and told him not to let Rajiv stay at the bungalow, should he come. Rajiv manages to convince Bholaram to tell Rani Maa that he is not there. Bholaram tells the tenants in the house that Rajiv is mad, and in his madness, thinks that he is the real owner of the estate. The next day, Rajiv meets Champa (Sharmila Tagore), a girl who sells flowers for a living. He buys her flowers for 20 rupees when they are priced at 5, and tells her that he is not the owner, but the driver. Soon enough, after a few misadventures, they fall in love and decide to marry, but there are a few obstacles. First of all, Mohan (Pran), the forest manager, has loaned out some money to Champa's father, Dinu (Nazir Hussain), and he insists on marrying Champa if Dinu cannot repay the debt. Things become complicated when Mohan finds out that Dinu is not Champa's real father, and he blackmails Dinu into getting Champa married to him, or else he will let out the secret to Champa. Champa still continues to meet Rajiv on the sly, but all of that comes to an end when three girls, who are tenants in his house, reveal in her presence that he is not the driver, but the owner of the estate. Feeling betrayed, Champa runs off. Before Rajiv can go after her, he receives a trunk call from his mother, and he is informed that Karuna is seriously ill. After telling Bholaram to explain everything to Champa, he leaves for Bombay, and finds Karuna on her deathbed, with Rani Maa at her side. Karuna tells Rajiv that he is not the real son of Rani Maa, and that his biological father is none other than her brother, Dinu. Many years ago, Dinu had sold him off to Karuna for alcohol, and Rani Maa had taken him in. Soon after, Rani Maa gave birth to a baby girl, but Dinu abducted her, intending to kill her so that Rajiv will be the sole heir to Rani Maa's wealth. However, on the way, Dinu tripped and fell, and loses his eyesight, so he does not kill the girl. Rajiv is shocked at the revelation, but more so is Rani Maa, who had assumed that her baby girl was still-born. Before Karuna can say who the girl is, she dies. Shyamlal informs the two that the day Karuna fell ill, a man from Kashmir had come to see her and asked about Rani Maa's girl, but Karuna hadn't told him anything. The man turns out to be Mohan. Rajiv and Rani Maa head back to Kashmir to find out who the girl is, and Rajiv, acting on a tip from Bholaram, goes to confront Mohan.

Recommended by film's lead Shammi Kapoor himself, originally duo Shankar-Jaikishan were to compose film's music, however veteran composer OP Nayyar invited Samanta to listen to some tunes, which he liked. Eventually 12 were selected for the film, and the remainder were used in Sawan Ki Ghata (1966). The film's music was composed by O.P. Nayyar, and the lyrics were penned by S.H. Bihari. Mohammed Rafi sang four solos for Shammi Kapoor, and three duets with Asha Bhosle. Most of the songs are romantic and were picturized on both Shammi Kapoor and Sharmila Tagore. Originally Shankar-Jaikishan were chosen to compose the music score for the film but when OP Nayyar made Shammi Kapoor to listen to some of his compositions he was immediately chosen as the music composer of the film.

The film stars Asha Parekh as a woman pretending to be a widow, and her ensuing trials and tribulations opposite her charming neighbour played by Rajesh Khanna. The film was an adaption of the novel of the same name by Gulshan Nanda. The film's story, also written by Nanda, was also based on the novel I Married a Dead Man, by Cornell Woolrich and had been previously made into a picture titled No Man of Her Own (1950) starring Barbara Stanwyck. The novel was also later filmed in Japanese as Shisha to no Kekkon (1960), in Brazilian as the TV miniseries A Intrusa (1962), in French as J'ai \u00e9pous\u00e9 une ombre (I Married a Shadow) (1983), and by Hollywood as Mrs. Winterbourne (1996). The film is among the 17 consecutive hits of Khanna between 1969 and 1971 and is the second of four films in which he was paired with Parekh. According to newspaper The Hindu, 'on screen, Rajesh Khanna never appeared to be lip-syncing. So convincing were his expressions. His presence, backed by the music, remained the main source of strength for a movie\u2019s success'. The movie also stars Nasir Hussain, Bindu, Prem Chopra, Daisy Irani and Sulochana Latkar. The film was the second in a string of nine movies in which Samanta and Khanna collaborated. Music was composed by R.D. Burman and was a huge hit. \"Ye shaam masthani\" and \"Pyar deewana hota hein\", sung by Kishore Kumar were particularly famous. The performance of Asha Parekh and Rajesh Khanna were praised by the audience and critics alike. The film was remade in Tamil as Nenjil Oru Mull (1981) and in Telugu as Punnami Chandrudu (1987) with Sobhan Babu.   Madhavi Madhu (Asha Parekh) is an orphan living with her maternal uncle, who arranges her marriage with someone she does not know. Blinded in love with Kailash (Prem Chopra), she runs away on the day of the marriage. She discovers Kailash in the arms of Shabnam (Bindu). Heartbroken and dejected, she returns to her uncle, who committed suicide from the humiliation. Madhavi realizes that she has no one in life, and decides to leave town and head somewhere. She meets her childhood friend Poonam who tells her about her husband's untimely demise in an accident and that she is on her way, along with her baby boy Munna, to stay with her in-laws whom she has never met before. Poonam manages to compel Madhu to accompany her as her plight is pitiful. En route, Poonam and Madhu catch up until the train derails and end up in a Government hospital. Poonam has lost her limbs. She knows that her end is near, so has Madhu promise that she will assume Poonam's identity, bring Munna up and continue life in Poonam's in-law's house. Madhu has no choice but to give in to a dying mother's wish. In the downpour on the way, the cabbie attempts to rob her until Kamal (Rajesh Khanna), a forest ranger, rescues her and gives her shelter until the skies are clear the next day. She soon learns that Kamal is the very man with whom her marriage was arranged. Madhu leaves Kamal's home in shame and reaches Poonam's in-laws. Her father-in-law, Dinanath (Nazir Hussain) and mother-in-law (Sulochana) accept her and let her stay there. Kamal keeps visiting the house as he was the son of Dinanath's best friend. Soon, he realizes that he is in love with Poonam. Madhu's ill fate has brought Kailash to Dinanath's house. He is after their money and is very close to reveal Madhu's identity. To be successful, he impresses all the members of the house but Poonam takes a resentment to him. Dinanath soon realizes Poonam's true identity and asks for the truth. When he realizes what the matter really is, he accepts Madhavi and makes her the guardian of the Dinanath property which will be inherited by Munna. That night, Dinanath is poisoned by Kailash. Mrs. Dinanath accuses Poonam for what has happened and she is imprisoned. Now Shabnam enters the life of the Dinanaths claiming that she is the real Poonam. Mrs. Dinanath, in rage, sends her away and is ready for no story. Kamal takes a dislike towards Madhu, learning the truth. However, he eventually realizes the truth and gets Shabnam and Kailash arrested for their evil intentions and Madhavi is freed. When Kamal searches for Madhu, he realizes that she has left without any notice and left a letter for Kamal, stating that she is going out of his life and so, he should not try to find out her. Kamal starts searching for her and finds her trying to jump from a cliff, stops her by singing a song. They hug. Shakti Samanta has said that he cast Asha Parekh, because he was \"confident\" that he could extract a \"convincing performance from her.\" He had cast her in his earlier film, the underrated Pagla Kahin Ka. She won the Filmfare Best Actress Award, the only win for the film. The music was composed by Rahul Dev Burman, and the lyrics were penned by Anand Bakshi. Kishore Kumar sang four songs for Rajesh Khanna, while Mukesh got to sing a number for the latter - a rare combination. Asha Bhosle performed \"Mera Naam Hai Shabnam\" in the talk-sung style of Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady (and thus often incorrectly dubbed \"the first Hindi rap number\"). The film was successful, and it became the sixth highest earning Bollywood film of 1970.",

        "full_text": " Khal Nayak (English: Villain) is a 1993 Bollywood action thriller film produced and directed by Subhash Ghai.The story centres on the escape and attempted capture of a terrorist criminal Ballu (Sanjay Dutt) by Inspector Ram (Jackie Shroff) and his girlfriend officer Ganga (Madhuri Dixit). The film was remade in Telugu as Khaidi No. 1 with Vinod Kumar playing Sanjay Dutt's role, Sukanya playing Madhuri Dixit's role and Raghuman appearing in Jackie Shroff's role.   Ballu (Sanjay Dutt) is a gangster who is arrested by Inspector Ram (Jackie Shroff). Ram shows compassion to Ballu while trying to get information that would lead to capture of Ballu's boss and mentor, Roshidahe. Ballu does not speak, and he promises to escape from the jail. Ballu escapes from jail while Ram is visiting his girlfriend, Ganga (Madhuri Dixit), who is also a police officer. When news of this breaks out, Ram's reputation is in tatters as the media portrays Ram as an officer who has neglected his duty. Ganga, in an attempt to restore Ram's reputation, goes undercover as a street-girl. Ganga realizes that Ballu is a kind-hearted person who turned to crime due to poverty and circumstances, and she tries to rehabilitate him while on the run. Meanwhile, Ballu begins to fall in love with Ganga. He becomes enraged when he finds out she doesn't love him and is a police officer. Ganga continues to help Ballu as she has seen good in him. Meanwhile, Ram approaches Ballu's mother for help and realises that Ballu is, in fact, his childhood friend. Ballu's mother and Ballu then tell Ram and Ganga, respectively, the story of how Roshida used their poverty to corrupt Ballu. Roshida killed Ballu's sister, and put the blame on the police. Ballu kills the officer he believes to be behind this and from then on spirals into a life of crime. Ganga, afraid that police will kill Ballu, stops the police from shooting him, allowing him to escape. She is hence arrested for aiding a criminal and is accused of being in a relationship with Ballu, which destroys her professional and personal reputation. Ballu's mother finds him, while she is followed by Ram. In the following confrontation Ballu's mother takes Ram's side trying to convince Ballu to give himself up. Ballu seeing Ganga's picture in Ram's wallet realizes that this is who she loves. Ballu manages to escape to Roshida's base where Roshida promises to help him escape but betrays him and attempts to kill him and his mother. The police, led by Ram, attack Roshida's lair. In the ensuing conflict Ballu finds out that Roshida killed his sister. Ram kills Roshida and Ballu escapes. Following Roshida's death, Ballu installs himself as the new boss - but his girlfriend informs him that Ganga is about to go on trial for aiding him. Having a change of heart, Ballu appears to attack the court but then surrenders himself and swears that Ganga is innocent, thereby restoring her reputation and reconciling her and Ram. Subhash Ghai had initially conceived his 1993 crime drama, as a Hollywood film, which he planned to make in association with Ashok Amritraj as a producer on the film. Ghai was developing it with a Hollywood scriptwriter. The subject revolved only around the two male leads, on his return to India Ghai was plagued with second thoughts since he had autonomous powers as a director back home, involved with every aspect of filmmaking, from writing and editing to music and performances. \"In the West, the director is just a hired technician who had to surrender to the wishes of the studio honchos, actors, the first, second and third writer and so many more,\" said Ghai. Unwilling to adapt to this work culture in a bid to make a competitive mainstream film for the global market, Ghai decided to turn the plot into a typical Hindi family-dram-cum-love story, bringing in the track of the mother and creating the character of Ganga as the cop, Ram's lady love. Madhuri Dixit had a three-film deal with Ghai's production house and she happily agreed to play Ganga,for the role of Ram, Jackie Shroff, who was almost like family to Ghai and had successfully played Ram in Ram Lakhan, whose face reflected goodness according to Ghai, was sighned. When the film was announced, Anil Kapoor, another actor who was also very close to Ghai, expressed an interest in playing the khal nayak. But the filmmaker had Sanjay Dutt in mind for the villainous Ballu and after giving him a two-line narration, Ghai told the actor that he'd have to shoot 16 hours a day and take a huge pay cut as he intended to make it as a big budget extravaganza to which Dutt agreed and Ghai booked a full page ad in a film weekly to announce the news. He then grabbed headlines by moving to Tips, which was paying him Rs 1 crore for the music over HMV's Rs 40 lakh. It was a biggest deal of its kind at the time but he lived up to the expectations with the film turning out many chart busters including the ever-popular \"Choli Ke Peechey Kya Hai\", which was an instant hit. The music label sold one crore cassettes in the first release itself. \"But then a lawyer from Delhi, who had heard his four-year-old son singing the \"obscene\" song, moved court on the grounds that it was polluting the child's mind and degrading Indian culture. Politicians and women's organisations jumped into the fray and suddenly, I was battling 32 political parties, trying to persuade them to see the film before jumping to conclusions,\" reminisces Ghai. Bal Thackeray came to his defence after watching the movie in a private screening, calling it a \"patriotic\" film in his paper Saamana and asserting that there was nothing wrong with the \"Choli\" song. However, the controversy it raised cost Ghai a National Award. \"I lost by one vote to Yash Chopra's Darr,\" he sighs. Another unanticipated controversy was the arrest of Sanjay for illegal possession of arms. They were shooting the climax in a courtroom and the news left them shocked. Soon after, his 'khal nayak' was arrested and many demanded a ban on the film. Ghai persevered, the film opened with 11 premieres across Delhi, attended by 10 top directors, including Shekhar Kapur, Rakesh Roshan and JP Dutta. \"Sanjay was out on bail and when I saw a crowd of 10,000 cheering him and Madhuri outside each of these 11 theatres, I was reassured. Never before or after have I got this kind of a response,\" he exults. The premiere in Los Angeles too drew such huge crowds that police on horses were called to control them, much to their surprise since an Indian film had never created such craze outside of India before. Khal Nayak celebrated a golden jubilee run (52 weeks) and 12 years after its release, the British Film Institute informed Ghai that its students had voted it into a top 10 list of best of international films of the century. It was ranked in the top 100 films of world cinema by film magazine Sight and Sound , in its January 2000 issue. 39th Filmfare Awards |- ! Title\u00a0!!

It especially remembered for its songs with excellent music by Hemant Kumar and some excellent lyrics by Gulzar in songs like Tum pukar lo\u2026tumhara intezaar hai sung by Hemant Kumar, Woh shaam kuch ajeeb thi by Kishore Kumar and Humne dekhi hai in aankhon ki mehekti khushboo sung by Lata Mangeshkar. Though what really made this film stand out was the B&W cinematography by Kamal Bose, who won the Filmfare Award for his work in the film and critical acclaim received for Rajesh Khanna's performance. The film is considered Waheeda Rehman's finest acting feat, as she carries the entire film through her powerful yet understated acting, she received a Filmfare nomination for it. This movie is often considered to be most successful film of Waheeda Rehman box-office wise as it ran due to the craze for Rajesh Khanna. The film was shot in Calcutta. The film is based on Bengali short story titled, 'Nurse Mitra' by noted Bengali writer, Ashutosh Mukherjee. Though some regard this film to be a remake of director Asit Sen's own Bengali film, Deep Jwele Jaai (1959) starring Suchitra Sen. However the Bengali version was successful only in cities in Bengal and a failure in rural areas. Impressed by the storyline, producer Vuppunuthula Purushotham Reddy and director G. Ramineedu remade the Bengali film into Chivaraku Migiledi (1960) which was a blockbuster. Hence Asit Sen remade the Hindi version on the same lines as the Telugu film Chivaraku Migiledi (1960).This film is counted among the 17 consecutive hit films Rajesh Khanna between 1969 and 1971, by adding the two hero films Marayada and Andaz to the 15 consecutive solo hits he gave from 1969 to 1971..   Director Asit Sen (not to be confused with the actor-comedian Asit Sen) acted in the original Bengali film Deep J\u00e9l\u00e9 Jaai (1959) in a role, which was essayed by Dharmendra in Khamoshi, where the movie-goers actually could not recognise him because it was a dark scene marked with the baritone voice of Hemant Kumar. Later he revealed himself in an interview in the 1990s. After his success in off-beat films, Mamta (1966) and Anokhi Raat (1968), Sen wanting to make it big in Bombay as well decided to remake his Bengali hit. Actress Waheeda Rehman suggested the name of actor Rajesh Khanna, having been impressed by his work in Aakhri Khat (1966). She said that her own performance came \"nowhere near Suchitra Sen.\" She credited the director for helping her lot during difficult scenes.Waheeda Rehman said in an interview that she could not meet the standards set by Savitri in Chivaraku Migiledi (1960) for the character. Colonel Sahab is a doctor in a psychiatry ward and Nurse Radha (Waheeda Rahman) is heart-broken after a civilian patient, Dev Kumar (Dharmendra), whom she cared for, pouring out her love and affection, leaves the hospital, as she had been unable to keep her heart separate from her professional work and had fallen in love with her patient. Next Arun Choudury (Rajesh Khanna), a writer and poet enters as a patient, suffering acute mania after being rejected by his lover, Sulekha. After refusing to take his care, Radha relents and starts nursing him. In between while caring for Arun she reminisces her past and tells a story of how she took care of injured brave army soldiers when she was posted in Laddakh during the Sino-Indian war of 1962. Gradually Arun gets cured by the love of Nurse Radha, who yet again falls hopelessly in love with her patient. Unable to hide from the truth yet unable to face it, Radha herself goes insane and is admitted to the same clinic. Arun, promises to wait for her until she recovers, finding no other options that he could choose to make her better again.

He meets Vikram & Nisha, two slackers in the college who just love playing pranks. Ajay is way different from them & an easy target. But after some initial hiccups, Ajay becomes friends with them. Soon, the trio are playing pranks on unsuspecting people. One day, they spot a stingy Seth(a wealthy man) & send him a fake typewritten extortion note, hoping to relieve him of his money. However, the next day, they find out through the newspaper that the man is dead. Based on the circumstances, they realize that they might end up as prime suspects in the case. They decide to destroy their incriminating typewriter, only to find it missing. Also, they realize that a stranger(Dev Kumar) is stalking them. Ajay & Nisha decide to tell police the truth, whether they believe it or not. But even before they can tell the truth, they are horrified to find Vikram dead. They meet Inspector Bhupendra Singh, who is investigating the case. The Inspector is sceptical, but gives them one chance to prove their innocence. From Vikram's personal belongings, they find out about a club singer named Sherie. Anticipating that Sherie may know as to why Vikram was killed, they go to meet Sherie. But when they go to her dressing room after her performance, they find her dead. The duo realize that Sherie was involved in some shady deals and Vikram was her partner. After trying to find out some information, they learn that Sherie acted as a middleman between a dreaded criminal named Black Cobra & the people who paid him. After learning that Black Cobra is an extortionist & the dead man was also on his payroll, blocks suddenly start falling into places. Ajay & Nisha deduce that the Seth thought the note was from Black Cobra & confronted him. The Seth thought that Black Cobra became more greedy and threatened to expose him, following which he was killed by latter. Black Cobra thought that Vikram & Sherie were extorting people in his name, behind his back, so he killed them. He also stole the typewriter to frame Ajay & Nisha. It becomes clear that the person following them is either Black Cobra himself, or his henchman. Though they have no concrete information about Black Cobra, they find some information secretly hidden by Sherie, that might unmask Black Cobra. The stranger confronts them, but the duo overpower him & escape. They inform the Inspector about their findings. The Inspector calls them to meet him in an abandoned place. Ajay give him all the incriminating evidence, but to his astonishment, the Inspector burns all of it. He shocks him by telling that he is none other than Black Cobra himself. Suddenly Ajay realizes that he played right into his hands. Black Cobra coolly goes on to declare that since he knows pretty much everything, he has to kill him & pin the blame of all the killings on him. He denies that he sent any man behind them. Just he is about to pull the trigger, the stranger makes an entry & after some fight the Black Cobra is put behind the bars. To a bewildered Ajay & Nisha, the stranger reveals that he is Charlie, an undercover police officer working on the murder cases. He tells that he suspected Vikram & Sherie of running the extortion racket much before the first murder. He already knew about the prank, but was unsure of the killer's identity. So he stole their typewriter. Then Cobra killed Vikram & Sherie to keep his secret intact. Then he knew that Cobra is behind all this & used the duo to track down Cobra. He reassures Ajay & Nisha that even though Black Cobra destroyed all the proof, there is no proof against the duo either. He tells the duo to collect the typewriter from him the next day.

It is a remake of the Australian mini-series Return to Eden (1983), and is about a wealthy widow who is almost killed by her lover and sets out for revenge. The film was a comeback venture for Rekha and was a critical and commercial success. The film was remade in Telugu as Gowthami starring Suhasini.   Aarti Verma (Rekha) is a widow with two children. She is an unattractive woman with a large birthmark on her face. Aarti's husband died in a car accident under mysterious circumstances, and her father (Saeed Jaffrey) is one of the richest and most famous businessmen in the city. However, when Aarti's father is murdered by his worker Hiralal (Kader Khan), Aarti's world is completely destroyed. She does not find any sense for her life, except bringing up her children. Hiralal pretends to be a friend, and takes care of her like a father. He brings his poor nephew Sanjay (Kabir Bedi) from abroad, who is also the lover of Aarti's best friend Nandini (Sonu Walia). Although Nandini loves Aarti, she is intensely in love with Sanjay, and after he requests her to help him, she finally agrees to help him rob Aarti of her wealth. Slowly, Sanjay gets close to Aarti's children. Nandini and the rest of the family convince Aarti to marry Sanjay and finally, she marries him. The day after the wedding, Aarti, Sanjay and Nandini go on a short trip, in which Sanjay pushes Aarti from the rowboat into crocodile-infested waters, so that she dies, and he inherits her wealth. The crocodile mauls Aarti and mutilates her body and face. However, Aarti's body is not found and Sanjay cannot inherit the legacy until her body is found and her death is established beyond any doubt. As a result, the family is in a serious situation. Sanjay, out of frustrations becomes abusive to the children and Aarti's pets. While all of this is occurring, Aarti is found adrift by an old farmer, who rescues her. A few months later, the horribly-disfigured Aarti decides to return to her city and avenge herself and her family. She exchanges her expensive diamond earrings for a huge amount of money, using the money to pay for extensive plastic surgery, and becomes a stunningly beautiful woman, very different from her earlier self. Aarti then changes her name to Jyoti and finds a job as a model in the same agency where Nandini works as well. Now a new person with a new identity, her goal is to conquer Sanjay as a stranger, and kill him in the same way as he had tried to kill her. Aarti, now \"reincarnated\" as Jyoti, goes on a dangerous journey of murder and revenge, and she will not be satisfied until she regains her home, family and dignity. The film has four songs composed by Rajesh Roshan: It is said that the song,Main Teri Hoon Jaanam is lifted from a song from the hollywood movie Chariots of Fire Reviews towards Khoon Bhari Maang were positive, with most of the critics' praise being directed towards Rekha's performance. In a 2000 article reviewing the last two decades in Hindi cinema, Bhawana Somaaya from The Hindu wrote, \"Rakesh Roshan offers Rekha the role of a lifetime in Khoon Bhari Maang.\" M.L. Dhawan from The Tribune, while documenting the famous Hindi films of 1988, argued, \"With Khoon Bhari Maang, Rakesh Roshan destroyed the myth that it was essential to have a hero as the protagonist and that heroines were there just to serve as interludes and mannenquins.\" Dhawan further noted, \"This fast-paced movie was a crowning glory for Rekha, who rose like a phoenix in this remake of Return to Eden, and bedazzled the audience with her daredevilry.\" Akshay Shah from Planet Bollywood wrote, \"a perfect female oriented...

Someone) is a 2003 Bollywood science fiction film directed by Rakesh Roshan (who also has a cameo role), starring Hrithik Roshan and Preity Zinta in the lead roles with Rekha playing an important supporting role. Initially, Aishwarya Rai was offered the role of Nisha. After she declined, the role went to Zinta. The film was released on 8 August 2003. It was shot in Kasauli, Nanital, Bhimtal and in Canada. Koi... Mil Gaya has received the National Film Award for Best Film on Other Social Issues, and was screened at the Jerusalem Film Festival and the NatFilm Festival in Denmark. The film has garnered the Best Picture, Best Director (Rakesh Roshan) and Best Actor (Hrithik Roshan) awards in all major award ceremonies of 2003 including the Filmfare Awards, IIFA Awards, Screen Awards, etc. It is widely regarded as Bollywood's very first sci-fi film. It spawned two sequels \u2014 Krrish and Krrish 3 \u2014 making it the first of the Krrish film series. It also spawned a spin-off animation-cum-live-action series titled J Bole Toh Jadoo that aired on Nickelodeon (India). The film's theme has parallels to both the 1982 Hollywood hit E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and the 1960s story that E.T. itself was said to have been inspired by, The Alien by Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray. Director Roshan has stated that Koi... Mil Gaya is 'not an Indian E.T.' The story of a intellectually disabled boy coming in contact with an alien appears to parallel The Alien more closely than E.T.    Scientist Sanjay Mehra (Rakesh Roshan) creates a computer program from which he sends variations of the syllable om into space, hoping to attract the attention of extraterrestrial life. When he believes he has finally gotten a response, the scientific community mocks him. While driving home, an alien spacecraft appears overhead. Mehra veers off the road, causing the car to hit a stone, flip over, and explode. While Mehra dies, his pregnant wife Sonia (Rekha) survives the wreck and returns home to India. When their son Rohit (Hrithik Roshan) is born, he is mentally disabled due to the injury he received in the accident while still being a fetus. Sonia later learns from a doctor that although surgery is the only solution to Rohit's disability, it could potentially result in his paralysis or even death. His mother raises him in the town of Kasauli, where he grows up to be a man of limited intellect and childish personality, but with a loving and emotional heart. Rohit has a number of much younger friends: loyal children who play with him. Nisha (Preity Zinta), a young lady comes to Kasauli and is initially antagonistic to Rohit due to his childish pranks against her. This causes her suitor, Raj (Rajat Bedi), and his friends to constantly harass Rohit, resulting in them breaking his scooter. Later, Nisha is sympathetic towards him and humors him, knowing about his mental disability from his mother, who chastises Nisha and Raj for assaulting Rohit and breaking his scooter. She invites Rohit to her house and introduces him to her parents, who are also sympathetic to Rohit and humor his childish interests. Rohit and Nisha, now good friends, find Sanjay's old 'om' computer and inadvertently summon the aliens. The visiting aliens leave in haste, leaving one behind by accident. Rohit, Nisha and Rohit's friends find and befriend the alien, naming him Jadoo (\"Magic\") when they discover his psychokinetic abilities. Raj does not like Nisha's friendship with Rohit and spreads a fake rumour that he and Nisha are going to get married. This does not bode well with Nisha, who becomes upset with Raj. Rohit, however, is hurt as he was under the impression that Nisha and him were 'boyfriend and girlfriend'. Jadoo discovers that Rohit is mentally abnormal so he uses his special powers, derived from sunlight, to enhance Rohit's mind. The next morning, Rohit finds himself independent of wearing glasses and has clear vision; he later solves a 10th standard mathematics problem, surprising his mathematics teacher and principal immensely. He later lectures his computer teacher for underestimating and insulting him and to understand the responsibilities of being a computer teacher. As a result, Rohit finds himself accepted by most of his peers and other students at the school. Due to Jadoo, Rohit also becomes good at dance and sport, due to his physical strength and agility being increased to superhuman levels. Raj and his friends attempt to embarrass Rohit and his little friends by challenging them to a basketball match, although are surprised when Rohit uses his new physique to score several baskets at the beginning of the match. Raj and his gang become desperate and begin to play dirty; this causes the game to turn to their favor. After the Sun comes out, Jadoo uses the sunlight to help Rohit and his young friends in the basketball game with humorous results and Rohit's group eventually win the game when Rohit scores the match point in under 10 seconds, greatly amazing the judges and announcer. Nisha and Rohit spend more time together, and Nisha begins to see Rohit in a romantic light. Rohit later proposes to her and she accepts. Jadoo's presence is kept a secret from everyone except Rohit, Nisha, Rohit's friends and mother. Raj and his friends later corner Rohit's friends on their supernatural performance at the basketball game. Rohit's friends are forced to flee and Jadoo accidentally falls from their grip. Inspector Sukhwani, (Johnny Lever) sees Jadoo in his bag and informs the other policemen of him. The policemen capture the bag, although Rohit arrives in time to rescue Jadoo, leaving the Police behind. He is later confronted by Raj and his buddies. Rohit, now infuriated by the bullies, easily takes down Raj and his buddies but not before the police catch up to him. It is then revealed that Jadoo was not in the bag and had escaped when Sukhwani was busy calling the Police. However, the Policemen are suspicious of Rohit and confront him in his house. They take Jadoo and knock Rohit out. When he regains conscience, Rohit uses his superhuman speed to catch up to the police cars and arrives just in time to save Jadoo from being taken to America by aeroplane. The spaceship, which he had summoned with his father's computer beforehand, arrives and Rohit bids farewell to Jadoo. As Jadoo leaves, Rohit loses the physical and mental powers bestowed upon him and reverts to his childish, disabled self, which saves him from prosecution by the Indian government. After everything dies down, Raj and his buddies return to harass Rohit, causing the latter to kick Raj's ball into the bully's face with astounding force as Jadoo returns Rohit's powers permanently. Rohit and Nisha thanks Jadoo and live a peaceful life forever. The film's soundtrack was first released in 2004 by Saregama. The music was composed by Rajesh Roshan, and the lyrics were by Dev Kohli. It also uses uncredited music from the Art of Noise (\"Moments in Love\") and Kraftwerk (\"Trans-Europe Express\"). The songs were immensely popular in the year. All the songs were copied from different albums from different nations. Koi... Mil Gaya received highly positive reviews from the critics and was declared a \"Blockbuster\" by Indian Box office. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the film received 75% 'Certified Fresh'. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama noted, \"Hrithik Roshan dominates the show and packs in a power-pack performance. The role of a mentally challenged person is no cakewalk, but the actor takes to it like a fish takes to water. He manages to pull off the zero to hero routine exceptionally well. As an actor, he scales dizzier heights with this splendid performance\". Winner",

The music was composed by Rajesh Roshan, with the background score by Salim-Sulaiman. Filming was done to a large extent in Singapore as well as India. The film was released worldwide in June 2006 at a cost of over \u20b9450 million (US$7.0\u00a0million) and on 1000 prints, both near-record amounts for an Indian film at the time. Krrish received mixed reviews from critics in India, but got a record opening week at the box office. The film became the second highest earning Indian film of 2006 and grossed a worldwide total of \u20b91.17 billion (US$18\u00a0million). The film won both the National and Filmfare awards for special effects, while actor Hrithik Roshan received praise and numerous best actor awards for his role. The third film in the series, Krrish 3 was released in 2013.   Five-year-old Krishna Mehra undergoes an intelligence quotient test by a professor, who suspects that he has superpowers. His grandmother Sonia (Rekha) takes the young Krishna to a remote mountain village to conceal his unique abilities. Years later, Krishna (Hrithik Roshan) meets Priya (Priyanka Chopra) and her friend Honey (Manini Mishra) when Krishna's friend Bahadur (Hemant Pandey) takes the girls' camping crew near his home to camp. Krishna saves Priya from a hang glider accident and falls in love with her when spending time with her. After returning home to Singapore, Priya and Honey are fired by their boss (Archana Puran Singh) for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. In order to keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Krishna's grandmother objects to this, saying that people will want to take advantage of his abilities. She then explains that his father Rohit was hired by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) to design a computer that could see the future in order to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. However, Rohit later found out that the purpose of the computer was not for good and he destroyed the machine. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother dying of a broken heart shortly thereafter. Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself much to the disappointment of Honey and Priya, who get fired again. Krishna later meets with kristian Li (Bin Xia), who attempts to raise funds to pay for his young sister's leg surgery. He invites Krishna and Priya to the Great Bombay Circus, where fire breaks out during the performance. Several children remain trapped in the blaze, and Krishna gets faced with the dilemma of saving the children without revealing his abilities. He dons a broken black mask and puts his jacket on inside-out, creating the persona of Krrish. Later, when Kristian Li sees Krrish fighting some goons and removing his mask, he discovers his friend Krishna as Krrish. As Krrish is being offered a reward for his deeds, Krishna asks Kristian to assume the identity, so that he can pay for his sister's surgery. Meanwhile, Priya also comes to know that Krishna is Krrish when she sees the footage from her video camera. She and Honey decide to release the footage on TV to make Krishna a star. Krishna arrives and overhears them talking about how Priya had lied to him, and how they will reveal his identity. Just before Priya confesses to Honey that she has genuinely fallen in love with Krishna, he leaves, dejected. After being confronted by Krishna at his hotel about what she said, Priya realises her mistake and stops her boss from revealing Krrish's identity. She then meets Vikram Sinha (Sharat Saxena), who has been searching for Krishna for years. He informs them that Krishna's father Rohit is still alive, and that after completing the machine, he and Rohit tested it and saw Siddhant holding a gun to Rohit's head. Rohit understood that Siddhant was going to kill him and then use the machine for his own selfish needs. He was able to destroy the machine, before being taken prisoner by Siddhant. Meanwhile, in the present timeline, Siddhant has rebuilt the computer after many years. He uses it to reveal his future and sees Krrish killing him. Siddhant then kills Kristian, thinking that he is Krrish. Krishna later follows Siddhant to his island lair. When Siddhant looks into the future again, he sees the same thing, and is shocked to see Krrish still alive and on his island. When Krrish enters the compound, there is a vicious fight with Siddhant's thugs. Krrish eventually defeats them and saves Priya and Rohit. However Vikram gets shot in the head by Siddhant. In the final scene, Krrish wounds Siddhant fatally. Before he dies, Siddhant asks Krrish who he is, and Krishna reveals himself. After revealing to Rohit that he is his son, Krishna takes Priya and his father back to India, reuniting him with Sonia. Rohit then uses his father's special computer to call Jadoo, whose spaceship can be seen from a distance. Additional minor parts were portrayed by: Akash Khurana as young Krishna's Catholic school principal, Kiran Juneja as Priya's mother, Yu Xuan as Kristian Li's little sister, and Preity Zinta as Rohit's wife Nisha in a flashback cameo. In November 2004, the Roshans confirmed he would produce a sequel to Koi... Mil Gaya (2003). They announced that actors Hrithik Roshan and Rekha would return for the sequel, but that Preity Zinta would be replaced by Priyanka Chopra. Chopra also confirmed the same, adding, \"The story will start where Koi... Mil Gaya ended.\" Rakesh Roshan hoped that the film would be remembered as the first to prove that the Indian film industry is equal to Hollywood. He decided to push the story forward by focusing on the son of the previous films's protagonist, who would inherit his father's special abilities. The story combined elements of Hindu religion and ancient Indian texts (the main character's name Krishna alludes to the Hindu Lord Krishna), Chinese martial arts and Hollywood films to set itself up as a film of global significance. Rakesh Roshan wanted Krrish to be a trendsetter in Indian cinema, with visual effects on par with Hollywood films. He hired Hollywood special effects experts Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma, who had both previously worked on such films as Independence Day, Godzilla and Sky Captain, to help create the visual effects for the film. Roshan also hired Hong Kong action director Tony Ching after admiring his work in Hero. Before production began, Hrithik Roshan went to China to train with Ching for the cable work that would be needed to make his character \"fly\". A story board of the film was prepared and sent to Ching to help him develop the action sequences. Additional production credits include: Farah Khan\u00a0\u2013 dance choreographer, Samir Chanda and Sham Kaushal\u00a0\u2013 art directors, Baylon Fonesca and Nakul Kamte\u00a0\u2013 sound, Nahush Pise\u00a0\u2013 makeup artist, Sham Kaushal\u00a0\u2013 assistant action director. Krrish was the first Indian film to be shot in Singapore under the Singapore Tourism Board's Film-in-Singapore subsidy scheme, and more than 60% of the film was shot there. Shooting was accomplished on location over a span of two months, from September to November 2005. Locations featured included the Singapore Zoo, the Gateway building, and the Singapore National Library. Another major filming location was Robinson Road, where heavy rains caused production delays. The Singapore police were on location to block roads and protect the filming equipment, such as when the film's action scenes required two 250-foot high industrial cranes. Author Audrey Yue noted that the film shoot benefited Singapore by leading to domestic and Indian film-induced tourism. Filming also took place in Manali and Film City in Mumbai. During filming of a flying stunt, one of the wires that was tied to Hrithik Roshan broke, causing him to fall 50 feet, though he landed safely on a shop's canopy. Hrithik described the incident as a \"freak accident\", stating, \"I was skydiving to my death till I fell on a six-feet-long canopy of a shop that was out because of the slight drizzle. The canopy had iron rods. But I missed those rods too. What do I say? I guess the right word to describe the situation would be jadoo (magic).\" Roshan also suffered other injuries during the film's production. He tore the hamstring in his right leg during a circus scene, singed his hair while running through fire in another action scene, and broke his thumb and toe during strenuous training for the wirework. Indian firm Prasad EFX assigned a team of more than 100 VFX specialists to work with Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma to create the visual effects for the film. Included were sophisticated 3D modelling and computer animation, including whole body scans, 3D replicas of vehicles, fire sequences, complicated wire removals and compositing work. They prepared over 1,200 VFX shots, accounting for approximately 90 minutes of screen time. Describing the effects, Rakesh Roshan stated, \"If you liked the visual effects in Koi... Mil Gaya, you will find them far better in Krrish. I do not think audiences have seen anything like this in Hindi films.\" The film's soundtrack, composed by Rajesh Roshan, was released on 28 April 2006 by T-Series. Lyricists included Ibraheem Ashk, Nasir Faraaz, and Vijay Akela. Salim-Sulaiman provided the background score. It became the seventh best selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year. Critical reviews of the soundtrack were generally favourable, though some in the media called it a disappointment. Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gave the album a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, saying that it was \"another good outing for Bollywood music lovers.\" He especially praised the songs \"Chori Chori\", \"Koi Tumsa Nahi\", and \"Pyaar Ki Ek Kahani.\" Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave a favourable review for the soundtracks's \"catchy\" songs. However, she felt that while the songs meshed with the film, \"none of them bear the staying power of Rajesh Roshan's earlier soundtracks.\" Shruti Bhasin of Planet Bollywood enjoyed the original songs, giving 8.5 out of 10 stars, but was disappointed with the remixes. Dr Mandar V. Bichu of Gulf News said that it did not live up to the pre-release expectations. The final budget of Krrish came to \u20b9450 million (US$7.0\u00a0million), which at the time was considered big-budget film by Bollywood standards. The film was released on 23 June 2006 with 1,000 prints, and in five languages simultaneously. It was the first Indian film to receive payments in advance for product placement, music, and international distribution rights. There was also related merchandise offered for sale prior to the film's release to maximize profits. These included action figures, masks and other toys. The film's DVD was released in Region 1 on 18 August 2006, by Adlabs. On 21 August 2006, it was released for all regions by Filmkraft. Adlabs also released a Blu-ray version. After the success of Krrish, Rakesh Roshan announced that he would be making a sequel, tentatively titled Krrish 3. He confirmed that Hrithik Roshan and Priyanka Chopra would reprise their roles, and that the main antagonist would be played by Vivek Oberoi. Krrish received mixed reviews from critics in India. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama believed that the film surpassed expectations, but felt that there were issues with pacing in first hour. Overall, he deemed Krrish to be \"a terrifically exciting and compelling experience\", and awarded the film 4.5 of 5 stars. Nikhat Kazmi noted in The Times of India that while the superhero and action sequences were appealing, there were not enough of them. He was also not excited by the romantic parts, comparing them to a sightseeing tour, first in India and then in Singapore. He said that overall, this film lacks the fun of its predecessor. On the other hand, Raja Sen said that Krrish was infinitely better than KMG, though ultimately it was all about Hrithik Roshan. Sen and Sukanya Verma, writing for Rediff, both gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and both said that it was a good film for children. Sen summarised \"So, is it a good superhero movie? No, but it's well-intentioned. It's a full-on kiddie movie, and while a lot of us might be scornful of Krrish, it's heartening to see fantasy officially entering mainstream Bollywood.\" Verma agreed with other critics that it took too long for the action to get started, and said that a lot of attention was spent showing off Roshan's muscles. He summarised, \"Krrish neither has the sleek aura nor the deep-rooted ideology of superheroes. What it does have is a super spirited performance from Hrithik Roshan, which is likely to appeal to children. And that's worth a three-star cheer.\" Saibal Chatterjee wrote in the Hindustan Times that Krrish is a hackneyed, formulaic masala film, with special effects added on top, and hoped that this would not be the future of Bollywood. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN condemned the screenplay and thought that the only thing that made the film watchable was the acting of Hrithik Roshan. He gave the film only 2 out of 5 stars, saying \"Krrish is only an average film that could have been so much better if the makers had concentrated as hard on its story as they did on its action and stunts.\" Overseas reviews were consistently positive. The Rotten Tomatoes aggregate rating is 100% \"Fresh\", based on 7 reviews, with an average rating of 7 out of 10. Richard James Havis of The Hollywood Reporter stated, \"This Bollywood epic crunches together romance, comedy, extraterrestrials, martial arts, dancing and action to tell an entertaining story about a reluctant Indian superhero\" but said it may be \"far too crazed for foreign viewers\". David Chute of LA Weekly deemed it a \"hearty pulp cinema that really sticks to your ribs\". Likewise, Laura Kern of The New York Times said it was a blend of carefree romance, show-stopping action and sci-fi. Ronnie Scheib of Variety said that it was an \"enjoyable, daffily improbable escapist romp\". He praised the action sequences as ingeniously choreographed, but very family-friendly. Though Jaspreet Pandohar of BBC was critical of the script for being \"low on originality\", he praised Hrithik Roshan's performance and the action scenes. Dr. P.V. Vaidyanathan, in a review for BBC Shropshire, said that the film's excellent special effects were as good as the best from Hollywood, praised Hritik's acting, but called the music mundane. Krrish had a good opening week, and tickets were reportedly selling for many times the original cost at some locations. Total gross collections were an Indian record of \u20b9416 million (US$6.4\u00a0million) (\u20b9297 million (US$4.6\u00a0million) nett) for its opening week. Krrish became the second-highest-grossing film of 2006, earning over \u20b9 690\u00a0million nett in India alone, and was classified as a \"Blockbuster\" by Box Office India. It also grossed $4,320,000 in the overseas market, where it was declared a \"hit\". The final worldwide total gross was \u20b91.17 billion (US$18\u00a0million). One week after Krrish was released, another superhero film, Superman Returns was released in India. Rakesh Roshan stated, \"I was a little skeptical that Superman might hurt me, but fortunately it didn't.\" In fact, Krrish fared better at the box office in India than Superman Returns did. Krrish was one of India's possible nominations for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, but the country ultimately chose Rang De Basanti as its pick. Despite this, Krrish won numerous awards, including three Filmfare Awards\u2014Best Special Effects, Best Action and Best Background Score\u2014and was nominated for the awards of Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Villain. At the 2007 IIFA Awards, Krrish received awards for Best Actor, Best Action, and Best Special Effects. Rakesh Roshan won the Creative Person of the Year title. Additionally the film was nominated in the following categories at the ceremony: Best Director, Best Story, and Best Music Direction. Hrithik Roshan won other acting awards that year, including the Star Screen Award Best Actor, Zee Cine Award for Best Actor\u00a0\u2013 Male, BFJA\u00a0\u2013 Best Actor Award (Hindi) and GIFA Best Actor. The film's special effects won the National Film Award for Best Special Effects. The film also took Best Picture honours at the Matri Shree Media Awards. In a showing of the film's popularity with children, Krrish swept the major film categories at the Pogo Amazing Kid's Awards, which are voted on by children across India. Winners were: Hrithik Roshan (Most Amazing Actor\u00a0\u2014 Male), Priyanka Chopra (Most Amazing Actor\u00a0\u2014 Female), Krrish (Most Amazing Film), Special Effects in Krrish (Most Amazing Moment in a film).",

        "full_text": " Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (English: Something Happens) also known as KKHH, is an Indian Hindi coming-of-age romantic comedy drama film, released in India and the United Kingdom on 16 October 1998. It was written and directed by Karan Johar, and starred the popular on-screen pair of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol in their fourth film together. Rani Mukerji featured in a supporting role, while Salman Khan also had an extended-cameo appearance. Sana Saeed, who was featured in a supporting role, made her film debut in this movie. Filmed in India, Mauritius, and Scotland, this was Karan Johar's directorial debut. One of his goals for the film was to set a new level for style in Hindi cinema. The plot combines two love triangles set years apart. The first half covers friends on a college campus, while the second tells the story of a widower's young daughter who tries to reunite her dad with his old friend. The film was extremely successful in India and abroad, becoming the highest-grossing Indian film of the year and the third highest-grossing Indian film ever behind Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. The film was also the first Bollywood film to enter the UK cinema top ten. Outside India, the film was the highest grossing Hindi film ever until its record was broken by Karan's next directorial, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001). Kuch Kuch Hota Hai received a positive reception from critics, with special praise directed to Kajol's performance. The soundtrack also became the biggest seller of the year. The film won many major awards including the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and the \"Best Film\" honor at the Filmfare Awards, Zee Cine Awards, Screen Awards, and Bollywood Movie Awards. The film won 8 Filmfare Awards and is the only film in history to win all the four acting category awards at the ceremony (Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor & Best Supporting Actress). The film remains highly popular on Indian television and has achieved a cult classic status.   The film begins with Rahul Khanna (Shah Rukh Khan) standing in front of the funeral pyre of his wife Tina (Rani Mukerji). Through a series of flashbacks we are shown Rahul & Tina's marriage, their honeymoon, Tina's pregnancy with their daughter and the childs eventual birth. It is revealed that Tina was aware of complications in her pregnancy, during which only mother or child could be saved, but decided not to tell Rahul as she knew how much he wanted a child. During her pregnancy, Tina, who also loved the baby more than her own life, writes eight letters to her daughter (one for each of her first eight birthdays) and gives them to Rahul's mother (Farida Jalal). Before dying, Tina asks Rahul to promise her to name their daughter Anjali. Eight years pass, and Rahul is a single parent living with his daughter Anjali Khanna (Sana Saeed) and his mother. On her eighth birthday, Anjali reads the last and most important letter that her mother left her; it tells the story of how Rahul met Tina. A flashback begins from St. Xavier's College, where Rahul Khanna and his best friend, basketball loving tomboy Anjali Sharma (Kajol) are popular students. The two are close friends but deny any romantic feelings for each other. The college principal Mr. Malhotra (Anupam Kher) states that his daughter Tina is coming to St. Xavier's from London to finish her degree, and asks Anjali to be her guide and friend. Tina quickly becomes friends with Anjali and Rahul, and Rahul constantly flirts with Tina, trying to win her over. As time goes by, Anjali realises that she is indeed in love with Rahul, and is encouraged by her motherly guardian Rifat Bi (Himani Shivpuri) to tell him so. Before she is able to declare her feelings for him, Rahul instead tells Anjali that he is in love with Tina. Devastated, Anjali decides to leave college and shares a tearful goodbye with Rahul. Although she is in love with Rahul, Tina is aware that she came between him and Anjali. Back in the present, Tina explains in her letter to her daughter Anjali Khanna that Rahul always said that love is friendship, and without friendship there can be no love. Rahul is a single parent and lacks a friend in his life, so Tina gives her daughter the mission of reuniting Rahul with Anjali Sharma and bringing back Rahul's lost love and friend. The next day, Rahul, Anjali Khanna and his mom head to Faridabad where they meet Mr. Malhotra for Tina's death anniversary. Anjali Sharma is no longer the tomboy she was in college, and is now engaged to Aman Mehra (Salman Khan), an NRI living in London. However, she explains to her mother (Reema Lagoo) that she does not really love him and is marrying him as a compromise as she feels she can never love again after losing Rahul. Aman also suspects that she does not really love him. Determined to reunite her father and his best friend, Anjali Khanna and her grandmother search for Anjali Sharma and soon learn that she is going to be working at a summer camp. Rahul tells his daughter that she is not allowed to attend the summer camp and heads to a conference, only to find out that his mom and daughter went without telling him, having left a letter for him. They travel to the camp, with a plan to later lure Rahul to come as well, and the two Anjalis meet each other. One night while watching television, Anjali Sharma realizes she has met her best friend's daughter, and that Tina is dead. Rahul soon arrives at Camp Sunshine, after his daughter fakes an illness, where he and Anjali Sharma are surprised and delighted to see each other again, sharing a sweet reunion. Throughout the days spent at the camp, Rahul and Anjali feel themselves falling in love. Just as they are about to share a heated moment, Anjali thinks about her upcoming engagement and feels guilty. She blindly runs away, after which Aman arrives and tells Rahul that he is Anjali's fiancee. Rahul is heartbroken but congratulates Anjali. She takes this as him rejecting her again, so she leaves the summer camp and decides to get married to Aman as soon as possible. After seeing Tina in a dream, Rahul and his family go to Anjali's wedding, where Rahul silently confesses to Anjali that he loves her, and watches in tears as she is brought forth for the wedding. Realising this, Anjali is hesitant to go on with the marriage, and stands weeping. Aman notices the tears in her eyes and realises that she has always been in love with Rahul. He releases Anjali from the engagement and tells her to marry Rahul. Rahul and Anjali have an emotional hug and as the two marry, little Anjali Khanna sees a vision of Tina, who is smiling and giving her the thumbs up. After the experience of assisting and acting in his cousin Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the romance film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Karan Johar was encouraged to try his own hand at directing. With Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, he chose to pair up the same lead actors, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, for his own romance film. During the filming of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Khan had also encouraged Johar to make his own film, and said that he would be willing to star in it. Johar first wrote a story, which was a love triangle between a tomboy, a very pretty girl and a slightly insensitive boy, but he shelved the idea because he was not very satisfied with it. Then he wrote another plot about a widower and his child, which he shelved as well. Eventually he decided to merge the two stories into one. He explained in an interview with Rediff.com: \"It was about the trauma of a widower and his little child. How the child really wants a mother and how she brings her mother into her father's life. Then I thought: Why not bring a youth aspect to the story? Why not a flashback? That's how the story got made.\" The story also includes a \"personal desires vs. parental loyalties\" theme, and has some \"East meets West\" themes, but instead of the characters going abroad, it creates a virtual West inside India. Karan Johar was certain from the beginning that he wanted to cast Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role, having observed him during the making of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. It took longer to fill the role of Tina. The role was written with Twinkle Khanna in mind, but she turned it down. Other actresses such as Tabu, Shilpa Shetty, Urmila Matondkar, Aishwarya Rai, Raveena Tandon and Karisma Kapoor were offered the role but also turned it down. Aditya Chopra and Shah Rukh Khan noticed Rani Mukerji's beauty and acting talent in Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat, and suggested her to Karan Johar. He thus signed her, giving a boost to her career. Saif Ali Khan, Ajay Devgan and Chandrachur Singh were initially offered the role of Aman, but they all turned it down, thus prompting Johar to rope in Salman Khan. Johar, who is also a costume designer, wanted to set a new level for style in Hindi cinema with this film. He and his friend Manish Malhotra, the film's costume designer, made trips to London for costumes, much to the chagrin of his father and producer Yash Johar, who was concerned about the budget. Many of the costumes in the film prominently displayed logos from designers such as DKNY and Polo. In addition to the designer fashions, Johar also created a somewhat fantastical world where the students speak Hinglish and enjoy a pristine college campus, where there is no crime or hate, and traditional Hindu values are pervasive. Johar admitted that the look and feel of the college scenes in the film were patterned after Beverly Hills 90210, saying, \"The art, the costumes, tilt toward the West, but the soul of the film is Indian.\" He hired Sharmishta Roy as art director, and told her to produce something similar to Riverdale High School of the Archie Comics, with some 90210 influence as well. Johar said of the outcome, \"If you see KKHH, Shahrukh plays Archie, Rani Mukherji plays Veronica, and Kajol played Bettie. It was exactly that. And the principal looked like Weatherbee, and Ms. Grundy was Archana Puran Singh.\" Johar also hired Farah Khan to do the choreography, Jatin-Lalit to provide the music, Santosh Thundiyil as cinematographer, and Nikhil Advani as his associate director. Shabina Khan assisted Manish Malhotra with costume design. Filming began on 21 October 1997. The crew was young and inexperienced to the point where Shah Rukh Khan had to explain basic technicalities of filming. Khan later said, \"Karan makes no bones of the fact that his technical knowledge of filmmaking was not at its peak when he made the biggest hit of the decade.\" The entire film was shot in nine and half months with a substantial part of it shot in Mauritius. The title song was filmed over a ten-day period. in several picturesque locations in Scotland, including Eilean Donan, Glen Coe, Loch Lomond and Tantallon Castle with the nearby Bass Rock as a backdrop in one scene. During the bicycle sequence in the \"Yeh Ladka Hai Deewana\" song, Kajol lost control of her bike, fell flat on her face and was knocked unconscious while also injuring her knee. During the promotional Making of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai TV special, Kajol stated that the accident was her most memorable part of shooting the film because she doesn't remember it. During preparation for the reunion scene where the two leads met after more than 8 years apart, the director told them to improvise and rehearse the reactions that they might use, but he secretly taped them, and was so pleased with the result that it was put into the film. The Kuch Kuch Hota Hai soundtrack was composed by Jatin-Lalit and the lyrics were penned by Sameer. It was released by the Sony Music label on 13 August 1998. Mukul Deshpande of Planet Bollywood rated the soundtrack 8.5 out of 10 stars although he did not like all of the songs. The album became the best selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year. The title song remained on the Indian music charts for over a year, and the album peaked at number 2 on the Malaysian albums chart (RIM) in 1999. In 2012 it was voted as the most popular film song of the previous decade by NDTV. The full soundtrack came in second place in a similar poll conducted by the BBC. While comparing the film to Dil To Pagal Hai of 1997, Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave Kuch Kuch Hota Hai 3.5 out of 5 stars. She especially liked the performance of Kajol, and thought that the film would appeal to young and romantic viewers primarily for its \"MTV ambiance\" and \"Valentine Day flavours\". On the negative side, she said \"The second half however gets drowned in a sea of emotions. Too many people begin to cry a bit too much.\" Anish Khanna of Planet Bollywood rated the film 9.5 out of 10 stars, calling it \"pure escapist cinema at its best.\" He praised the cinematography, choreography, set decoration, and also raved over Kajol's performance, along with her onscreen chemistry with Shah Rukh Khan. Overall, he said \"Karan Johar makes an impressive directorial debut, has a good script sense, and knows how to make a film with S-T-Y-L-E.\" In contrast to these views, the reaction of Sujata C J, writing for Rediff.com, was that the film was very disappointing, with many cliches and a bad story line, though Santosh Thundiyil and Sharmishta Roy were praised for their camerawork and art direction, respectively. Nandita Chowdhury in a review for India Today, said that Karan Johar was almost able to rekindle the Khan-Kajol magic of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, and that overall the film was \"a good distraction\". There were great expectations for Kuch Kuch Hota Hai leading up to its premiere, because it re-united the Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge team of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, and specifically concerning the debut of Karan Johar, whether he would be in the same league as Aditya Chopra as a first-time writer/director. The film grossed \u20b980.12 crore (US$12\u00a0million) in India and $6.3 million (\u20b926.61 crore) in other countries, for a worldwide total of \u20b91.06 billion (US$16\u00a0million), against its \u20b910 crore (US$1.5\u00a0million) budget, and became the third film to gross over \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide after Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. It had a worldwide opening weekend of \u20b98.06 crore (US$1.2\u00a0million), and grossed \u20b915.13 crore (US$2.3\u00a0million) in its first week. It is the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide. It opened on Friday, 16 October 1998, across 240 screens, along with Bade Miyan Chote Miyan and earned \u20b987 lakh (US$130,000) nett on its opening day. It grossed \u20b92.74 crore (US$420,000) nett in its opening weekend, and went on to record the second highest first week of the year with collections around \u20b95.64 crore (US$870,000) nett after Bade Miyan Chote Miyan which grossed \u20b96.33 crore (US$980,000) nett.

The film stars Preity Zinta as a single teenage mother, with Chandrachur Singh, Anupam Kher, Farida Jalal and Saif Ali Khan playing supporting roles. Kya Kehna dealt with the taboo issue of pre-marital pregnancy and the views of society. The film premiered on 19 May 2000, and was a box office success becoming one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of 2000, establishing Zinta's career in the Hindi film industry. The film was moderately well received by film critics, with Zinta's performance being highlighted along with the treatment of issues that the story tackles. Kya Kehna won numerous accolades including the Best Story Award for Honey Irani and a nomination for Best Actress for Zinta at the 46th Filmfare Awards among others.   Priya Bakshi (Preity Zinta), the daughter of Gulshan (Anupam Kher) and Rohini Bakshi (Farida Jalal) is a young, fun loving girl. Priya's parents, brothers and best friend, Ajay (Chandrachur Singh) love and support her. Ajay is secretly in love with Priya, and wishes to marry her in the future, hopefully after she finishes her studies. Priya enters her first year in college, and she catches the eye of wealthy playboy Rahul (Saif Ali Khan) who quickly becomes attracted to her. She succumbs to his charm but Ajay and her brother Vicky are unsure about Rahul. His reputation and womanizing ways worry them, and they warn her to stay away from him. However, Priya believes that Rahul is in love with her, and the two begin a relationship and have sex. Priya convinces her parents to meet Rahul, but when they talk about marriage and the future, he mocks them and leaves Priya. Priya is heartbroken but tries to move on with her life. She later learns that she is pregnant with Rahul's child. Her parents go back to Rahul to talk about marriage once again but to their shock he refuses to marry her, regardless of the pregnancy. Priya is faced with a decision, and she chooses to keep the child. Her decision prompts her father to reluctantly banish her from the house. Alone and neglected, Priya is devastated. Later, however, her family finds it hard to live without her and they bring her back, supporting her during her pregnancy. Her family has accepted her, but now she has to face the society and overcome the disdain of her neighbors and friends. Priya and her family are ostracized and looked down upon. Upon going back to college, she finds out that all of her friends now mock her, and girls prefer to stay away from her due to her 'spoiled' character. During all this time Ajay had been quietly and consistently supporting her, and Priya realized the true love and dedication that he had for her. With his encouragement and with the love for the child she is nurturing in her womb, she makes people realize that she isn't immoral or characterless, but a girl who loved someone immensely. She says that if only she had gotten married, maybe the scenarios would have been different, maybe her child would have been loved and valued, rather than abused and insulted. With these words, she eventually gains the support of those who had earlier disrespected her. Her friends finally accepted her the way they did before and she goes a back to normal life. After some time, she manages to change Rahul's views as well and he decides to marry her. Priya and her family are celebrating the birth of her baby, when Rahul tries to re-enter her life. Rahul says that he is ready to marry her and raise their child together. At the same time, Ajay also proposed to Priya. Priya, who is in love with Ajay, selects him over Rahul stating that a shameless man like Rahul can never be a reliable husband or father. The soundtrack of the film contains 8 songs. The music is conducted by the award-winning composer Rajesh Roshan, with lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri. The title song is a copy of the 1960 song Oh! Carol by Neil Sedaka. The film was a box office success and emerged as one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of 2000, and was declared a \"hit\" in India. Vinayak Chakravorty of Hindustan Times gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing, \"The basic premise of Kya Kehna!, then, definitely had the potential of being a gripping family entertainer. Unfortunately, somewhere down the line you feel as if most people associated with the film somehow lost interest.\" He noted, however, Preity Zinta as \"the bright spot of the film\". Aradhika Sekhon of The Tribune wrote, \"The movie itself has several flaws but the issues that it tackles are real. The director takes a straight, hard look at the problems of today and holds them up for exhibition. The Indian tendency is to sweep uncomfortable issues under the carpet but if films like Kya Kehna continue to be made, at least, we'll be forced to confront them.\" Mimmy Jain of The Indian Express, in a positive review, commeded Shah for making \"a sensitive film, on a sensitive subject\", calling Kya Kehna \"a film that should have been made years ago\". She further noted Zinta as being \"dazzlingly good\" in her part. Filmfare, in a three-star review, wrote that the film is \"worth a watch\" and attributed its success to Zinta's \"very convincing performance\". Sharmila Taliculam from Rediff.com was critical of the film, concluding, \"Apart from the climax, the film is no big deal.\"",

        "full_text": " Lagaan (Hindi: \u0932\u0917\u093e\u0928, \"Taxation\"; also called Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India) is a 2001 Indian epic sports-drama film written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. Aamir Khan, who was also the producer, stars with Gracy Singh in the lead roles; British actors Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne play the supporting roles. Made on a then-unprecedented budget of \u20b9250 million (equivalent to \u20b9700\u00a0million or US$11\u00a0million in 2016), the film was shot in an ancient village near Bhuj, India. The film is set in the Victorian period of India's colonial British Raj. The story revolves around a small village whose inhabitants, burdened by high taxes, find themselves in an extraordinary situation as an arrogant officer challenges them to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid the taxes. The narrative spins around this situation as the villagers face the arduous task of learning the alien game and playing for a result that will change their village's destiny. Lagaan received critical acclaim and awards at international film festivals, as well as many Indian film awards. It became the third Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film after Mother India (1957) and Salaam Bombay! (1988). It was one of the biggest box office hits of 2001. In 2010, the film was ranked No. 55 in Empire magazines \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\". In 2011, it was listed in Time magazine's special \"The All-TIME 25 Best Sports Movies\". The film was screened retrospective as the Closing Film on August 18, 2016 at the Independence Day Film Festival jointly presented by the Indian Directorate of Film Festivals and Ministry of Defense, commemorating 70th Indian Independence Day.   In the small town of Champaner (in the state of Gujarat, western India) during the height of the British empire in India in 1893. Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), the commanding officer of the Champaner cantonment, has imposed high taxes (\"Lagaan\") on people from the local villages that they are unable to pay due to a prolonged drought. Led by Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), the villagers beg Raja Puran Singh (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) to help them. He tells them that, much to his regret, he is bound by British law. After their visit to the Raja, the villagers witness a cricket match. Bhuvan mocks the game and gets into an argument with one of the British officers. Taking an instant dislike to Bhuvan, Russell offers to cancel the taxes of the whole province \"for three years\" if the villagers can beat his men in a game of cricket. If the villagers lose, however, they will have to pay three times their normal taxes. Bhuvan accepts this wager on behalf of the villages in the province, without their consent. When the other villagers learn about the bet, they are furious with Bhuvan. He argues that it is important for everyone to fight against British rule. Bhuvan begins to prepare the villagers for the match. He initially finds only five people willing to join the team. He is aided in his efforts by Russell's sister Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley) who feels that her brother has mistreated the villagers. As she teaches them the rules of the game, she falls in love with Bhuvan, much to the anguish of Gauri (Gracy Singh) who is also in love with him. After Bhuvan reassures Gauri of his feelings for her, the woodcutter Lakha (Yashpal Sharma) becomes enraged as he is in love with Gauri. In an attempt to discredit Bhuvan, Lakha offers himself as a spy for Russell and joins the villagers' team to destroy it. Eventually the villagers realise that winning equals freedom. As a few of them are insulted by the British, they join the team. Short one player, Bhuvan invites an untouchable, Kachra (Aditya Lakhia), who can bowl spinners. The villagers, conditioned by long-term prejudice against Dalits, refuse to play if Kachra joins the team. Bhuvan chastises the villagers, shaming them into accepting Kachra. On the first day, Russell wins the toss and elects to bat, giving the British officers a strong start. Bhuvan brings Kachra into the match only to find that Kachra has somehow lost his ability to spin the ball \u2014 new cricket balls do not spin as well as worn-down ones (which the team have been practising with). In addition, as part of his agreement with Russell, Lakha deliberately drops many catches. Later that evening, Elizabeth sees Lakha meeting with her brother. She races to the village and informs Bhuvan of Lakha's deception. Rather than allow the villagers to kill him, Bhuvan offers Lakha the chance to redeem himself. The next day as part of his promise to Bhuvan, Lakha takes a diving one-handed catch. However, the British score almost 300 runs, losing only three wickets by the lunch break. Kachra is brought back to bowl and, bowling with a now-worn ball, takes a hat-trick, which sparks the collapse of the British batting side. The villagers soon start their innings. Bhuvan and Deva (a Sikh, who has played cricket earlier when he was a British sepoy) give their team a solid start. Deva misses out on his half-century when a straight-drive from Bhuvan ricochets off the bowler's hand onto the stumps at the non-striker's end, where Deva is backing up too far. When Lakha comes on to bat, he is hit on the head by a bouncer and falls onto his stumps. Other batsmen get out rashly trying to score a boundary off each delivery. Ismail (Raj Zutshi), a good batsman, retires hurt as he is hit on the leg. The villagers' team ends the day with four batsmen out of action with barely a third of the required runs on board. On the third and final day, Bhuvan passes his century, while most of the later wickets fall. Ismail returns to bat with the help of a runner and passes his half-century, reducing the required runs to an attainable total. The game comes down to the last over with Kachra on strike. With one ball remaining and the team down five runs, Kachra knocks the ball a short distance, managing a single. However, the umpire signals no ball. Bhuvan returns to bat and swings extremely hard at the next ball, hitting the ball high in the air towards the boundary. Russell backpedals and catches it, gleefully believing that the British team has won \u2014 until he realises that he has caught the ball beyond the boundary, giving six runs, and therefore victory, to Bhuvan's team. Even as they celebrate the victory, the drought ends as a rainstorm erupts. Bhuvan's defeat of the British team leads to the disbanding of the humiliated cantonment. In addition, Russell is forced to pay the taxes for the whole province and is transferred to Central Africa. After realising that Bhuvan loves Gauri, Elizabeth returns to London. Heartbroken, she remains unmarried for the rest of her life. It is revealed during epilogue, that Bhuvan went on to marry Gauri with great pomp and show. And despite the historic triumph, Bhuvan's name was lost in the pages of history. Director Ashutosh Gowariker has stated that it was almost impossible to make Lagaan. Gowariker went to Aamir, who agreed to participate after hearing the detailed script. Even after securing Khan, Ashutosh had trouble finding a producer. Producers who showed interest in the script wanted budget cuts as well as script modifications. Eventually, Aamir agreed to Ashutosh's suggestion that he'd produce the film. Aamir corroborated this by saying that the faith he had in Ashutosh, the story and script of the film, and the opportunity of starting his own production company inspired him to produce Lagaan. He also said that by being a producer himself, he was able to give greater creative freedom to Ashutosh. He cited an example: \"If the director tells the producer that he wants 50 camels, the latter will probably say, 'Why not 25? Can't you manage with 25 camels?' Whereas, if he is telling me the same thing... I will not waste time asking him questions because I am also creatively aware why he needs them.\" Jhamu Sughand co-produced the film because he liked the emotional and patriotic story. One of the first members to join the production team was Nitin Chandrakant Desai, the art director, with whom Ashutosh set out for extensive location hunt throughout India, to find the setting for the fictional town of Champaner, in late 1998. After searching through Rajasthan, Nasik, UP, they zeroed in on an ancient village near Bhuj, located in Gujarat's Kutch district, by May 1999, where the film was primarily shot. The script demanded a dry location: an agricultural village where it had not rained in several years. To depict the 1890s era, the crew also required a village which lacked electricity, communication and automobiles. Kutch faced the same problems at that time and hence the village of Kunariya, located a few miles away from Bhuj, was chosen. During the filming of Lagaan, it did not rain at all in the region. However, a week after the shoot finished, it rained heavily bringing relief to Bhuj, which had a lean monsoon the previous year. The typical old Kutch hamlet was built by the local people four months before the arrival of the crew. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake devastated this region and displaced many locals. The crew, including the English, contributed to their cause by donating \u20b9250,000 (equivalent to \u20b9700,000 or US$11,000 in 2016), with further contributions during the year. Avadhi, which is a dialect of Hindi, is primarily from a region in Uttar Pradesh. It was chosen to give the feel of the language spoken during that era. However, the language was diluted, and modern viewers can understand it. The dialogues, which were a combination of three dialects (Avadhi, Bhojpuri and Braj Bhasha) were penned by Hindi writer K. P. Saxena. Bhanu Athaiya, an Oscar winner for Gandhi, was the costume designer for the film. With a large number of extras, it was difficult for her to make enough costumes. She spent a lot of time researching to lend authenticity to the characters. Pre-planning for a year, including ten months for production issues and two months for his character, was tiring for Aamir. As a first-time producer, he obtained a crew of about 300 people for six months. Due to the lack of comfortable hotels in Bhuj, he hired a newly constructed apartment and furnished it completely for the crew. Security was set up and a special housekeeping team was brought to take care of the crew's needs. Most of the 19th century tools and equipment depicted in the film were lent to the crew by the local villagers. Initially, they did not want to part with their equipment, but after much coaxing, they gave in. They then travelled to different parts of the country to collect the musical instruments used in that day and era. During the shooting, Ashutosh suffered from a slipped disc and had to rest for 30 days. During this period, he had his bed next to the monitor and continued with his work. The filming schedule spanned the winter and summer, commencing in early January and finishing in mid-June. This was physically challenging for many, with the temperatures ranging from 0 to 50\u00a0\u00b0C (32 to 122\u00a0\u00b0F). The actors had to drink frequently and sit in the shade. The schedule was strict. The day began at 6\u00a0am, changing into costumes and getting onto the actors' bus, which took them to the sets in Kanuria. The actors, including Aamir, all travelled on the same bus. If anyone missed it, it was up to them to reach the sets. One day, Aamir was late and missed the actors' bus. That day, his wife Reena, the executive producer, reprimanded him for being late. She told him he had to set an example for the rest of the crew. \"If he started coming late, how could she tell the others to come on time?\" While on the sets, the actors were given call sheets with the day's timetable such as breakfast, hair styling, make-up, costumes, etc. Before its worldwide release, Aamir Khan kept a promise to screen the film to the locals of Bhuj. Lagaan clashed with Sunny Deol's Gadar: Ek Prem Katha at the box office. The film made it to the UK Top 10 after its commercial release. It was the first Indian film to have a nationwide release in China and had its dubbed version released in Italy. With favourable reviews from the French press, Lagaan premiered in Paris on 26 June 2002 and continued to have an unprecedented nine weeks of screening with over 45,000 people watching. It was released in the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, South Africa and the Middle East with respective vernacular subtitles. The film took a cumulative of $2.5 million at the international box-office and \u20b9380 million (equivalent to \u20b91.1\u00a0billion or US$16\u00a0million in 2016) at the domestic box-office. In 2001, Lagaan had a world premiere at the International Indian Film Academy Awards (IIFA) weekend in Sun City, South Africa. The Locarno International Film Festival authorities published the rules of cricket before the film was screened to a crowd which reportedly danced to its soundtrack in the aisles. Lagaan was shown four times due to public demand as against the usual norm of showcasing films once at the festival. It subsequently won the Prix du Public award at the festival. After the film's publicity in Locarno, the director, Ashutosh Gowarikar said that distributors from Switzerland, Italy, France, Netherlands, North Africa, Finland and Germany were wanting to purchase the distribution rights. Special screenings were held in Russia, where people were keen to watch the film after its Oscar nomination. Apart from these screenings, it was shown at the Sundance Film Festival, Cairo International Film Festival, Stockholm International Film Festival, Helsinki Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival. Lagaan was met with high critical acclaim. The film currently scores a 95% \"Certified Fresh\" approval rating on review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus is, \"Lagaan is lavish, rousing entertainment in the old-fashioned tradition of Hollywood musicals.\" Derek Elley of Variety suggested that it \"could be the trigger for Bollywood's long-awaited crossover to non-ethnic markets\". Somni Sengupta of The New York Times, described it as \"a carnivalesque genre packed with romance, swordplay and improbable song-and-dance routines\" Roger Ebert gave three and half out of four stars and said, \"Lagaan is an enormously entertaining movie, like nothing we've ever seen before, and yet completely familiar... At the same time, it's a memory of the films we all grew up on, with clearly defined villains and heroes, a romantic triangle, and even a comic character who saves the day. Lagaan is a well-crafted, hugely entertaining epic that has the spice of a foreign culture.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described the film as \"a lavish epic, a gorgeous love story, and a rollicking adventure yarn. Larger than life and outrageously enjoyable, it's got a dash of spaghetti western, a hint of Kurosawa, with a bracing shot of Kipling.\" Kuljinder Singh of the BBC stated that \"Lagaan is anything but standard Bollywood fodder, and is the first must-see of the Indian summer. A movie that will have you laughing and crying, but leaving with a smile.\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times argued that the film is \"an affectionate homage to a popular genre that raises it to the level of an art film with fully drawn characters, a serious underlying theme, and a sophisticated style and point of view.\" Sudish Kamath of The Hindu suggested that \"the movie is not just a story. It is an experience. An experience of watching something that puts life into you, that puts a cheer on your face, however depressed you might be.\" The Times of India wrote, \"Lagaan has all the attractions of big-sounding A. R. Rahman songs, excellent performances by Aamir Khan... and a successful debut for pretty Gracy Singh. In addition, there is the celebrated David vs Goliath cricket match, which has audiences screaming and clapping.\" Perhaps one of the most emphatic recommendations for the movie, coming 10 years later, is by John Nugent of the Trenton Independent, who wrote \"a masterpiece ... and what better way to learn a bit about India's colonial experience! History and great entertainment, all rolled in to one (albeit long) classic film.\" Lagaan was listed as number 14 on Channel 4's \"50 Films to See Before you Die\" and was the only Indian film to be listed. Aamir Khan and Gowariker went to Los Angeles to generate publicity for the Academy Awards. Khan said, \"We just started showing it to whoever we could, even the hotel staff.\" About India's official entry to the 2002 Oscars, The Daily Telegraph wrote, \"A Bollywood film that portrays the British in India as ruthless sadists and Mafia-style crooks has been chosen as Delhi's official entry to the Academy Awards.\" It added that the film was expected to win the nomination. On 12 February 2002, Lagaan was nominated for the best foreign language film at the Academy Award nominations ceremony. After the nomination, Khan reacted by saying, \"To see the name of the film and actually hear it being nominated was very satisfying\". Post-nomination reactions poured in from several parts of the world. The USA Today wrote \"Hooray for Bollywood, and India's Lagaan\". With Sony Pictures Classics distributing the film and Oscar-winning director Baz Luhrmann praising it, Lagaan had a chance to win. The BBC commented that the nomination raised Bollywood hopes that Indian films would become more popular in the US. In India, the nomination was celebrated with news reports about a win bringing in \"a great boost for the Indian film industry\" and \"a Bharat Ratna for Aamir Khan and the status of a 'national film' for Lagaan\". When Lagaan lost the award to the Bosnian film No Man's Land, there was disappointment in India. Khan said, \"Certainly we were disappointed. But the thing that really kept us in our spirits was that the entire country was behind us.\" Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt criticised the \"American film industry\" as \"insular and the foreign category awards were given just for the sake of it.\" Gowariker added that \"Americans must learn to like our films\". The film won a number of national awards including eight National Film Awards, nine Filmfare Awards, nine Screen Awards and ten IIFA Awards. Apart from these major awards, it also won awards at other national and international ceremonies. There were two releases for the DVD. The first, as a 2-DVD set, was released on 27 May 2002 in limited regions. It contained subtitles in Arabic, English, Hebrew, Hindi, Turkish and several European languages. It is available in 16:9 Anamorphic widescreen, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, progressive 24 frame/s, widescreen and NTSC format. It carried an additional fifteen minutes of deleted scenes, filmographies and trailers. The second was released as anniversary edition three-disc DVD box after six years of the theatrical release. This also included Chale Chalo which was a documentary on the making of Lagaan, a curtain raiser on the making of the soundtrack, deleted scenes, trailers, along with other collectibles.[which?] After its release, it became the highest selling DVD in India beating Sholay (1975). In the anniversary DVD edition, a National Film Award-winning documentary, Chale Chalo \u2013 the lunacy of film making, 11 collector cards, a collectible Lagaan coin embossed with the character of Bhuvan, a 35\u00a0mm CinemaScope filmstrip hand-cut from the film's filmstrip were bundled with the film. A comic book, Lagaan: The Story, along with two colouring books, a mask book and a cricket board game were subsequently released to the commercial market. The comic book, available in English and Hindi, was targeted at children between the ages of six and 14. At the book's launch, Aamir Khan said that they were keen to turn the film into a comic strip during the pre-production phase itself. In March 2002, a book titled The Spirit of Lagaan \u2013 The Extraordinary Story of the Creators of a Classic was published. It covers the making of the film, describing in detail the setbacks and obstacles that the crew faced while developing the film from concept to its release.",

        "full_text": " Lage Raho Munna Bhai (pronounced\u00a0[l\u0259\u02c8\u0261e\u02d0 r\u0259\u02c8\u0266o\u02d0 m\u028anna\u02d0\u02c8b\u02b1a\u02d0i]\u00a0( listen) meaning \"Carry On, Munna Bhai\") is a 2006 Indian comedy-drama film directed by Rajkumar Hirani and produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra. It is the follow-up to the 2003 film Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. with Sanjay Dutt reprising his role as Munna Bhai, a Mumbai (Bombay) underworld don. In Lage Raho Munna Bhai, the eponymous lead character starts to see the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi. Through his interactions with Gandhi, he begins to practice what he refers to as Gandhigiri (a neologism for Gandhism) to help ordinary people solve their problems. The film won widespread critical acclaim from critics and had a number of prominent screenings. It was a box office success and received a \"blockbuster\" rating by the website Box Office India after grossing over \u20b91.93 billion (US$30\u00a0million) worldwide, the equivalent to \u20b92.73 billion (US$42\u00a0million) when adjusted for inflation, 2016 . It was the recipient of a number of awards, including four National Film Awards. Lage Raho Munna Bhai was the first Hindi film to be shown at the United Nations, and was screened at the Tous Les Cinema du Monde section of the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. The film popularised the term Gandhigiri. Vidhu Vinod Chopra submitted the film as an independent entry for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.   Murli Prasad Sharma alias Munna Bhai (Sanjay Dutt), a gangster who is in love with the voice of Janhavi (Vidya Balan), a radio jockey, devises a plan to meet her when she announces a quiz contest featuring the life and beliefs of Mahatma Gandhi, to be aired on 2 October, the birthday of Gandhi. To prepare for the contest, Munna's sidekick Circuit (Arshad Warsi) kidnaps and bribes a group of professors to provide the answers for Munna. After winning the contest, Munna is granted an interview with Janhavi wherein he presents himself as a professor of history and a Gandhi specialist. Janhavi subsequently asks Munna to present a lecture on Gandhi to a community of senior citizens who live in her home, called the 'Second Innings House.' To prepare for this event, Munna engages in intense study at a Gandhi institute. For three days and nights (and without food or sleep), Munna reads about the life and ideologies of Gandhi. It is during this period that the image of Gandhi (Dilip Prabhavalkar), addressed by his nickname \"Bapu\" (\"father\"), appears and offers help and advice to Munna. Gandhi encourages Munna to tell the truth about himself to Janhavi, but Munna resists this advice. With Gandhi's help, Munna succeeds in impressing Jahnavi and cultivates a new lifestyle based upon Gandhism. Munna starts to co-host a radio-show with Janhavi and Gandhi's image, guiding his audience to use Gandhigiri to solve everyday problems. The film has several subplots. One of the most prominent of these details the story of Lucky Singh (Boman Irani) and his daughter Simran (Dia Mirza). Lucky is an unscrupulous businessman who employs Circuit and Munna Bhai to conduct underworld activities for him. His daughter, Simran, is engaged to marry Sunny (Abhishek Bachchan), the son of the powerful businessman Kkhurana (Kulbhushan Kharbanda). Kkhurana is superstitious and his activities are controlled by his astrologer, Batuk Maharaj (Saurabh Shukla), whose particular use of numerology led Kkhurana to add an extra \"K\" to his real name (Khurana) as well as to the conclusion that the 'Second Innings House' would be the most auspicious place for Sunny and Simran to live. Maharaj also convinces Kkhurana to reject the marriage between Simran and Sunny when it is revealed that Simran is considered to be a manglik (an individual whose Vedic astrological makeup is believed by some to be devastating for marriage, mostly leading to the death of the spouse after a certain calculated period of marriage). Lucky appropriates the 'Second Innings House' by sending Munna to Goa (keeping him out of the way) and then blackmailing him to let the matter pass or risk losing his love Janvi. In response, Munna launches a \"non-violent\" protest to reclaim the house. He calls this protest \"Get Well Soon, Lucky\" and asks his radio show's audience to send Lucky flowers (red roses especially) to help him recover from the \"disease of dishonesty\". During this time Munna tells Janhavi the truth (via a letter he gives to her). Heartbroken, Janhavi leaves Munna. Munna receives another setback when he is tricked by Lucky into revealing his conversations with Gandhi before a public audience. At this conference, Munna finds that only after he has learned something about \"Bapu\"'s life can the Gandhi image talk about it, which serves as proof for a psychiatrist in the audience that Munna is delusional. Gandhi's monologue at the end of the film, however, questions this conclusion. Munna, despite these defeats, continues to use Gandhigiri, a decision that transforms Lucky, revives Janhavi's affection, and resolves Simran's marriage. Lucky Singh eventually becomes a student of Gandhigiri and is greeted by Gandhi's image not long after he has begun to study \"Bapu\"'s life. Immediately he calls for a photograph to be taken of them together; this perplexes the photographer, who cannot see the Gandhi image. The Munna Bhai series began after Vidhu Vinod Chopra agreed to produce Rajkumar Hirani's 2003 film Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. when no one else would (Hirani had worked as an editor on Chopra's 2000 film Mission Kashmir). They also collaborated on the script. Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. was a runaway success that prompted the duo to contemplate a sequel. The sequel was initially known as Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi and was later titled Munnabhai 2nd Innings before being given its current name. Hirani admitted in an interview that he felt the burden of expectation while writing the screenplay for Lage Raho Munna Bhai, as he had to create \"something to match\" the first film. Initially there was some effort to incorporate scenes or characteristics of the first film into the sequel (such as the idiosyncratic laugh of Dr. Asthana, portrayed by Boman Irani in the first instalment), but the risks of repetition were consciously averted. One of Hirani's goals in making the film was to revive an interest in Mahatma Gandhi, a figure whom he felt had been forgotten in contemporary India. To highlight this fact, Hirani recounted (during an interview) an incident with a chai-wallah boy (who brings tea to the crew) during production: The other screenwriter, Abhijat Joshi (who teaches in the department of English at Otterbein College in Westerville, Ohio), stated that he had been conducting extensive research on Gandhi, which inspired producer Chopra to involve Joshi in the creation of the second Munna Bhai screenplay. While writing the screenplay, Hirani and Joshi stayed together for more than four months. They developed scenes by going out for a walk and discussing the scene. They would not return home until they had created a scene that would make them laugh, or cry, or had some provocative thought. While there was a shortage of resources during the shooting of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., the crew did not encounter a financial crisis during the filming of Lage Raho Munna Bhai, as the team managed to receive whatever was deemed necessary (including a Jimmy Jib, a specific kind of camera crane, just for a single crane shot). The film was shot on location in and around Mumbai, with Goa as a backdrop for the \"Aane Charaane\" song. Only two characters\u2014those of Munna Bhai (portrayed by Sanjay Dutt) and Circuit (portrayed by Arshad Warsi)\u2014were retained from Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. Several actors from Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., appeared in Lage Raho Munna Bhai as different characters. Vidya Balan was chosen to play the leading lady as her voice was thought to be appropriate for that of a radio jockey. The actors used several techniques to develop their characters. Arshad Warsi (\"Circuit\") encountered some initial problems reviving his character from the first film. On the first day of the shoot when Arshad, \"said his first line, he didn't sound like Circuit at all. He sounded like Arshad Warsi speaking with an accent.\" Warsi admits that he had \"forgotten\" the character of Circuit and had to watch the DVD of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. three times before being able to film the scene correctly. Sanjay Dutt (\"Munna Bhai\") also confessed that he had to watch the first film eight to nine times to recapture the \"persona\" of Munna Bhai. In addition, Dutt stated in an interview that he did not read Gandhi's autobiography My Experiments with Truth as a preparation for Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Rather, he comments, his father, Sunil Dutt (who portrays Munna Bhai's father in the first film, Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.) and his mother (the late actress Nargis) were his role models as they \"were basically Gandhians. We were brought up with those values.\" Dilip Prabhavalkar, who portrays Gandhi, read Gandhi's works \"once again\" to prepare for his role. Boman Irani prepared for the role of Lucky Singh by spending time with Sardarjis (male Sikhs) in auto spare parts shops to research his role. Vidya Balan (\"Jahnavi\") met with a couple of radio jockeys and watched them at work. Each film in the Munna Bhai series features Munna and Circuit in a story that is comprehensive unto itself and is not continued or referred to in another in the series. Director Hirani has compared this format to the films of Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy, as well as to the James Bond series. Others have also likened the series to the work of Laurel and Hardy. Some, however, have negated this comparison, stating that the series is more akin to the Road to... \"buddy films\" of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. Hirani stated that his work was deeply inspired by the films of Hrishikesh Mukherjee. The interaction between the central characters of Mahatma Gandhi and Munna Bhai highlights concepts and ideas that draw upon the period of Colonial India and the Indian independence movement. Gandhi was a leader in this movement, challenging the British Empire's presence in India through the use of Satyagraha (non-violence). In the film, Jahnavi and Munna Bhai's non-violent protest against Lucky Singh serves as a metaphor for the Indian independence movement and the battle against the British Raj. The thematic attention to Gandhi's theories in Lage Raho Munna Bhai revived an interest in Gandhism in India under the new term Gandhigiri and \"made Gandhi suddenly hip\" with Indians \"staging nonviolent protests, starting Web sites, handing out roses to enemies and putting on peaked white caps from the Gandhi era.\" Arunabha Ghosh, in December 2006, noted in The Economic and Political Weekly that, \"Gandhi, the man, was once the message. In the India of the post-liberalisation brand, gandhigiri is the message.\" Amelia Gentleman of The International Herald Tribune/New York Times stated in September 2006 that: Mark Sappenfield of The Christian Science Monitor argued in 2006 that the film was appealing because, \"Gandhi gets his hands dirty. He appears as an apparition only visible to the wayward gangster, counselling him on how to help others deal with everyday problems.\" Swati Gauri Sharma suggested in The Boston Globe that what the United States \"needs is a film that encourages people to take up Gandhigiri, Kinggiri, or Kennedygiri. If it worked for Bollywood, it could work for Hollywood.\" After the release of the film, Gandhigiri-style protests began to take place in India. In 2006, farmers staged a protest with flowers in the Vidarbha region, and people who organised a protest in Lucknow claimed to have been inspired by Lage Raho Munna Bhai to use roses to convey their message. In Lucknow, students claimed to have been inspired by Lage Raho Munna Bhai to do volunteer work, planting trees \"to conserve nature which is bound to benefit public health.\" Mafia don Babloo Srivastava claimed to have been inspired by Lago Raho Munna Bhai to distribute roses as a \"message of love and peace\". In 2008, Indian Greenpeace activists delivered thousands of roses to Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Motors, to reconsider his plans of building a port at the nesting grounds of Olive Ridley sea turtles. The \"Send Pramod Muthalik a Valentine\u2019s Day card\" campaign in 2009 was inspired by the film. In the United States during July 2007, Aman Kapoor, founder of the Immigration Voice forum, initiated a Gandhigiri protest inspired by Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Over a three-day period, hundreds of flower bouquets were sent to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office by Indians who were legally in the US but caught in a green card backlog. On 17 July, the USCIS reversed the decision that led to the protest. Lage Raho Munna Bhai revived an interest in books about Gandhi. In particular, demand for Gandhi's autobiography My Experiments with Truth increased after the film debuted, including requests from prison inmates. In addition, due to its influence, the film was made tax-free in Mumbai. Screened on 10 November 2006 in the United Nations auditorium, Lage Raho Munna Bhai was the first Hindi film to be shown at the UN. The film was introduced by Shashi Tharoor, UN Under-Secretary General for Communications and Public Information. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama observed that, \"there was thunderous clapping at the high points of the film, like the pensioner shedding his clothes. The applause at the end of the screening was unending. A vibrant question and answer session followed with director Rajkumar Hirani, writer Abhijat Joshi and actor Boman Irani, who flew to the U.S. for the screening.\" The Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) noted that, \"an evening that had started with massive security arrangements in the sombre UN setting, concluded in a festive atmosphere in the lounge of the UN with diplomats from other tables joining in raising a toast for the film.\" The United Nations General Assembly announced on 15 June 2007 that 2 October, the day of Gandhi's birth (Gandhi Jayanti), was to be \"the International Day of Non-Violence.\" The Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, was given a private screening of Lage Raho Munna Bhai. After viewing the film, he stated that it \"captures Bapu's message about the power of truth and humanism.\" In a speech during his visit to South Africa, Singh said, \"I was heartened to see recently that back home in India the most popular movie this festival season is a film about a young man's discovery of the universal and timeless relevance of the Mahatma's message.\" Singh announced the creation of a new Public Services Bill to combat corruption in a press release dated 17 November 2006, and cited Lage Raho Munna Bhai as one of its influences. Lage Raho Munna Bhai was further screened at a global judiciary summit in Lucknow in December 2006. After viewing the film, Justice Kenneth Mithyane from South Africa commented, \"The movie has re-enlivened the non-violence philosophy practiced by Mahatma Gandhi who continues to remain close to the hearts of the South Africans.\" Fatima Chouhan, a young member of the South African parliament, noted that, \"'Munnabhai' will be widely appreciated in South Africa. I'm carrying a couple of video discs for my family and friends.\" It was part of the Tous Les Cinema du Monde section of the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. TLage Raho Munna Bhai was well received as the audience had lined \"up in long queues to catch the film that had been strongly recommended in festival reviews [...] not one person who entered the screening left before the end of the two-hours-thirty-minutes film.\" In addition, \"the screening of the movie at the festival saw people sitting on the aisles as the theatre was completely packed [...] there was also a big group of French students that clapped till the credits were finished.\" Several universities held screenings. It was shown on 27 October 2006 at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts. The screening was followed by a question and answer session with Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Rajkumar Hirani, and Abhijat Joshi. Filmmaker Gurinder Chadha attended and spoke at the conclusion of the question-and-answer session. The film was screened at Old Dominion University on 20 March 2007 (as a part of Old Dominion University and City of Norfolk ONFilm Festival), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lecture Series Committee on 23 March & 24 March 2007, and Harvard Law School on 3 April 2007 (as part of a series on nonviolence). The British DVD of Lage Raho Munna Bhai contains a bonus DVD which has a 98-minute five-part documentary on the making of the film, interviews with members of the cast and crew, and information on the creation of the song and dance numbers. It also has a special feature called \"Munna meets Bapu.\" Lage Raho Munnabhai\u00a0\u2014 The Original Screenplay was released in December 2009. Published by Om Books International in association with Vinod Chopra Films, it was launched at an event with the original cast and crew. The text includes an introductory note by Abhijat Joshi which details the drafting of the screenplay. It also includes a number of stills from the film as well as character profiles. Lage Raho Munna Bhai was an acclaimed film. Subhash K. Jha said that \"Munna and Circuit, arguably cinema's most adorable and roguish reformists since Laurel and Hardy go about the business of generating humour out of the pathos of the human condition. The sequences, all fiercely and famously path-breaking have us in splits [...] Watch the love-lorn Munnabhai answer a Gandhian quiz on a phone-in radio quiz with the help of kidnapped professors' it's one of the most comically animated sequences seen in the movies of the new millennium.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film four out five stars, calling it \"a sparkling example of qualitative cinema\" arguing that it \"not only entertains, it also enlightens.\" Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India observes that \"Vidhu Vinod Chopra gives the great Indian family one more let's-go-goodwill-hunting entertainer, even as director Raju Hirani proves that sequels needn't have the been there-done that feel...\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it four out of five stars and states: \"Like those good old-fashioned Hrishikesh Mukherjee films, it also reinforces the importance of human goodness and basic niceties. Even if you might argue that some of Gandhi's principles seem outdated today, you cannot help but cheer for Munna and his gang as they achieve the impossible with love and kindness. And that is where this film transcends conventional boundaries. It entertains you, yes, but it also makes you yearn for a perfect world. Judge it by any yardstick that you may, Lage Raho Munnabhai emerges a clear winner. Much of that credit must go to its actors who pull out all stops to make it an enjoyable ride.\" Poonam Joshi of the BBC gave four out of five stars stating that, \"everything about this film works [...] It's rare to see a film that bounces between humour and sentiment so seamlessly. And it is rarer still to see characters become etched in the memory so enduringly that audiences become almost protective of them. It's testimony both to the quality of the writing and the performances, that Munna and Circuit have taken on a life of their own.\" Vinayak Chakravorty of The Hindustan Times gave four out of four stars stating that it \"cleverly works its way around the obvious hurdle that almost all sequels face: The film recreates an original milieu without a hint of the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu downer. And that precisely ranks Munna Bhai 2 as one of the best entertainers this year.\" He commended the it for showing \"the heights Hindi cinema can scale despite staying within its masala parameters. Lage raho, guys.\"  Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian gave the film four out of five stars noting that, \"as western romantic comedies become more vapid and even stalkerish, this delivers a credible message of peace, while never forgetting to be magnificent entertainment.\" Shastri Ramachandaran of The Tribune wrote, \"True, there have been memorable films on Mahatma Gandhi by distinguished directors, namely Richard Attenborough and Shyam Benegal;one offering a respectful cinematic acquaintance and the other being didactic but inspiring. For all their earnestness, neither film stirred the popular imagination like LRM has done now.\" Vaidyanathan from BBC declared that, \"Lage Raho is not only as good as MBBS, but much better\" calling it \"a brilliant emotional roller coaster ride.\" Jeremy Page of The Times discussed its enormous popularity upon release and noted the \"serious point [the film made] about the need for tolerance, restraint and self-sacrifice.\" Finally, filmmaker Kabir Khan cited Lage Raho Munna Bhai as a model film for him as it \"had an issue, but it was never once in your face. Rajkumar Hirani kept it all so subtle and yet conveyed the message so well. It was as commercial as it gets and audiences too were thoroughly entertained. That's the way to make movies because it not just made all parties happy but also had a satisfied director at the end of it all.\" According to Tushar Gandhi, Gandhi's great-grandson, it introduced the philosophies of Gandhi to a new generation, adding that \"Bapu would've spoken the language of Gandhigiri if he were alive today. I really feel this film says something that needs to be told.\" Other critics offered more negative reviews. Ajit Duara argues in The Hindu that \"the accomplished cultural sophistication and political genius of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi has to be dumbed down to the astoundingly moronic levels of Lage Raho Munnabhai.\" Filmmaker Jahnu Barua was also critical, stating that \"Gandhian philosophy is serious business and Lage Raho Munna Bhai is not the right way to show it.\" Jug Suraiya of The Times of India wrote that \"thanks to Munnabhai, at best what exists of Gandhism is Gandhigiri, a watered down, Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People version of the original.\" Lage Raho Munna Bhai was the third highest grossing Bollywood film of 2006, earning \u20b91,250 million (US$19\u00a0million) gross in India alone and was rated a \"Blockbuster\". The film collected a further \u20b9498 million (US$7.7\u00a0million) during 2007 as the film enjoyed a tremendous golden jubilee run playing at a selected 210 cinemas until October of that year, being the only film to achieve this feat since the 1995 release Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. It was also financially successful overseas, earning \u20b970 million (US$1.1\u00a0million) gross in the United Kingdom, \u20b9112.5 million (US$1.7\u00a0million) gross in North America, and \u20b950 million (US$770,000) gross for the rest of the overseas proceeds, for a total of \u20b9222.5 million (US$3.4\u00a0million). Its total worldwide lifetime gross is \u20b91.93 billion (US$30\u00a0million) the equivalent to just over $40m when adjusted for inflation 2016. Lage Raho Munna Bhai is the recipient of four National Film Awards in addition to other awards. Some speculated that it would represent India as an entry for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. Although ultimately losing to Rang De Basanti as India's official submission, the producers submitted it as an independent entry. However, neither film received an Oscar nomination. Swanand Kirkire won the National Film Award for Best Lyrics in 2007 for the song \"Bande Mein tha Dum.\" On 25 February 2016, Sanjay Dutt was released from Yerwada Central Jail after completing his sentence (2013-2016) for illegal possession of firearms in 1993. Vidhu Vinod Chopra announced on 29 September 2016 that production on the third Munna Bhai film starring Dutt in the title role would begin in 2017.",

        "full_text": " Lakshya (English: Aim) is a 2004 Indian war drama film, directed by Farhan Akhtar and produced by Ritesh Sidhwani, starring Hrithik Roshan, Preity Zinta and Amitabh Bachchan in the lead roles. Hrithik Roshan plays the role of Lieutenant (later acting Captain) Karan Shergill, who develops from an aimless young man into an army officer. It is a coming-of-age story set against a fictionalized backdrop of the 1999 Kargil War.   Karan Shergill (Hrithik Roshan) is a young man from Delhi who has no goal or for his future. His father (Boman Irani) is a businessman and his brother is a successful individual living in America. His girlfriend, Romila Dutta/Romi (Preity Zinta), a student activist and reporter who espouses fashionable causes out of well-meaning sincerity, tells him he needs to find a goal in life. When a friend announces he is going to join the Indian Army, Karan applies to the Indian Military Academy (IMA) as well, despite dissent from his parents. Karan gets selected into the IMA, although his friend backs out. However, he is undisciplined and unused to life there. He keeps receiving punishments from the training team. Upset, he runs away from the academy, which causes Romi to break up with him. Karan finally comes to terms with his situation and makes his decision. He returns to the IMA, takes his punishment, becomes a focused, disciplined officer cadet and eventually commissions into the Indian Army. Karan is posted to the 3rd battalion of the Punjab Regiment, commanded by Col. Sunil Damle (Amitabh Bachchan). The battalion is stationed in Kargil, Jammu and Kashmir. Karan comes home on leave and finds out that Romi is getting engaged, but is recalled to his battalion due to an outbreak of hostilities in Kargil, and his leave is cut short. He reports back to his battalion, where he is promoted to the rank of acting Captain. His battalion CO briefs the officers on the latest situation. He reveals that a number of infiltrators have crossed the Line of Control from Pakistan and currently occupy a series of mountain peaks on the Indian side of the border. The battalion has been assigned to secure Point 5179, a crucial vantage point dominating the army's main supply line, the NH1D. The northern side of the mountain is on the Pakistani side of the LoC, the western side has a 1000-foot vertical rock cliff and the southern side has 3\u00a0km of empty ground with no cover. Therefore, the battalion decides to attack from the eastern side of the mountain. The first part of the assault is successful. The battalion destroys the enemy's screening units with Karan cited for his bravery in saving another officer's life. Meanwhile, Romi gets stationed to Kargil as a war correspondent, where she meets a changed Karan. Romi breaks off her engagement and tries to renew her relationship with Karan amidst the war. In the second phase of the assault, the battalion attacks the peak of the mountain but fails to capture it due to the strategic advantage and heavy weaponry the Pakistanis have. The unit suffers heavy casualties. Brigadier Puri (Amrish Puri) summons Col. Damle and gives him 48 hours to capture the peak \u2013 after that time period, responsibility for Point 5179 will be given to another battalion. Col. Damle then orders a group of 12 officers and soldiers (including Karan) to scale the 1000-foot rock cliff on the western side of the mountain and flank the enemy stronghold. They will be provided with artillery support from the eastern side. Karan realises that he has finally found his goal in the form of capturing the peak. The unit sets off on their mission and while moving through a grass field toward the rock cliff, they come under fire. The unit discovers a Pakistani mortar unit in the field and destroys it, but loses their commanding officer and a number of other soldiers. The team's radios are also destroyed, so they cannot communicate with battalion HQ. Out of the initial 12, only 6 remain. They decide to continue with the mission. They successfully scale the cliff and attack the Pakistani position during the night. Their assault is successful although Karan is wounded, and the team loses 3 more men. The next morning, Karan limps to the peak, where he plants the Indian flag and fires a flare, signalling to Col. Damle that they captured the peak. The film ends with Karan leaving a military hospital and reuniting with his parents and Romi. Production of the film began in Mumbai, India and the movie was shot at several different locations in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The scenes in Kargil were shot in Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir. Some parts of the film centered around Hrithik's military training were also shot at the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun. Actual Indian Army officers also participated in the movie. Seeing both the actors and officers in the same getup, at times actress Preity Zinta would get confused separating the actual officers from the actors. Lakshya netted around Rs. 230\u00a0million at the domestic box office. Lakshya grossed $5,859,242 worldwide including $753,600 from North American markets and $5,105,642 from other markets. In the U.S., it performed better, grossing $380,000 on 59 screens [approx. Rs.17.5\u00a0million] in its opening weekend with the per screen average being around $6,440. Lakshya was second movie for the director Farhan Akhtar after the success of Dil Chahta Hai. The film didn't fared as expected and it flopped in comparison to Dil Chahta Hai. However, with repeated telecast over the television, Lakshya has achieved a cult status among the audience that has arguably Hrithik Roshan's best performance till date. The film's soundtrack was composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. Shaan's \"Main Aisa Kyun Hoon\", picturized on Hrithik, is a laid-back, funky-hip hop track. \"Agar Main Kahoon\" is the love duet, picturized on Hrithik-Preity. The trio used harmonica for the track. The title track \"Lakshya\" is a techno-flavored patriotic song by Shankar, which is followed by \"Kandhon Se Milte\", another patriotic song with the vocals of Kunal Ganjawala and Vijay Prakash. \"Kitni Baatein\", a pathos song, is crooned by Hariharan and Sadhana Sargam. There are two instrumentals, \"Victory\" and \"Separation\". The trumpet portion from \"Victory\" has been used as the background music for their logo by Excel. The reception to the soundtrack ranged from mixed to positive. Joginder Tutja of Bollywood Hungama in his review, said \"Lakshya does have good music that is very urban and will appeal to the class audience. Going by the theme of the movie, the album is pretty balanced and has been composed with style that speaks of class.\" Planet Bollywood found the album to be \"as good as Dil Chahta Hai\". Subhash K. Jha described the album as \"daringly unusual sound with a show-offy kind of innovativeness\". Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com, however, remarked that, though the album was good, it was below expectations and \"lacked punch\".",

        "full_text": " Lamhe (English: Moments) is a 1991 Indian romantic drama movie directed by Yash Chopra and starring Sridevi and Anil Kapoor. The story was written by Honey Irani. It was inspired from the 1986 film Anokha Rishta. Lamhe was shot in two schedules in Rajasthan and London. Over the years it has been hailed as a classic and is regarded as a modern masterpiece , one of the best movies of Indian Cinema and possibly Yash Chopra's finest film. Sridevi received widespread acclaim for her performance in the film and won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Although a commercial failure in India, it became a success in the UK. Lamhe went on to win several awards and features in Outlook magazine's list of Bollywood's Best Films. It has been cited as Yash Chopra's personal favourite of the movies he has done. This was one of the last films that Dr. Rahi Masoom Reza scripted: He died a couple of months after its release. On the occasion of the Centenary of Indian Cinema in 2013, Lamhe featured among the Top Ten Romantic Movies of 100 years.   Virendra \"Viren\" Pratap Singh (Anil Kapoor) travels to Rajasthan with his governess, affectionately called Dai Jaa (Waheeda Rehman). He meets the beautiful Pallavi (Sridevi) and falls in love with her. However, she is older than he is, though this does not bother Viren. During a property dispute and a court case, Pallavi's father dies of a heart attack. She is shattered and goes into isolation. At the wake, Viren goes to console her, when she runs past him\u2014towards Siddhharth, the man she loves. Viren is heartbroken but, to fulfill Pallavi's father's dying wish, he arranges the wedding between Siddhharth and Pallavi. Allowing Pallavi to live her life happily, Viren leaves for London. One year into the marriage, Siddhharth and Pallavi are killed in an accident. She was pregnant at the time and gave birth to a daughter. The girl is named Pooja and is raised by Dai Jaa. Viren has a childhood friend, Prem (Anupam Kher), who knows that Viren's heart still pines for Pallavi. Over the course of time, and with much persuasion, slowly Viren hops back to reality by engaging himself in work in London. There, a colleague named Anita (Dippy Sagoo) falls for him. She knows about Viren's love for Pallavi and constantly tries to gain his attention. Viren visits Rajasthan from time to time, for Pallavi's death anniversary, and buys gifts for the young Pooja. He never meets her, remembering that she was born on the day Pallavi died. He never spends any time with her, which makes Pooja sad. A few years later, Viren returns from London and meets the grown up Pooja for the first time. He is shocked to see that she looks exactly like her mother. Pooja and Dai Jaa come to London for vacation, and there Anita discovers that Pooja is the image of Pallavi. This upsets her as she is afraid that Viren will eventually fall for Pooja. Pooja develops feelings for Viren whom she lovingly calls \"Kuwarji\". Prem also likes Pooja and understands that Pooja loves Viren. Though he likes the alliance, he is sceptical since Viren is living in the past. Later, Anita realises that Viren is over Pallavi and has fallen for Pooja. There are scenes when Pooja and her coming face-to-face over the topic of Viren. She finally confronts Pooja with the utmost respectful way of saying \"He's mine.\" Eventually, she insults Pooja as a kid infatuated by Viren and asks what relation Pooja is to Viren that she acts authoritatively over him. Pooja retorts by saying that if she is not related to Viren, Anita is not related to him either. This frustrates Anita leading her to lambaste Viren about having feelings for a younger woman. Pooja finds a sketch (which Viren has made of her mother) and misunderstands that it is a sketch of her. She dresses in old-fashioned clothes; when he comes home, she asks him to put \"sindoor\" on her since he loves her. Furious, he reveals to her that he had loved her mother and not her. Pooja is heartbroken and returns to India with Dai Jaa. Viren decides to marry Anita since he feels she and has been waiting for him for a long time. Pooja says that she will marry on the condition that Viren must marry before her. Pooja lies and tells Viren that she is already married. However, Pooja never marries for her love for Viren was too great. Viren understands that she is lying and lies to her: He sends her a marriage invitation to make her believe that he is now married. The resolution she took shows a heartbroken Pooja narrating a folk tale to an audience in a village show. After the show, Viren approaches a confused and wary Pooja. Viren reveals that he realised, after she left London, she had lied. He tells her that he is not married either. He says that he loves Pooja and not her mother. She runs into his arms and they are together at last. The music was composed by Shiv Kumar Sharma and Hariprasad Chaurasia (known together as Shiv-Hari) and lyrics were provided by Anand Bakshi. The song \"Kabhi Main Kahoon\" was made from melody used as background music in Yash Chopra's previous movie Chandni, also scored by Shiv-Hari. In the famous parody sequence, Waheeda Rehman danced to \"Aaj Phir Jeene ki Tamanna Hai\" \u2013 the superhit number from her classic Guide. The songs included on the official soundtrack are listed here: Lamhe is one of the few films that picked up the Filmfare Award for Best Movie despite its lacklustre business. Lamhe is also one of the biggest Bollywood hits in the overseas market and video circuit. Sridevi won much acclaim for her double-role as mother and daughter, winning the Filmfare Best Actress Award among others. It finds a place in the Times Movie Guide's Top 100 Indian films.[citation needed] It is in the Outlook magazine's list of All-Time Great Indian films. It has been cited as Yash Chopra's personal favourite his films. Times of India included it in its list of 'Top 10 Films of Yash Chopra' describing it as a tale of \"love transcending the boundaries of time and space\" while Rediff called it \"Quite easily one of his most definitive films, Chopra surpassed his own findings of romance with the insightful, lovely Lamhe\". Hrithik Sharma from El Viaje Reviews says \"The cinematography is a treat to eyes. Editing is crisp but with nearly 3 hours of run-time, it requires patience to watch the whole film. Only Yash Chopra could create this bold and unheard story in a way, that otherwise would have not been received well.\"  Sridevi played both mother and daughter cast in what iDiva described as \"another double role but it was unlike any played before\". Hailed by Rediff as \"one of the most remarkable films of her career...often considered a film way ahead of its time\", Her performance brought her much acclaim with BizAsia stating that \"Her rendition of both Pallavi and Pooja serves well in highlighting how versatile she is as an actress, playing contrasting characters in the same movie\". Speaking to Karan Johar about the 'Making of Lamhe', Yash Chopra revealed \"When 90% of the London schedule was over, tragedy happened. Sridevi's father died...She came back after 16 days and had to shoot a comedy scene...At that moment she forgot everything and gave a wonderful scene. I understood that is the secret of her success...Why she is what she is\". Sridevi's folk dance number 'Morni Baga ma' became a rage and was placed among the 'Top 5 Songs' of Yash Chopra by Hindustan Times. Over the years Lamhe has become a cult classic. Critic Rachel Dwyer wrote in her biography of the film-maker \"Yash Chopra's own favourite film, Lamhe ('Moments', 1991), divided the audience on a class basis: it was hugely popular with metropolitan elites and the overseas market, which allowed it to break even, but it had a poor box-office response (largely lower class, especially the repeat audience) because of its supposed incest theme\". The Hindu reported that \"With shades of incest, Lamhe caused more than a flutter and remained the talk of the town\" while Sridevi herself admitted in an interview with Rajeev Masand that she found the subject \"too bold\". Rediff described its failure as \"one of those bizarre, unexplained moments of cinema\". Won Won Nominated",

        "full_text": " Lekin (English: But..) is a Hindi drama film made in 1991, loosely based on a short story Kshudhit Pashaan by Rabindranath Tagore, and directed by Hindi lyricist Gulzar. It stars Vinod Khanna, Dimple Kapadia, Amjad Khan, Alok Nath, and Beena Banerjee, and featured a special appearance by Hema Malini. The film was produced by Indian singer Lata Mangeshkar, whose rendition of \"Yara Seeli Seeli\" won the 1991 National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer. The song also won film's lyricist, Gulzar, both the 1991 National Film Award for Best Lyrics and the 1992 Filmfare Best Lyricist Award. The film's music director, Lata's brother Hridaynath Mangeshkar, won the 1991 National Film Award for Best Music Direction. Other awards included the National Film Award for Best Art Direction for Nitish Roy and National Film Award for Best Costume Design for Bhanu Athaiya.   The movie takes place in the Indian desert state of Rajasthan, which gives it something in common with Rudaali, another off-beat drama set in Rajasthan that was released around the same time and also featured Dimple Kapadia and Amjad Khan. The plot centres around a government employee, Sameer Niyogi (Vinod Khanna), who is sent to Rajasthan to take inventory of items in the abandoned haveli (mansion) of the long-deceased Maharaja Param Singh (Vijayendra Ghatge). When he arrives in Rajasthan, he meets his old friend Shafi (Amjad Khan) who is a tax collector in the area and lives with his wife Sharda (Beena Banerjee). Sameer begins seeing what he thinks could very well be visions of another time and place, visions that he is shown by a beautiful woman he encounters by the name of Reva (Dimple Kapadia). But is Reva real or just a figment of Sameer's imagination? The drama that unfolds catapults Sameer into a different time and place and shakes his own personal foundation of reality, even as Shafi and his wife fear that their old friend may be losing his mind. In addition to the excellent performances and overall haunting quality of the cinematography, the plot twists and guest appearance of Hema Malini add to the film's charms. Also, as much as Sameer, Reva and Shafi, the desert of Rajasthan itself is a character in this film. Rolling sand dunes and long-deserted havelis create a sense of mystery and wonder, the stuff of dreams (or nightmares). Old commitments call across distances of not only places but also time and birth even, Lekin is such a saga. Lekin is the story of a soul of a woman, Rewa, caught in a time warp, somewhere between the realm of the living and the dead. She dies while she is trying to escape her long captivity and her ominous portending rape by the local Raja. She is caught in a storm in the desert as she is desperately trying to cross the desert to reach her paternal home. The winds blow in such a fateful way that her body and soul are left struggling under their force, till she succumbs and falls and then gets slowly submerged under the ruthless sands. The man, Sameer, to whom she appears, as a lost soul, time and again, is perplexed till he finally realises that she does not want to die, but sorrow and suffering have made her too scared to live. Rewa thus is the quintessential representation of many of us who have gone through a traumatic experience that has wrenched the life out of us. We want our life back, just as it was before the trauma, but are too scared\u2026.to live. We do not want to die but are too fearful of life itself. So like Rewa, we get caught in no man's land, flitting between the living and the dead, the real and the unreal, the concrete and the illusion, the fact and fiction, the conscious and the sub-conscious. And just like Rewa has the hope that Mehroo (the man who is supposed to be her saviour) will come and take her across the desert, we all harbour hopes that someone else will come and break this ever compulsive repetitive cycle of our pain and suffering and free us from its seemingly inescapable clutches. The moment we realise that the compulsive repetitiveness is the creation of our own mind, we free ourselves. The moment we realise that we are in a prison, the door of which is perpetually open, we free ourselves. The moment we live in the present, and stop ruminating on the past or worrying about the future, we free ourselves. The moment we realise that our soul has no constraints and no one can trap it or stunt it and that it transcends beyond all boundaries, we free ourselves. We all have to ourselves escape the deserts of our own minds, just as Rewa ultimately does, all by herself. The mind can be its own prison and its own salvation. It depends on us and what we choose it to be. So live every moment. That's all that is ours anyway. Government officer Sameer takes charge of the old fort and palace of Jasor, last ruled by one King Param Singh. En-route his journey to Jasor, Reva meets Sameer in the train in a mysterious way. She keeps meeting and disappearing, during his stay in Jasor. The mysterious appearance and disappearance initially shakes Sameer but reassurance that spirits exist from an expert on the field gives him an unknown inner motivation to find out the truth behind Reva, and his own self as well as find out the reason he is connected with this story. As the story is revealed by Reva herself, she is a spirit stranded in a period of time, attempting to cross the desert to meet her long lost sister Tara. The older sister, Tara, comes to Maharaja Param Veer's palace for a singing and dancing performance one night. The Maharaja eyes her malevolently and orders his men to not let her go out of the palace that night so he can rape her. Ustad Miraj Ali, the musical maestro in the king's court, who also happens to be Tara and Rewa's music teacher, learns of the king's plan. He warns the father of Tara and Rewa and advises them to run away from the town by crossing the desert. The King learns of this and imprisons Miraj Ali and Rewa while Tara's camel runs ahead in the desert but is never heard of. The cruel Maharaja also orders Tara and Rewa's father to be lashed till he bleeds to a near-death condition and then orders his men to put him on a camel's back and send him into the desert. The lecherous King then turns his attention to Rewa. He would wait until she would grow into a young woman. Rewa spends 8 years in captivity and one day the King wishes to sexually gratify himself with her. Ustad Miraj Ali along with the help of one of the king's servants hatch a plan to help Rewa run away from prison to save herself from the King. We learn that Rewa narrowly escaped the clutches of indulgent King Param Singh. Her mentor Ustad Miraj Ali gives an oath of the Holy Quran to one of his acquaintances, Mehru, who is supposed to help Reva cross the desert. But in the attempt to cross the desert, Mehru is caught by the King's men and punished by lashes and dropped to his village in a near-dead condition. Rewa gets killed in a severe desert sandstorm. She gets frozen in a moment of time. As events unfold towards the end, we come to know that Sameer is the rebirth of Mehru and that Rewa's elder sister, Tara successfully managed to cross the desert when her camel ran ahead. Tara is now older and has a daughter named after her dead, lost sister, Rewa. Ustad Miraj Ali also is alive and at Tara's house although he is very old. As soon as Sameer reaches Tara's house with the news about Rewa, Ustad Miraj Ali recognises him as Mehru and dies in his arms. Sameer also discovers a skeleton of Raja Param Singh in the castle dungeon. The 2 gold teeth in the skull help establish the identity of that skeleton as belonging to King Param Singh. It remains a mystery how King Param Singh died in the castle dungeon and how Ustad Miraj Ali managed to escape. Sameer eventually ends up fulfilling his commitment to help Reva's spirit not only cross the desert but also liberate her from the period of time in which she is stranded. All the songs from Lekin... were composed by Hridaynath Mangeshkar and the lyrics were written by Gulzar. Suniyo Ji Araj Mhario is based on the composition in Raga Vihanginee by Pt. Mani Prasad",

        "full_text": " Maachis (Matches) is a 1996 Indian Hindi film directed by Gulzar and produced by R. V. Pandit. The film stars Om Puri, Tabu, Chandrachur Singh and Jimmy Shergill in the lead roles. The title of the film is used as a metaphor that conveys that the youth of any nation are matchsticks that could get ignited due to the deficiencies in the political and policing systems. The film portrays the circumstances surrounding the rise of the Sikh insurgency in Punjab in the 1980s and traces the transformation of a youth from a boy next door to a dreaded terrorist bent on wreaking vengeance. Maachis tasted critical and commercial success. Gulzar's direction and the music of Vishal Bhardwaj were strong points. To this day, many songs from the film, particularly \"Chappa Chappa Charkha Chale\" and \"Chhod Aaye Hum Vo Galiyaan\" can be heard playing on FM radio or TV channels. Bhardwaj went on to become a movie director and has directed movies such as Maqbool as well as the highly lauded Omkara. \"Chhod Aaye Hum\" was the first Hindi film song sung by the now famous Indian singer KK. Maachis is a film about what atrocities can drive an ordinary human to do. It looks back at the Punjab problem and tries to figure out some of the root causes. It also warns that, in the future, there could be many more Punjabs burning and suffering for years.   The film is set in mid-to-late 1980s in the Indian state of Punjab which had been wrecked by a violent insurgency in the aftermath of Operation Blue Star, the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and the subsequent 1984 Anti-Sikh riots. The story is relayed by a series of flashbacks. Jaswant Singh Randhawa (Raj Zutshi) and his sister Veerendar \"Veeran\" (Tabu) live with their elderly mother Biji in a small village in Punjab. Kripal Singh (Chandrachur Singh) is Jaswant's childhood friend and Veeran's fiance and lives close by, with his grandfather. Their peaceful lives are interrupted by the police led by Assistant Commissioner of Police Khurana and Inspector Vohra, searching for Jimmy(Jimmy Shergill), who allegedly had attempted to murder Kedar Nath, a member of the Indian Parliament. Jaswant mockingly leads the police to his dog who was named Jimmy. Angered by his insolence, Khurana and Vohra take Jaswant for questioning but he fails to return for days. Kripal struggles to locate Jaswant, visiting various police stations in the area, while taking care of Jaswant's family. When Jaswant finally returns after 15 days, he has been badly beaten up by police which enrages Kripal. Unable to obtain help by any legal means to fight police brutality, Kripal sets off to locate his cousin Jeetay, who had ties with militant groups. Unable to locate Jeetay, Kripal instead encounters a man named Sanathan (Om Puri), whom he observes planting a time-bomb on a bus. Running into him again at a dhabha, Kripal asks a wary Sanathan to listen to his woes. Sanathan agrees to let Kripal travel with him on his truck being driven by the \"Commander\" (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) and carrying sacks of home-made bombs and two militants. Upon arriving at their hideout, Kripal explains his predicament and finds out that Jeetay was killed by the Commander himself for being a police informer. Fully aware of Kripal's background, family and his predicament, the Commander rebukes Kripal for coming to them as if they were professional killers and tells him to go kill Khurana himself, but that the group would protect him. Kripal slowly earns the respect of the rest of the group and Sanathan, who explains that he is not fighting for a nationalist or religious cause, but for his basic civil rights and self-respect. Sanathan says that he is fighting against a system that victimises innocents and de-values ordinary people. It is later learned that Sanathan is a survivor of the communal violence that occurred with the Partition of India in 1947, wherein he lost most of his family in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Sanathan claims that it is the ruling class that is trying to divide society by religion for political gain. Kripal rains with the group and plots the killing of Khurana. After a year, he assassinates Khurana in a busy marketplace. Before going into hiding, he visits Jaswant and Veeran one final time, both of whom are horrified at his deed. When Kripal returns to their hideout, he finds it empty. After a while of staying in hiding, he is contacted by a member of the group and is taken by the Commander to the group's new hiding place in Himachal Pradesh. The Commander informs Kripal that he is known to the police, who had taken Jaswant in for questioning again. Kripal slowly begins to realise that there is no return to a normal life and finds solace in the company of the rest of the unit, which is now preparing for a new mission and awaiting the arrival of a missile firing specialist. When thinking of applying for a local job, Kripal is warned by Sanathan that he is now a big-time terrorist in the eyes of the media and a means of promotion for police officers. One of the group members, Kuldip, narrowly escapes a confrontation with the police, sustaining injuries. Terrified by the experience, he pleads to Sanathan to let him go home, promising to emigrate to Canada. Sanathan reluctantly agrees and while the rest of the unit believes Kuldip is heading home, a bomb planted in his backpack explodes and kills Kuldip on his way home. Meanwhile, Kripal learns that one of his comrades, Jaimal Singh is none other than the Jimmy the police had been looking for. Soon afterwards, the missile shooter arrives and Sanathan introduces Veerendar. Kripal is shocked to find that Veerendar is none other than his fianc\u00e9e, Veeran. After they finally speak together alone, Kripal is horrified to learn that Jaswant, taken in for questioning after Khurana's murder, was beaten viciously and driven to commit suicide in the jail. His mother died soon after learning of this tragedy, leaving Veeran alone. After receiving daily visits from Inspector Vohra, Veeran decided to follow in Kripal's footsteps and try to reunite with him. Kripal and Veeran begin to grow close again. Veeran is a welcome addition to the household, bringing the simple joys of normal life to the band of outlaws and developing a close friendship with the others, especially Sanathan and Waziren. The mission is revealed to be a plot to assassinate MP Kedar Nath, who had survived Jimmy's assassination attempt, as he arrived for a visit to a local Sikh shrine. During their stay together, Kripal and Veeran decide to get married quietly, but Veeran quietly steals the cyanide pill from Kripal that each of the group members has and is supposed to use if ever caught by police. While visiting the Sikh shrine to begin reconnaissance, Kripal spots Inspector Vohra, who has been put in charge of security for Kedar Nath's visit. Kripal tracks Vohra to the house where he is staying but, while attempting to kill him, is caught by Vohra and arrested by police. Meanwhile, one of the group members spots Kripal entering Vohra's residence. Arguing that if Kripal had been loyal, he would have taken the cyanide pill to kill himself, Sanathan concludes that Kripal was a police informer. Sanathan also accuses Veeran of helping Kripal and orders her into house-arrest. On the day of the mission, Sanathan orders the group to move, and tells Waziren, who is guarding Veeran, to kill her. However, Veeran breaks free and kills Waziren. In the meantime, Jaimal and Sanathan execute the plot. Jaimal is killed while stopping Kedar Nath's motorcade on a bridge while Sanathan fires the missile to blow up Kedar Nath's car. On the run, Sanathan finds himself being tracked closely, not by the police but by Veeran. Veeran kills Sanathan and escapes. The film concludes with Veeran, who has not been exposed as a member of the group, visiting Kripal in prison. Here she gives Kripal his cyanide pill and later takes her own. The score and soundtrack of the film is composed by Vishal Bhardwaj with lyrics by Gulzar. The CD of the soundtrack also features several background pieces from the film. All lyrics written by Gulzar; all music composed by Vishal Bhardwaj.",

Madhumati won the National Film Awards for Best Feature Film in Hindi and nine Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Best Director, Best Music Director, Best Female Playback Singer, Best Dialogue, Best Art Direction, and Best Cinematographer. Janam Janam, the 1988 Hindi film starring Rishi Kapoor, is a remake of Madhumati. In 2007, Farah Khan and Shahrukh Khan made Om Shanti Om using some plot elements from Madhumati but did not credit the earlier film.   On a stormy night, Devendra (Dilip Kumar), an engineer, drives down a hill road with his friend to fetch his wife and child from the railway station. A landslide blocks their path and the friends take shelter in an old mansion off the road. Devendra finds the house uncannily familiar. In the large front room, he finds an old portrait which he recognises. His friend and the old caretaker join him, and Devendra, amidst flashes of memory from another life, sits down to tell his story while the storm rages outside. Anand (Dilip Kumar) had come to Shyamnagar Timber Estate as its new manager. An artist in his spare time, he roamed the hills and fell in love with Madhumati (Vyjayantimala), a tribal girl whose songs have haunted him from a distance. Anand's employer, Ugra Narayan (Pran) is a ruthless and arrogant man and, as Anand refuses to bend down to him like others, he incurs his wrath. Anand has enemies among his staff. Sent away on an errand, he returns to find that Madhumati has disappeared. He learns that Madhumati had been taken to Ugra Narayan and confronts him, but he is beaten unconscious by Ugra Narayan's men. While the men are taking Anand's body out of the palace, they meet Madhumati's father (Jayant) who has to fight for his own daughter's death. He does it and wins but dies lying on the road, while Charandas (Johnny Walker) hides and takes Anand's body to the hospital. Anand's life is saved but his mind wanders. One day, he meets a girl who looks exactly like Madhumati. She says she is Madhavi but Anand refuses to believe her and is beaten up by her companions when he tries to plead with her. Madhavi finds a sketch of Madhumati and realises he was speaking the truth. She takes the sketch and learns his story. Meanwhile, Anand is haunted by the spirit of Madhumati who tells him that Ugra Narayan is her killer. He appeals to Madhavi to pose as Madhumati before Ugranarayan and help him get a confession out of him and she agrees. Returning to Ugranarayan's palace, Anand begs permission to do a portrait of him. Next evening, with a storm brewing outside, Anand paints Ugra Narayan. At the stroke of eight, Ugra Narayan sees the pretend-Madhumati in front of him. Shaken, he confesses the truth. The police waiting outside the room come and take him away. Anand suddenly realises that the questions Madhavi asked Ugra Narayan were things she could not have known, as even Anand did not know, such as where Madhumati was buried. Madhavi just smiles and moves towards the stairs. The real Madhavi, dressed as Madhumati, then rushes into the room. She is late, for the car failed on the way. Anand realises it was Madhumati's ghost he had seen, not Madhavi. He runs up to the terrace, where the ghost beckons to him. Madhumati had fallen from the same terrace, trying to escape Ugra Narayan. Anand follows the ghost, falling to his own death. Devendra's story is over. But he says \"I finally did have Madhumati as my wife. In this life\u00a0\u2013 Radha.\" Just then, news arrives that the train in which his wife was travelling has met with an accident. The road is cleared, and they rush to the station. Devendra's wife, Radha (Vyjayantimala) appears, unhurt with her baby. Bimal Roy had previously signed on Vyajanthimala and Dilip Kumar for two films. The first, Devdas (1955), based on a novel, received much critical acclaim and a National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. However, it didn't receive much commercial success jeopardising Bimal Roy Productions: Roy needed a commercial success to survive. Madhumati was written on a story written by noted Bengali filmmaker Ritwik Ghatak. When Ghatak shared the story with Roy, he immediately liked it and started developing the film as a mainstream commercial venture complete with song-and-dance formula, stepping away from the usual themes of social realism as seen in his Do Bigha Zamin (1953), Biraj Bahu (1954) and Devdas (1955). Its re-incarnation, melodrama and commercial got him some criticism. Ghatak went on to write the screenplay, while Rajinder Singh Bedi wrote in dialogues. It launched in front of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival Theatre in Czechoslovakia. Dilip Kumar faced the camera, while Soviet actress Tatjana Konjuchova switched on the camera. Polish actress Barbara Polonska acted as Clapper loader. Madhumati was the first Indian film to be launched abroad. Unlike other noir films, shot indoors, Roy decided to shoot Madhumati outdoors and at a hill station. It had six-week schedule in Ranikhet, Nainital. Some scenes were shot in Ghorakhal, near Nainital. In those days there were no monitors, so when the negatives were developed, it was found that the most of the footage was foggy. Since a reshoot in far-away Uttarakhand wasn't possible, sets were created near Vaitarna Dam, Igatpuri, near Nashik. Art direction team, led by Sudhendu Roy, created fake pine trees, which were planted to match the location in Nainital. One particular scene where Dilip Kumar looks for Vyjayanthimala in the woods was actually shot in Igatpuri. Subsequently, a large part was also shot in Aarey Milk Colony, a small forested area in Mumbai. The foggy effect was recreated by employing gas bombs. However, due to its extensive outdoor shooting the film went over budget by Rs. 8\u20131\u00a0million. This added to the troubles of Bimal Roy Productions. Thus a film preview and lunch was organised for the distributors. Roy told them, about the financial crunch and that he had decided to forego Rs, 70,000 of his own fee as director to make up for the loss. Thereafter, all the distributors pitched in with money and made up for the deficit. Madhumati had its premiered at the Roxy Cinema near Opera House, Mumbai, received wide commercial success, and helped Bimal Roy Production make up for its losses. It became the highest grossing Hindi film of the year. Madhumati was the record holder for the most awards (9) received by a film at the Filmfare Awards for 37 years until the release of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge which won ten awards.The record of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was later broken by Black after 10 years which won eleven awards in total. It had multiple screenings since its release screened: 10th Bite The Mango Film Festival (2004), 4th Pune International Film Festival (2006) and Toronto International Film Festival (2011). All lyrics written by Shailendra; all music composed by Salil Choudhury. According to film and music expert Rajesh Subramanian, Bimal Roy had opted for S D Burman as the composer of Madhumati but the veteran music director voluntarily suggested composer Salil Chaudhary's name adding he would do a more apt job. Madhumati went on to become the source of inspiration for many later works dealing with the theme of reincarnation in Indian cinema, Indian television, and perhaps world cinema. It may have been the source of inspiration for the American The Reincarnation of Peter Proud (1975) (though that film was based upon a 1973 novel by Max Ehrlich) and the Hindi film Karz (1980), both of which dealt with reincarnation and have been influential in their respective cultures. Karz in particular was remade several times: as the Kannada film Yuga Purusha (1989), the Tamil film Enakkul Oruvan (1984), and more recently the Bollywood film Karzzzz (2008). The Reincarnation of Peter Proud and Karz may have inspired the American film Chances Are (1989). The most recent work to be directly inspired by Madhumati is the hit Bollywood film Om Shanti Om (2007), which led to the late Bimal Roy's daughter Rinki Bhattacharya accusations of plagiarism and threatening legal action against its producers. Other Indian films featuring reincarnation as a main theme include: Reincarnation has appeared as a main theme in the following Indian soap operas and television serials: Marking the celebrating its golden jubilee anniversary of the film, Bimal Roy foundation headed by Roy's daughter Rinki Bhattacharya, hosted a screening of Madhumati at the Globus Cinema in Mumbai on 11 April 2008. The occasion saw the reunion of film's cast, including Vyjayantimala. Madhumati, which released in 1958 with music by the legendary Salil Chaudhury and lyrics by Shailendra, was one of Bimal Roy's greatest commercial successes. Subsequently, his daughter published a book on the making of the film, Bimal Roy's Madhumati: Untold Stories from Behind the Scenes. In the 2013 Telugu film Iddarammayilatho, Allu Arjun and his band are seen playing \"Suhana Safar Aur Yeh Mausam\".",

        "full_text": " Mangal Pandey: The Rising (Indian title) or The Rising: Ballad of Mangal Pandey (international title) is a 2005 Indian drama film based on the life of Mangal Pandey, an Indian soldier known for helping to spark the Indian rebellion of 1857 (also known as \"The First War of Indian Independence\"). It is directed by Ketan Mehta, produced by Bobby Bedi, and with a screenplay by Farrukh Dhondy. The lead role is played by Aamir Khan, marking his comeback after he had gone into hiatus after Dil Chahta Hai (2001). It premiered in the March\u00e9 du Film section of the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. It was the fourth highest grossing film of 2005.   The story begins in 1857, when a large part of India was under the control of the British East India Company. Mangal Pandey (Aamir Khan) is a sepoy, a soldier of Indian origin, in the army of the East India Company. While fighting in the Anglo-Afghan Wars, he saves the life of his British commanding officer, William Gordon (Toby Stephens). Gordon is indebted to Pandey and a strong friendship develops between them, transcending rank and race. Gordon rescues a young widow, Jwala (Ameesha Patel), from committing sati (the act of following her deceased husband on to the funeral pyre); and afterwards, he falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Heera (Rani Mukerji) has been sold into prostitution, to work for Lol Bibi (Kirron Kher). There is a spark of attraction between her and Pandey and a liaison follows. Gordon and Pandey's friendship is challenged following the introduction of a new rifle: the Enfield rifled musket. Rumours spread among the sepoys that the paper cartridges, which hold the powder and ball for the rifle, are greased with either pig fat or beef tallow. The process of loading the rifle requires the soldier to bite the down on the cartridge, and the soldiers believe that this would cause them to consume pork or beef \u2014 acts abhorrent to Muslim and Hindu soldiers for religious reasons. Gordon investigates this claim, and is told by his superiors to assure Pandey and his men that the cartridges are free from animal contamination. Demonstrating his trust in Gordon, Pandey bites the cartridge, but soon afterwards discovers the truth. This seemingly trivial matter becomes the spark that lights the fire of rebellion among the sepoys. Mutiny breaks out, led by Pandey, and the situation escalates, fueled by the frustration of years of colonialism and subjugation. At one point, Pandey and Gordon engage involved in hand-to-hand combat as the latter tries to dissuade his friend from what he believes to be a futile exercise that will only lead to certain death. The Company moves to quickly stop the uprising by bringing in army units from Myanmar (Burma). Pandey is captured and set to be exectuted, despite the protestations of Gordon, who reasons that Pandey will be revered as a martyr and that his legacy will cause more protests. This turns out to be correct, and Pandey marries Heera in his jail cell before his execution as scenes of nationwide revolt against British rule are shown. In the aftermath, Gordon is listed as having joined the rebellion against the British Raj. The film ends with a montage of drawings of the historical rebellion and the narrator describes the progress of the Indian independence movement over the next century. The montage ends with documentary footage of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi leading the Indian National Congress during peaceful protests against British rule in the 1940s, eventually forcing an end to colonialism in the subcontinent. Mangal Pandey: The Rising had a bumper start at the box office but was declared average by Box Office India. It netted \u20b945.0 million (US$700,000) in Indian box office and grossedTemplate:How much? worldwide. Upon its release, Mangal Pandey received positive reviews. It received a 91% rating from noted critics rated \"fresh\" at Rotten Tomatoes. Film critic Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM gave four stars of five saying that it is \"A genuine attempt at bringing alive a great hero on celluloid, the film will only bring pride and prestige in the domestic market as well as on the international platform.\" Raja Sen of Rediff panned the film as being about \"cleavage and cliche\". Derek Elley of Variety commented, \"This is the classic structure of all the best historical epics, and though the film employs recognizable Bollywood trademarks, helmer Mehta's approach is more \"Western\" in its rhythms, pacing and avoidance of Asian melodrama. Musical set pieces are more integrated into the action, and the focus is kept tightly on the Gordon-Pandey relationship.\" Film scholar Omer Mozaffar of RogerEbert.com commented that this film is a study in imperialism and sensitivity, comparing the issue of the rifle grease to the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. The inciting event that leads to the Rising could have been avoided or quickly rectified. However, in the context of the situation, it was a larger issue of unrest due to negligent power brokers. In India, the Bhartiya Janata Party demanded a ban on the film, accusing it of showing falsehood and indulging in character assassination of Mangal Pandey. As an example, the BJP spokesman stated that the film shows Mangal Pandey visiting the house of a prostitute. The Samajwadi Party leader Uday Pratap Singh called in the Rajya Sabha for the movie to be banned for its \"inaccurate portrayal\" of Pandey. The Uttar Pradesh government criticised the film for \"distortion\" of historical facts, and considered banning it. Protestors in Ballia district, where Pandey had been a native, damaged a shop selling cassettes and CDs of the film, stalled a goods train on its way to Chapra (Bihar), and staged a sit-in on the Ballia-Barriya highway. The music was scored by A. R. Rahman with lyrics penned by Javed Akhtar.",

        "full_text": " Mard (English: \"Male\" or \"Man\" or \"Macho\") is a 1985 Hindi action film, starring Amitabh Bachchan and Amrita Singh and directed by Manmohan Desai. It was the highest earning film of 1985. The movie is remade in Tamil as Maaveeran.   The film opens in India. It is the early 20th century, when India remains part of the British empire. The opening sequence shows a group of British soldiers plundering an Indian fort and taking its riches by air to England. They are stopped by the valiant Raja Azad Singh (Dara Singh). Raja Azad Singh is immensely strong, and manages to lasso the light aircraft, subdue several English soldiers and recover the stolen jewels. Around this time, Raja Azad Singh's wife Rani Durga (Nirupa Roy) gives birth to a baby boy, who is named Raju. Raja carves the word mard (man, intending to convey strength and bravery) into the newborn's chest, noting proudly that the baby is smiling throughout, and can apparently feel no pain. (His words, mard ko dard nahin hota, meaning \"a true man feels no pain\", are a recurring dialogue throughout the movie.) The British commission conducts an investigation, led by a sympathetic and liberal Englishwoman, Lady Helena; the investigation uncovers the atrocities of the English troops and results in several officers being officially reprimanded. Lady Helena is a close confidant of Raja Azad Singh, and is generally supportive of Raja and the idea of India gaining independence from British rule. The English officers General Dyer (Kamal Kapoor) and Inspector Simon (Bob Christo) conspire with a snivelling, weak-willed local doctor Harry (Prem Chopra) to capture Raja. Harry sedates Raja; weakened thus, Raja is captured and imprisoned in a dungeon. Rani Durga escapes on Raja's faithful steed Bahadur. But she is shot, and the horse brings baby Raju to a local orphanage for safekeeping until Rani Durga can recuperate and reclaim him. The wife of a poor blacksmith spots baby Raju in the orphanage, asks after him and eventually adopts him. When Rani Durga returns, she is shocked to find her baby gone and she loses the ability to speak. The penniless Rani Durga eventually becomes a washer woman. The traitor Harry is appointed mayor of the town for his part in the capture of Raja. Raju grows up to become a strong youth under the care of the loving blacksmith and his wife. His day job is to run a tanga. One day, he happens across an arrogant and oppressive young woman who blithely runs her car over an old lady. Raju gives chase, intercepts the young woman, and compels her to apologise to the old lady. The young woman is of high birth, and her bodyguard Zybisko (Manik Irani) engages Raju, but Raju fends him off quite easily. The young woman turns out to be Ruby, the debutante daughter of mayor Harry. Ruby apologises. But she is charmed by Raju's rugged looks and candour. He initially refuses her advances to maintain his independence. But she eventually falls in love, changes his heart, and invites him to her birthday party. Harry and General Dyer continue their relentless quest for power. Their first move is to demolish the basti (slum colony) in front of Harry's mansion. Raju rallies the basti dwellers to oppose the demolition crew and picket Harry's mansion. Harry arrests Raju and is about to execute him when Lady Helena arrives on the scene. Lady Helena stops the demolition (citing lack of documentation), reprimands Harry, and releases Raju. Harry tries to buy off Raju, but Raju douses the cases with liquor, sets it afire, and uses the soot to blacken Harry's face. (No, it is certainly black money, for it burns black, he observes!) A frustrated Harry tries to have him shot, but Ruby intervenes, professes her love for the tanga wallah (tanga driver), and threatens to completely disavow her father if any harm should befall him. Unable to subdue or subvert Raju, a frustrated set of cronies (Harry, Dyer, Simon and others) fret and fume. The film introduces Danny (Dan Dhanoa) the son of General Dyer. Danny is every bit as corrupt, cunning and avaricious as his father and his cronies. Danny runs the nefarious operations beneath the outwardly clean, lordly and manorial life of General Dyer and mayor Harry. There are three such operations. First, there is a secret blood camp; basti dwellers that are infirm, aged or otherwise unfit are secretly abducted and their blood (all of it) is involuntarily extracted to supply British war campaigns elsewhere. Second, there is a slave labour camp where, again, basti dwellers are put to work (with no pay) on various civil and construction projects for the British empire. And finally there is Raja Azad Singh, still imprisoned, and a champion for the basti and for the workers in the labour camps. His primary duty is to turn, by hand, a massive flour mill; this mill is the only source of food for the camps. (Rani Durga, it turns out, is a washerwoman in one of these camps.) The camps grow in size, and Raja Azad Singh secretly plans to have them revolt; this becomes a growing concern for Harry. Harry and General Dyer decide the best way to remove Raju from the picture is to announce the engagement of Ruby and Danny. Ruby strongly opposes this and runs off with Raju. Danny gives chase with his men, and even tries to kill Ruby, but eventually brings her back to Harry. Harry is truly enraged. He threatens to kill Ruby if she ever disobeys him again. Danny devises a nefarious plot to get rid of Raju. As the first step in the plot, Danny captures the blacksmith, burns his hovel, murders his wife, and puts the blacksmith in a slave camp. (As she lays dying, she reveals to Raju the story of his birth. Raju cremates his foster mother and writes out a letter for his real mother, which he immerses into the river along with the ashes of his foster mother. The river carries his note to the camp where the blacksmith finds it and reads it out to Rani Durga, who immediately recalls her story. The blacksmith stages a stick-up to facilitate her escape, and she is ultimately reunited with Raju. The blacksmith, however, is killed.) Danny learns of Raju's lineage. Realizing Raju will attack the camp to free the blacksmith and Raja Azad Singh, Danny plays the second step of his plot and lays a trap. Raju enters the dungeon to rescue his father. But it turns out that Raja Azad Singh has been replaced by a masked impostor (Simon), and Raju is captured. At this point, Danny devises a fatal final step. He announces a gladiatorial sword fight between Raju and Raja Azad Singh where the winner will go free. Prior to this fight, he takes steps to ensure father and son are truly bloodthirsty for the other. Raja Azad Singh is brought to a blood camp where he sees Raju (actually a masked imposter) extracting blood from innocent citizens and swearing loyalty to the British; the Raja is incensed and swears to finish him off in the contest. Concurrently, Danny sends word (through Ruby) that the fighter opposing Raju will be a masked impostor and not the real Raja. Raju, in turn, announces he will not let his opponent leave the ring alive. And Danny forthwith arranges to have the real Raja fight Raju. The contest begins on the next day, and father and son are soon in a crazed sword fight. The duel takes a turn when the Raja spots the word mard on Raju's chest, and Raju notices one of his blows drew blood from the Raja's cheek. They quickly discover the truth, and keep up the appearance of a death duel until the Raja hoists Raju off the arena and into the viewing gallery. Raju plunges his sword into General Dyer, killing him instantly. Danny is infuriated. He orders his tanks to finish off Raju and the Raja. (Lady Helena and Rani Durga are strapped to the tanks, with British soldiers holding them at gunpoint.) Raju and the Raja seize horses and escape, with the tanks in hot pursuit. After a long chase and fight, Raju and the Raja overpower the tanks, rescue the ladies and engage the villains in combat. After a hard sword-and-gun fight, Harry, Danny and Goga are drowned in quicksand, and Raju and his father return victorious. The film ends with Raju and Ruby coming together and being reunited with Raju's real parents, on the dawn of India's independence movement. Mard was mostly shot in Ooty (near a golf links site belonging to Hindusthan Photo Films) and various locations in Karnataka, such as the Lalitha Mahal in Mysore and the Bangalore Palace. Anu Malik composed music for Mard. The Soundtrack album consisting of 6 tracks was released on 7 June 1985 on T-Series. All lyrics written by Prayag Raj (except where noted); all music composed by Anu Malik.",

        "full_text": " Mary Kom is a 2014 Indian biographical sports film directed by Omung Kumar and produced by Sanjay Leela Bhansali in association with Viacom 18 Motion Pictures. The film stars Priyanka Chopra in the lead role of the eponymous boxer, with Darshan Kumar and Sunil Thapa in supporting roles of her husband and mentor, respectively. Mary Kom depicts Kom's journey of becoming a boxer to her victory at the 2008 World Boxing Championships in Ningbo. The film marks the Hindi playback singing debut of Chopra, who provided her vocals for a song named \"Chaoro\" (a lullaby). Mary Kom was developed by writer Saiwyn Quadras, who suggested the storyline to Kumar when Kom was not a familiar name in India despite her numerous achievements. Kumar met Kom to ask her permission for the film, before her bronze medal victory at the 2012 Summer Olympics, which brought her recognition. Chopra underwent extensive physical training for three months to attain a muscular physique and learned Kom's distinct boxing style. Principal photography started in June 2013 at Filmistan Studio, where the boxing sequences were filmed. After plans to shoot in Kom's hometown, Manipur, were dropped due to safety concerns, Mary Kom was shot in Dharamshala and Manali, where a major portion of Manipur was recreated. The film premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, becoming the first Hindi film to be screened on the opening night of the festival. Made on a budget of \u20b9180 million, Mary Kom was released on 5 September 2014 to generally positive reviews from critics, with major praise directed towards Chopra's performance. Upon its release, the film recorded the highest opening weekend collection of all time for an Indian film featuring a female protagonist. The film was a commercial success, grossing \u20b91.04 billion at the box office. Mary Kom received several accolades at award ceremonies across India. The film won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and was nominated for Filmfare Award for Best Film and Best Actress for Chopra. Additionally, Chopra won the Screen Award and the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.   The film opens with Mangte Chungeijang Kom (Priyanka Chopra) in labour, walking towards the hospital with her husband, Onler Kom (Darshan Kumaar). Due to a curfew, they have difficulty finding a public transport and Onler is mistaken for an insurgent and beaten when he tries to find a vehicle. The film then shifts to a flashback in which Kom found boxing gloves in the remains of an air crash in 1991, which prompted her interest in boxing despite her father's disapproval. During an early fight, she chases a boy and ends up in a boxing gym. After realising that the coach of the gym, Narjit Singh (Sunil Thapa), was also the coach of the Asian champion Dingko Singh, Kom tells him about her boxing aspirations. He asks her to visit the gym for the next thirty days and says that he will only teach her if she is deserving enough. She starts visiting the gym, informing her mother but not her father. Days pass but her coach does not enquire about her. Due to Kom's dedication and stubbornness, Singh starts training her. Later, he suggests changing her name to Mary Kom. Kom challenges a local wrestler for money, in order get a household cow back, which the family had to sell off because of their financial troubles. This is where she meets the footballer Onler Kom. After winning the state-level championship, her father confronts her for keeping her involvement in the sport from him. When her father asks her to choose between him and boxing, she reluctantly chooses the sport. After watching her victorious 2002 Women's World Amateur Boxing Championships match on television, her father reconciles with Kom, and apologises to her for not understanding her passion for the sport. Meanwhile, Onler proposes to her and agrees never to ask her to quit boxing. After she wins the 2006 Women's World Amateur Boxing Championships, Kom agrees to marry him much to her coach's dissatisfaction. After the marriage, Kom gets pregnant and gives up her career to look after her family. Kom gives birth to twins and applies for a government job. However, she refuses the position of a police constable, feeling that as a world-champion boxer, she deserves better. It devastates her to learn that people no longer recognise her. Onler encourages her to restart her boxing training. She joins the gym again, leaving her husband to look after the twins at home. Her coach is still upset about her decision to marry, but Kom makes a comeback in the National Boxing Championship. Despite performing better than her opponent, she loses the match due to the apparent partiality of the judges. Kom throws a chair in anger towards them, resulting in a ban. She later writes an apology letter, and the official accepts it, but only after insulting her. Kom then convinces Narjit Singh to train her, as she thinks that he is the one who can get the best out of her. After completing her training, she participates in the 2008 AIBA Women's World Boxing Championships and reaches the finals. Meanwhile, Onler informs her about one of her children having ventricular septal defect. In the subsequent fight, Kom fails to defend herself. After a knockout punch from her opponent, Kom hallucinates about her husband and children in the audience. She regains her strength and fights back, winning the championship. On the podium while accepting the medal, she learns that her son's surgery was successful. Later, she is given the nickname \"Magnificent Mary\". The film ends with the Indian flag waving and the Indian national anthem playing in the background. The cast is listed below: During his work as an art director on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Saawariya (2007), Omung Kumar started writing two scripts simultaneously for his directorial debut. However, none of the films were made. He then asked writer Saiwyn Quadras to look for a female biographical subject for his first film, specifying \"a role that no actress would turn down.\" He added that he \"wanted to make a film that would be like the Mother India of someone's career.\" Historical personalities such as Rani Laxmi Bai and Queen Elizabeth I of England came up for discussion; however they did not inspire Kumar. Quadras put forward the name of five-time world boxing champion Mary Kom, who despite numerous achievements, was at that time an unfamiliar name in India. Kumar admitted that he felt disgusted after being told of Kom's achievements as he was unaware of her existence. After Quadras approached Kumar with the script for Mary Kom, Kumar decided to make his directorial debut with a film about Kom. Quadras, who was interested in sports, started writing the screenplay for the film in 2011, which took two years to complete. Quadras arranged a meeting with Kom via her manager in the year he started writing the script. Kumar went to Manipur to meet Kom and seek her permission to make the film. Initially, Kom was surprised by the development as the sport, especially women's boxing, was not well known in India. However, she was enthusiastic about the idea. When Omung came to me I was a five-time World Amateur Boxing champion. I was surprised why he would want to make a movie on me and thought he was joking or gone mad! Boxing, especially in women's section, is not so well known in India as it's hardly reported, and no one recognized me as Mary Kom. Research for the film was done through available sources, such as online information and newspaper archives. Kom's videos played a key role in the research. The writer also had several telephone and email conversations with her regarding her biography. In her interactions with Quadras and Kumar, Kom was forthcoming when it came to the details of her life, and had significant input in the screenplay. However, Quadras revealed that his biggest challenge was to make the film authentic and cinematic yet not documentary-like, so he wrote the film in a manner that showed the struggles Kom went through as a female sportsperson who had to confront opposition from her father, politics and making a comeback after a long career break. The film only shows the period from her early struggles and her comeback after motherhood. Her fifth World Boxing Championship win and the London Olympics were left out because of the contract that permitted a depiction of Kom's life up to 2008. The contract for the film was signed at that time when Kom had not even qualified for the London Olympics. In a 2012 meeting with Bhansali, Kumar told him about the film; he explained that this was a kind of cinema contrary to Bhansali's signature work. Still, Bhansali wanted to hear the story and was also enthusiastic towards the project. After hearing the script, he liked it and immediately agreed to produce the film. However, Kumar's colleagues were not sure if a film based in Manipur would be well received by the audience. This concern evaporated after the 2012 Summer Olympics, where Kom won a bronze medal. Her win also highlighted her previous achievements. After the news of the development of the film broke in the media, the makers clarified that the film was in development since 2011, much before the Olympics, and they were not influenced by her recent success. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Bhansali revealed that the story of the film was so inspiring, it touched his heart and described the film as \"a rare experiment\". He added \"Not many films are based on biopics of living people. I am proud that I am part of this film.\" Chopra was Kumar's and Bhansali's first choice for the title role. In early November 2012, media reports suggested that Chopra entered negotiations to star in the film, which she denied initially. Later in that month, it was confirmed that she had been cast for the part. She was initially skeptical about the film due to the demanding nature of the character, which included training, muscle building, and learning the sport. She later agreed to the film because of Kumar's confidence in her. After Chopra was cast in the title role, Mary Kom thought of Chopra as the \"perfect choice\" for the role. In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Kom described Chopra as the best actress to play the role, adding that her body was well structured, like that of a boxer. In contrast, it took the casting directors Shruti Mahajan and Parag Mehta several months of auditions to finalise the appropriate supporting actors for the film. In May 2013, a wide section of the media reported that Danny Denzongpa was approached to play Kom's coach Narjit Singh in the film. Instead, Sunil Thapa was cast for the role of Kom's coach. Darshan Kumar was finalised as Kom's husband, footballer Onler Kom, after a series of auditions which included three different looks representing three different stages in his life. Robin Das, a National School of Drama professor, was cast in the role of Kom's father. Before filming began, Chopra prepared for three months. The preparations included building the physique of a boxer and learning the sport. Samir Jaura, who previously trained Farhan Akhtar for Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (2013), was brought in to train Chopra. She, at that time, was busy dubbing for Krrish 3 (2013), and filming for Gunday (2014). It was then decided that Jaura would accompany her to film shoots, so that continuity in training could be maintained. Though he did not get a chance to meet Kom, he used her videos to study her body language and prepare a workout plan for Chopra, who started training in April 2013. She found it hard to train vigorously to attain a boxer's physique. She was put on a low-carb, high-protein diet. \"As a girl it was very difficult to build those muscles. I had to build in three months what Mary did in 15 years\", she said in an interview with Deccan Chronicle. Chopra got a fifteen-day break from her other commitments to train for the film. She relocated to her bungalow in Goa, where she would train for five hours a day. After completing workouts, which included weights and circuit training, she insisted on training for boxing. Later, boxing was made a part of her daily workout. She was trained by Kom's coaches to learn her distinct boxing style. Chopra explained that she did not have to act like a boxer, but had to become one and said \"To learn boxing was a religion. Today, I can play the sport as I know the rules, body posture, foot work, I can hit, I can defend. I know the game.\" Chopra found Mary Kom a very special and personal film due to the inspiring theme. She revealed that she channelled the grief of father's death into the film: \"I started this film at the hardest point in my life, four days after my father passed away. All my grief, everything, I have shoved into this movie. A part of my soul has gone into it.\" In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Chopra revealed that since she could not look like her, she did not try to imitate Kom as her main focus was to represent Kom's spirit and personality. In July 2013, Chopra visited Kom's home town of Manipur to learn more about her life. As part of her research, Chopra stayed with Kom and her family for three to four days, and went to her boxing academy and church to learn more about her. Kom stated, \"When she came to Manipur, she knew about boxing so I gave her tips as a mother and a wife, how I went about managing my home and profession, how I live with my family\u00a0\u2013 basically she got to know aspects of my family life.\" Darshan Kumar described his character as an \"encouraging husband\", who is the pillar of strength in Kom's life. He found the character challenging due to contrasting personalities. Unlike Chopra, Kumar did not meet Onler Kom before the film. He mainly made use of the videos which Kom had provided to the makers, which helped him understand the nuances of his character. For the role, he had to learn the Manipuri accent, which was difficult for him being a Punjabi. Kumar lost 12 kilogram to look the part, and followed a strict, grilled chicken and oil-free fish protein diet for three months. The production design was handled by Kumar's wife Vanita. After plans to shoot in Manipur were dropped because of safety concerns, extensive research was done to find locations similar to Manipur. Their search ended in Himachal Pradesh, Manali, where a major portion of the state was recreated. Vanita used a real structure instead of a set to show Kom's childhood home in Kangathei. She recreated the look and feel of Manipur in Dharamsala and Manali. During the search, Vanita found two houses that were similar to those where Kom spent her childhood and lived after her marriage. For authenticity, the house was filled with items similar to those found at Kom's house such as indigenous short stools and woven curtains sourced from Manipur. Since Kom has a separate trophy room where all her awards are kept, a similar room was created. Quotes from the Bible were added on the walls. A 19th-century church in Dharamsala was chosen for the wedding sequence. Vanita noted that \"the cinematic realism, was a different experience from the grandeur of Bhansali's sets.\" However, she found it difficult to recreate the run-down gym where Kom was trained. A place was chosen with minimal facilities and water leaking onto the walls. She revealed that the sets had to feel authentic rather than artificially created. The costumes were designed by Isha Mantry and Rajat Tangri. Tangri visited Manipur to study fabric used in local clothing. Tangri used photographs from Kom's childhood to create clothing which ranged from traditional to sporty and athletic attires. For Kom's wedding sequence in the film, Tangri created an exact replica of her wedding gown. Hollywood-based Mark Garbarino was Chopra's makeup artist. At first, they wanted her to look exactly like Kom by using prosthetic makeup. Chopra did a prosthetic test in the United States which included heavier eyelids for a more East-Asian look. However, the final result did not appeal to the makers. Also, the prosthetic would not hold during filming of the heavy-action boxing scenes. It was later reported that Chopra's look would be created post production by using visual effects. However, the results were unsatisfactory and hence this idea was also dropped. Chopra said \"We tried a bunch of stuff \u2013 Visual effects, prosthetics, makeup, [but] it looked too gimmicky. That's when we decided to go with just carrying the essence of the film, rather than the outer, cosmetic part.\" Later, Uday Shirali, Chopra's makeup artist since Agneepath (2012), was hired. For creating boxing scars, makeup artist Subhash Shinde was employed. His biggest challenges were to make the fight marks look as realistic as possible as it required a lot of time and detailing. He stated, \"Every punch or scar needed to look real, change colour and age with time on screen, and shouldn't look like they were created using makeup.\" He did some research by visiting hospitals to understand more about skin injuries. Principal photography began in June 2013 at Filmistan, Mumbai. Hindustan Times reported that the set was ready at Filmistan studio, but following Chopra's father's death, the plans for shooting were put on hold. To make the boxing scenes authentic, some of the crew members, including Kumar himself, learnt boxing to get the necessary understanding of the sport to film the fight scenes. Initially, the makers had planned to use actors and teach them boxing to film the boxing scenes. They eventually realised that it would not be feasible and would be time-consuming. They also thought that if both Chopra and her opponents were not real boxers, it would not look convincing enough. Professional boxers were then employed to film the boxing sequences for giving a more natural feel and convincing look. Filming boxing scenes was difficult for Chopra as she got hurt several times; she says, \"They are real boxers and they don't know how to fake a punch, they had to really hit you. So I had to get hit a lot and that was really hard.\" Robert Miller, the sports coordinator for films such as Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Chak De! India (2007), was hired to choreograph the fight sequences. The second schedule commenced in Manali in late March 2014, after Chopra finished her other film commitments. Before filming, Chopra had to re-train herself to build muscles. Bhansali planned an elaborate schedule for her, which would ensure that her physicality and agility were suitable enough for the role. While filming a sequence in a marketplace, more than ten thousand people gathered on the sets. Due to limited security arrangements, the crowds became uncontrollable in what was not believed to be a heavily populated area. When Chopra stepped out of her van, some fans tried to approach her, causing the general loss of control. As a result, the shoot was cancelled and the whole crew had to leave. Filming in Manali continued till early April 2014, before shifting to Dharamsala. While filming fight sequence in Dharamsala, Chopra suffered an eye injury, which the makeup team exaggerated for effect. The filming in Dharamsala continued till 19 April 2014. Cinematographer Keiko Nakahara used a hand-held camera during the shooting of the film. The filming was done in 57 days over the course of two years. The soundtrack of the film consists of seven original songs composed by duo Shashi Suman and Shivam, with lyrics by Prashant Ingole and Sandeep Singh. Chopra made her Hindi playback singing debut with a lullaby, \"Chaoro\". The soundtrack was released by Zee Music on 13 August 2014. The song \"Salaam India\" was the official song at the 2014 Asian Games, held in South Korea. The Times of India noted that the soundtrack is both, \"inspirational and soul-stirring\", describing the opening track \"Ziddi Dil\" as a \"clear winner that could lift anyone's spirits in a time of distress.\" Bollywood Hungama gave it a rating of 3.5 out of 5, and said that the composers did justice to the theme of the film. In an another positive review, Rediff.com's Joginder Tuteja called it \"motivational\", and wrote that \"Mary Kom's soundtrack may not be an instant chart-buster, but it holds its own.\" The Koimoi review stated that all the songs on the album are an \"absolute delight to hear\", concluding, \"[t]he Mary Kom album is a good blend of romantic and inspirational numbers. The classic mix of excellent singers by composers Shashi Suman and Shivam has given the album some great numbers.\" The Financial Express also praised the soundtrack and composition. The first poster for the film was revealed on 14 July 2014 by Chopra through her Twitter account. It portrayed a muscular Chopra as Mary Kom in sports clothing, with her hair tied in a pony tail, punching a bag. It received positive feedback from film critics, industry professionals, and audiences alike. Sweta Kaushal of the Hindustan Times noted that \"[w]ith well-built muscles and a completely toned body, Priyanka looks fierce in the poster where she is posing with a punch.\" The poster went viral on social media, with the hashtag \"#MaryKomFirstLook\" trending in India and worldwide. On 15 July, Chopra tweeted another poster for the film, which was also well-received; the final poster was released on the same day. The first teaser was released on Chopra's birthday, 18 July. It showed the actor as Kom, getting ready for her boxing match with the tagline \"Most Champions Make Their Name. She Made History\". The trailer release was highly anticipated, with media reporting that it would be unveiled on 24 July. However, it was released the day before at an event on 23 July and was well received by the audience, media and critics. On 27 August, a special screening was held for selected members of media, trade and critics, where 20 minutes of raw footage from the film was previewed, creating a positive buzz. As part of their promotional strategy, Bhansali Productions released a doll, which looked like Chopra as Kom. The film was originally scheduled for release on 2 October (on Gandhi Jayanti), however, it was announced that the film was postponed to an uncertain date to revamp the film to feature more events surrounding Kom's life. The media reported that the makers were working on two different versions, a longer version for the Indian market and another for the international market. After the uncertainty of a release date for a month, it was announced that the film would be released on 5 September (Teacher's Day), clashing with Daawat-e-Ishq, which starred Chopra's cousin, Parineeti. Yash Raj Films requested that Bhansali shift the release date, which he refused due to previous release date changes of the film and the ongoing promotional activities. Later, Yash Raj Films postponed the Daawat-e-Ishq release date by two weeks. On 4 September, Mary Kom had its world premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, where it became the first Hindi film to be screened on the opening night of the film festival. It was initially released to 1500 screens worldwide. The film was released in overseas markets by Eros International as part of a four-film deal between Eros and Viacom 18 studios. The rights to television broadcasting belonged to Viacom18's flagship general entertainment channel Colors. The film was not released in Kom's home state of Manipur because of the ban on Bollywood films by the Imphal-based separatist militant group, Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF) since 2000. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Kom expressed her sadness that people from her own state would not be able to see her biopic. However, unauthorised DVDs and VCDs flooded the state, with the DVD format in great demand as the only option for native people to watch the film. Made on a budget of \u20b9180 million including production, prints and advertising, and marketing, Mary Kom earned \u20b9200 million, and before release recouped more than its cost from brand tie-ups. The film made profits before the release. Partnership was arranged in a way that the products from brands were either showcased in the film or the brands promoted the film in their advertising. The satellite rights of the film were sold for \u20b9140 million and music rights for \u20b930 million. The film was released in DVDs on 15 October 2014 across all regions in a one-disc pack in NTSC format. Distributed by Shemaroo Entertainment, it contained behind-the-scene footage and deleted scenes. The VCD and Blu-ray versions were released at the same time. The Mary Kom Blu-ray is the first Blu-ray title in India to feature a Dolby Atmos soundtrack. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with Chopra receiving critical acclaim for her performance. Subhash K. Jha awarded the film 5 stars out of 5, describing it as \"a motivational masterpiece\" and said \"From first frame to last it grips your senses and irrigates the parched corridors of your heart like very few bio-pics in recent times. Debutant director Omang Kumar weaves seamlessly in and out of Ms Kom's remarkable life creating a work that is as dramatic as Mehboob's Mother India and as inspiring as Attenborough's Gandhi.\" Rediff.com rated the film 4.5 out of 5, noting it as a victory for its protagonist Chopra, scriptwriter Saiwyn Quadras, and director Omung Kumar and writing, \"Mary's story is delivered with a sincerity that makes it irresistible.\" Sonia Chopra from Sify described the film as a \"thrilling ringside view\", saying that \"Mary Kom is an important film that's hugely inspiring. But more importantly, it's also great fun to watch.\" The Times of India gave the film a rating of 4 stars out of 5 calling it as Bollywood's answer to Academy Award-winning film Million Dollar Baby (2004). Bollywood Hungama gave it 4 stars, stating \"Omung Kumar certainly deserves an ovation for having shown the guts to make a biopic on Mary Kom, something which will surely go down in the history of exemplary biopics on Indian celluloid.\" Namrata Joshi from Outlook rated the film with 3 stars out of 4 and commented on the simple, unpretentious storyline that dramatised important events from the champion's life. Bhawana Somaaya rated the film 4 stars out of 5, stating that film was not solely a medium for entertainment and that the main purpose of Mary Kom was to depict courage, stability, truth and innocence. The Economic Times gave a rating of 4 stars out of 5, noting that the film is well on its way to being one of the most praised sports-based films since Chak De India and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and wrote \"This is one of those boxing movies which is much more than boxing. It takes you to a place which is beyond ruptured cheeks, cracked jaws, and fractured ribs of the protagonist.\" Writing for Hindustan Times, Anupama Chopra rated the film 3 out of 5 noted it as a \"worthy attempt\" and said that the film had sincerity and was crafted with care. Mayank Shekhar also rated the film with 3 stars, stating that his biggest concern before getting into the film was that the film-makers (Sanjay Leela Bhansali) would excessively \"Bollywood-ise\" Kom's story. He commented that this fear was \"thankfully\" not found. On the contrary, Business Standard criticised the film for not showing enough about boxing in general rather than Kom in particular. It stated that \"while Mary Kom is entertaining, it should have aspired to be more.\" Rajeev Masand wrote that the film was \"watchable, but never great like it should've been\". Shubhra Gupta from The Indian Express gave a rating of 2.5, noting that the \"Film gets bloated by extraneous songs\", and criticised the product placements calling them a \"distraction from the story.\" The India Today reviewer, Rohit Khilnani, criticised Kumar's direction and wrote \"The story is predictable from the word go and there are absolutely no surprise elements. A lot could have been done with such a strong protagonist but the director doesn't experiment.\" Sudhish Kamath from The Hindu criticised the film, saying it should be watched for Chopra, but that the script was generic and predictable, and the plot was actually manipulative. On its opening day, the film earned \u20b985 million, marking the biggest opening collection for a women-centric film.

        "full_text": " Mera Naam Joker (translation: My Name is Joker) is a 1970 Indian Hindi drama film directed by Raj Kapoor. The screenplay was written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas. This film was the debut of Rishi Kapoor. Mera Naam Joker is a film about a clown who must make his audience laugh at the cost of his own sorrows. The film is considered to be one of the lengthiest films of Indian cinema. After Sangam became a blockbuster, Mera Naam Joker was highly anticipated as it was under production for six years and was heavily publicized to be loosely based on Raj Kapoor's own life. Upon release the film turned out to be a critical and commercial disaster putting Kapoor into a financial crisis. The film was heavily panned for its length and plot. However, over the years, the film has gained a cult status  and is regarded as a classic today. Both audience's and critics' response has turned highly favorable with the passage of time. An abridged version was released in the 1980s and had a highly successful run at the box office. Raj Kapoor termed this his favorite film and described it as having deep philosophical depth and meaning. The film is regarded as one of Kapoor's finest works today with film experts labeling it as a 'misunderstood masterpiece'.   Mera Naam Joker is the story of Raju, considered the best circus clown ever. Ever since Raju's father died in an accident during his performance, Raju's mother had been repulsed by the circus. As luck would have it, Raju had a natural affinity towards the circus world. The film traces Raju's journey from his childhood to the day of his last performance. The first chapter is about the adolescent Raju (Rishi Kapoor) and deals with his infatuation with his teacher Mary (Simi Garewal). She gives him confidence in himself, and he discovers the world of femininity and desire. She is older than him. He attends her wedding in a state of false merriment. Mary's lessons nevertheless aren't lost: Raju comes to realise that he was born to make the world laugh, despite his own troubles. In a scene Mary takes off her wet clothes in a bush by a lake and this is secretly eyed by Raju, in this scene her white bra and panties are seen. Later lying in bed in house Raju imagines that Mary is fully naked, the naked scene shows that a woman is waving her clothes by a lake and her nudity is shown from behind, one of her breasts is partially shown and buttocks are shown clearly. It is not confirmed that the nude scene was done by Simi herself or by a body-double. After his first heartbreak, the story follows adult Raju (Raj Kapoor) who has found work with Gemini Circus as a clown. His dream materialises! The circus is owned by Mahendra Singh (Dharmendra) who has understood Raju's potential and hires him. The circus hosts a visiting group of artists from Russia, and he falls in love with Marina (Ksenia Ryabinkina), the lead trapezist. Despite the language barrier they become close, and Raju half hopes that they might live together. But he faces heartbreak once again when the circus ends and Marina returns to Russia. It is in this chapter that Raju's mother dies during his performance, watching him perform the very stunts which caused her husband's death. In the final chapter, Raju has left the circus and wanders aimlessly. One day he meets Meenu (Padmini), an orphaned girl who has ambitions of becoming a famous actress. Meenu and Raju set up an association, start a small circus business and later move on to the theatre. They are quite successful, but their collaboration ends when she is offered a role in a film. She leaves him, and he realises she has used him in her pursuit of success. Raju always carries a clown doll which belonged to his father. Every time he falls in love, he gives away his beloved doll, only to see it come back to him. The doll is used as a metaphor for Raju's simplistic heart where there is room for everyone. At the end of the film, Raju is shown doing his final act, as promised to Mahendra. He invites the three ladies he was in love with, to watch his last performance. He also reassures the audience that he will soon be back with more to make his audience laugh again. Mera Naam Joker was under production for six years, with Raj Kapoor investing much of his own personal fortune. Upon release, Mera Naam Joker was widely derided for its length and the experimental nature of its plot, and became a box office bomb. In later years, however, it gained classic status. The movie had a running time 255 minutes with two intervals. The international DVD release from Yash Raj Films Home Entertainment runs for 233 minutes (224 with the disc's PAL speed-up), while the Indian DVD by Shemaroo Entertainment is heavily cut at 184 minutes. Mera Naam Joker is the second Hindi film to have two intervals, the first being Sangam (1964).",

The film stars Anil Kapoor, Meenakshi Sheshadri, Nutan, Amrish Puri, Javed Jaffrey (in his debut film), A. K. Hangal, Iftekhar, Kushboo and Parikshat Sahni. The films music is by Laxmikant Pyarelal.   The story begins with a happy lower-middle-class family \u2013 Arun Verma (Anil Kapoor) an 8-year-old boy, his sister Komal Verma (Khushboo) a 5-year-old girl, his mother (Nutan) and his father (Girish Karnad) \u2013 living a peaceful life. Arun's parents teach their children through the famous title song \"Zindagi Har Kadam Ek Nayi Jung Hai, Jeet Jayenge Hum, Jeet Jayenge Hum Tu Agar Sang Hai\" which means that life is full of problems at every step and still we will overcome all these if we are together. Arun's father is trapped in a murder case. A famous criminal lawyer G.D. Thakral (Amrish Puri) proves him guilty, and he is sentenced to be hanged by the court. Pleas by Arun's mother fail to convince Thakral to be truthful and spare her husband. Thakral asks her to give evidence for his innocence, to which she sadly quotes \"Jiske paas koi sabut, koi gavanh nahi hote kya we begunah nahin hote\" (\"one who does not have any proof or witness of innocence, are they not innocent?\"). Thakral was adamant to let her husband be hanged. He was hanged as per court's decision. His mother becomes mentally unstable from shock and is sent to a mental institution. Later Advocate Gupta (A.K. Hangal), the lawyer who defended Arun's father, finds out that Thakral had known all along that he was innocent, but only wanted him to be hanged. Arun finds out that Thakral abused the law. Arun's house and all his property is auctioned off by the court. Arun and his sister are not offered help. He grows up with the seeds of revenge in his heart. He becomes a successful defence lawyer and keenly follows every case of Thakral so that some day he can stand up in court against the unbeaten Thakral and beat him. One day Geeta Srivatsav (Meenakshi) comes to him and asks him to fight the case of her sister, Dr. Asha Mathur (Bina) who is accused of killing a patient on duty with her medicine, which she gave from her purse. Arun refuses saying that if she can produce even an iota of evidence of her sister being innocent he will fight for her. Geeta replies coincidentally the same sentence \"Jiske paas koi sabut, koi gavanh nahi hote kya we begunah nahin hote.\" Arun is instantly reminded of his mother's pleadings before Thakral. Geeta storms out of his office, but Arun is convinced to take the case. He meets Asha Mathur in police custody. He learns from her that on that fateful night she got a call from her ward assistant that her patient is in the ICU and needs her. She stops on the way (due to a traffic jam), and she impatiently moves out of car her to ask the reason. Meanwhile, somebody replaces the medicine bottle with the look-alike bottle of poison from her purse. On arrival in the hospital, she gives the liquid from that bottle to stabilise the patient. This resulted in the patient's death. It is shown that Asha Mathur's husband, Dr. Dinesh Mathur (Parikshat Sahni), had gone to meet Thakral and had asked him to fight his wife's case. Thakral says no claiming he is very busy at the moment but later tells his assistant that there is no way that this case could be won. Arun meets Dinesh Mathur and informs him that he will fight the case. He asked him about the nature of poison and for how long a person can sustain the poison; he learns that poison if might result in death within 2 to 15 minutes depending on the body resistance. The case begins with the prosecution lawyer recounting the events of that fateful day and telling that the medicine given to the patient was actually poison. Arun defends the case says that the patient did not die of this medicine. To prove himself right he drinks the medicine in court and refutes the claim. The court declares Geeta's sister not guilty. Just after the judgement Dr. Mathur rushes Arun to hospital. It is revealed that the medicine contained poison, and Arun is saved in the nick of time. Geeta calls him on a beach to appreciate his efforts and kindness at the canteen. They fall in love. Thakral's son Vikram Thakral (Javed Jaffrey), a spoilt brat, not knowing anything about Arun, passes bad comments at the couple and teases Geeta, which irritates the couple. Soon things take an ugly turn. He beats Vikram and his friends. Dr. Mathur wants to appreciate and compensate Arun for the risky effort he took to save his wife. He calls him for a get-together in his mansion. Dr. Mathur gives Arun a blank cheque. Arun rejects the offers politely and says he did for his self-satisfaction. He then finds the same piano with the sticker of Bhagwat Geeta of Krishna which his father used to play and was auctioned. His memories are refreshed again and with the emotional request he tells Dr. Mathur that this piano is very significant to him and asks for it. Dr. Mathur very happily gives the piano and asks him the reason for accepting this small fees. He tells the Mathur family his tragic story. He says that his mother was never seen after his father's death, and he assumes that she is dead. Vikram plans to trap Arun's sister Komal and learns she studies in the same college. He tries to impress her by his charms, dancing skills, and ways of flattering people. The plan works. Komal falls for him and he convinces her to run away with him (so that he can publicly defame Arun by leaving his sister). At the planned moment, when one of Vikram's ex-girlfriends shows up and tells Komal of Vikram's evil intentions. In the ensuing argument, Vikram murders his girlfriend which is witnessed by the Dr. Mathur's family. The Mathurs arrive at Arun's house to narrate the incident. Mrs. Mathur sees a photo of his mother hanging in the wall. She immediately recognises the face with the patient she is handling for mental disorders. Arun and his sister request them to take to her. In the mental hospital they see their mother. Her memories had stopped on the day of the incident; she feels that their children are eight and five, staying with father. Arun brings her mother to his house and tries to make her come back to normal; she resumes her memory on hearing the song \"Zingadi Har Kadam...\" Arun had been waiting for this moment to take revenge on Thakral. He steps in as the prosecutor against Thakral who is defending his son. The case moves to and fro and, in the end, Arun has the upper hand. Thakral kidnaps Arun's mother and attempts to blackmail him. Arun goes to save his mother and is beaten up by Thakral's goons. Even though injured, Arun fights back. In an attempt to shoot Arun, Thakral shoots his friend's son and is jailed. He is unsuccessful in saving his son, who is given the death penalty. Thakral becomes a mentally unstable person. Arun and his family are happy again and sing the famous \"Zindagi Har Kadam Ek Nayi Jung Hai\" song. Won Nominationed The movie was critically acclaimed, with special praise heaped upon Amrish Puri and Anil Kapoor.

The film stars Sunil Dutt, Nutan, Jamuna (reprising her role from the original Telugu version), Pran and Deven Varma. The award-winning and very popular music was given by Laxmikant Pyarelal. It is among the earliest films to deal with the theme of reincarnation.   Movie starts with the marriage of Radha Devi and Gopinath (Sunil Dutt and Nutan). They start on their honeymoon and has to pass across a river on a ferry boat. While they are in the middle of the river, Gopinath suddenly begins to hallucinate about whirlpool and shouts that they are going to die. Despite of the reassurances from Radha and boatman, Gopinath couldn't be calmed, so Radha orders boatman to take them to nearby shore. Once they reach there, Gopinath starts to say things about Bibiji and a palace that should be there. Radha gets confused and follows him. They meet with an old man who tells them that Bibiji and Gopi are long dead and their palace was now in ruins. Gopinath asks about Gowri, shepherd girl. Old man tells them that she is still alive and would come daily to the graves of Gopi and Radha. While they are talking, an old lady comes there and Gopi recognizes her as Gowri. They go to her and she too recognizes them and tells them that they took rebirth to live together in this life. She starts to narrate their story. Gopi was a poor orphan living with his grandmother in a village on the banks of Ganges. He carries passengers on his boat across the river for living. Radha was a daughter of a zamindar and studies in the city college. Gopi carries her across the river and gives her a rose everyday. Radha finds his innocence lively and maintains a platonic relation with him. He teaches her a song which makes her the winner of singing competition in the college. Gowri (Jamuna), a shepherd girl has feelings for Gopi and always thinks that they are going to marry one day despite of Gopi's disinterest for her. Meanwhile, Rambabu (Deven Varma), Radha's classmate gets attracted to her and starts pursuing. He writes a letter to Radha expressing his love. Radha gets angry for that and sends Gopi to teach him a lesson. But her step mother finds that letter and thinks that Radha is also interested in Rambabu. She sends her brother and Radha's uncle (Pran) to settle this matter. He meets with Rambabu and finds out that he is the heir of a very rich and respectable Roy family and he sincerely wants to marry Radha. He settles their marriage and Radha's parents feel happy about it. Meanwhile, Radha starts to acknowledge her feelings for Gopi and gets shocked to know that her parents settled her marriage with Rambabu. She tries to explain but her father thinks that she was already in love with Rambabu and there is nothing to discuss. She goes to Gopi and tells him about her betrothal and he receives it passively. He indirectly indicates that whatever their feelings for each other are, class difference wouldn't allow any sort of relation between them. Radha accepts her fate and marries Rambabu and leaves her village. As fate has different plans, she comes back to her father's house two months later as a widow. Everybody including her parents, uncle, Gopi and Gowri are shocked and feel bad to see her like that. Her father who was already ill, can't bear to see her in that condition and dies. Radha's uncle tries to molest Gowri but Gopi comes between and saves her. This leads to acrimony between Gopi and him. Gopi continues to meet Radha to console her and to give her courage to live. But Gowri becomes irritated with their relation and fights loudly with Gopi regarding that. This leads to rumors in the village of Radha's affair with Gopi and Radha's mother gets disturbed. Even Radha's in-laws reject to give her share in their property as she was unfaithful to her husband. At last these rumors reach Radha's ears and she goes to Gopi to talk about them. She gets surprised to see how Gopi made his little hut a temple for her. She realizes that he loved her dearly and asks him to elope with her. Gopi hesitates but she tells him that she longer care about the society who has no sympathy for her. They start crossing the river and her uncle follows them with villagers. Gowri, feeling repentant for spreading rumors, offers her body to Radha's uncle asks in return to stop the hunt. He agrees and stops the villagers but whirlpool comes and takes Radha and Gopi in. In present-day Gowri feels happy to see them as a couple and dies in the hands of Gopinath. The lyrics of the film were career-defining for Anand Bakshi and helped take him to the \"top\", with songs like \"Sawan Ka Mahina Pawan Kare Sor\", \"Ram Kare Aisa Ho Jaaye\" and \"Bol Gori Bol\". The music was by Lakshmikant Pyarelal and the playback singers were Lata Mangeshkar and Mukesh.",

        "full_text": " Mirza Ghalib (1954) is an Indian Hindi and Urdu language biographical film, directed by Sohrab Modi. Based on the life of well-known poet Mirza Ghalib, the film was acclaimed upon release. It stars Bharat Bhushan as Ghalib and Suraiya as his courtesan lover. The film won (1) the President's Gold Medal for the All India Best Feature Film and (2) the President's Silver Medal for Best Feature Film in Hindi in the 2nd National Film Awards for 1954. Suraiya's singing (of Mirza Ghalib ghazal's) and her acting was specially applauded by the Prime Minister, Jawahar Lal Nehru, who remarked to her \" You have brought back Ghalib to life\", in a special screening of the film in Rastrapati Bhawan.   The film depicts an episode in the life of famous poet Mirza Ghalib during last Mogul King, Bahadur Shah 'Zafars times. The story revolves around the love and admiration of Moti Begum, (named \"Chaudhvin\"(moon-faced) by Mirza Ghalib), played by Suraiya, for Mirza Ghalib, played by Bharat Bhushan, and its end in the tragic death of 'Chadhvin'(Suraiya). Ghalib is already a married man, married to \"Begum\" (Nigar Sultana), who is a pious woman, in love and awe of her poet husband. Emperor Bahadur Shah \u2018Zafar\u2019 (Iftekhar), himself a poet of considerable stature, is hosting a 'mushaira'(poetry recitation session). At the 'mushaira', the poetry of 'Zauq' is much applauded; Mirza Asadullah Khan \u2018Ghalib\u2019, on the other hand, finds no takers for his 'ghazals' (poems). (In another scene, when ghalib is reciting out of court, even the general populace thinks his ghazals are too profound and his Urdu too difficult.) In the more intellectual environment of the mushaira, nobody except the Mufti (Murad) and the Kotwal, Hashmat Khan (Ulhas) can find anything to appreciate in Ghalib's poetry. The Mufti expresses his appreciation to Ghalib; the Kotwal spends his time hurriedly writing down the ghazal Ghalib has just recited. Ghalib instead of reciting melodiously as others do, starts by just 'reading' his ghazals dryly (maybe he finds the poets below his calibre), and even calls himself a poet ('Sukhender') par excellence in one of his ghazals. This irks some of the poets present, at which Ghalib walks out of the court. On his way home, he hears a woman singing one of his own ghazals. The singer is Moti Begum (Suraiya), daughter of a retired courtesan (Durga Khote). Moti's mad about Ghalib's poetry, and even about the man himself, even though she has no idea what her favourite poet looks like. Ghalib, delighted that someone likes his poetry, knocks on Moti's door and is admitted. Ghalib is awestruck not just by her enthusiasm for his ghazals but also by her beauty, and addresses her as Chaudhvin Begum (chaudhvin means \u2018full moon\u2019). When he realises she doesn\u2019t know that he is Ghalib, he teases her by deprecating Ghalib's poetry. Moti, of course, leaps to her hero's defence and literally shoos the unexpected guest from her house. Right on Ghalib's heels (in fact, bumping into the poet in the doorway) comes another visitor to Moti's house: the Kotwal. He has just returned from the mushaira at the fort, bringing with him the transcript of the Ghalib ghazal he\u2019d heard there. He hands over the ghazal to a grateful Moti, and astonishes her by identifying her recent guest as Ghalib himself. A few days later, Ghalib comes across yet another person singing one of his ghazals. This time, it's a poor mendicant who, when questioned, tells Ghalib that Moti Begum teaches him these ghazals so that he can sing them to earn a few paisas. Ghalib, ego well fuelled, goes off to Moti Begum's house once again, and is welcomed with much ecstatic gushing by the woman, who has now taken to calling herself Chaudhvin Begum. She is shy and demure; he is soulful. But Chaudhvin Begum is just one aspect of Ghalib's somewhat troubled life. He may be a great poet, but that greatness isn\u2019t enough to keep the wolves from the door. One somewhat benevolent wolf is the moneylender Mathuradas (Mukri) to whom Ghalib owes a large sum of money. Mathuradas comes by every now and then, asking for the debt to be cleared; but Ghalib always manages to fob him off. \u2026and there is Ghalib's wife (Nigar Sultana), an extremely religious woman who is tormented by the fact that none of her children have survived beyond infancy. Her relationship with her husband is one of easy camaraderie; she is his staunch supporter, a wife who never cribs that they\u2019re forever in debt and who, even when she suspects that her husband is in love with another woman, does not protest or demand his love for herself. (Instead, she tells him to marry a second time). This is an intriguing woman; she can be surprisingly progressive at times, irritatingly duh at others, and even, occasionally, appealing and wise. Right now, however, the one facing hard times is Chaudhvin Begum. The Kotwal, Hashmat Khan, has been lusting after her and has persuaded Chaudhvin's penurious mother to give her daughter in marriage to him. He has even paid a bride price of Rs 2,000\u2014and Chaudhvin's mother, despite all of Chaudhvin's protests, insists that the wedding will take place. In desperation, Chaudhvin writes a letter to Ghalib and sends it to him through her doorkeeper-cum-general dogsbody, a man with a taste for liquor. The man sets out for Ghalib's house on a Tuesday, wanders into a wine shop, and emerges on Thursday, leaving Ghalib very little time to devise any very effective plan to rescue Chaudhvin from this unwanted marriage. He decides to hand over Rs 2,000 to Chaudhvin's mother; but since he doesn\u2019t possess that much, he sets out to \u2018earn\u2019 it\u2014by gambling. He's successful, and hurries off to hand over the sum to the money-grubbing old woman. \u2026Who has, in the meantime, become a changed person, all because a desperate Chaudhvin has tried to commit suicide. Suddenly overcome by a fit of maternal affection, Chaudhvin's mother heaps recriminations on the head of the just-arrived Kotwal: he will not be married to Chaudhvin, not for all the gold in the world. Much arguing ensues, but the mother stands firm and the Kotwal is left fuming and vowing vengeance\u2014mainly on Ghalib. There is much to come, of course: the Kotwal's attempts to have his revenge on Ghalib; Ghalib's own growing love for Chaudhvin Begum, and his wife's increasing frustration\u2014on the one hand, jealous of Chaudhvin Begum; on the other, wishing for her husband's happiness. And all of it played out against the background of a Delhi that's changing, even the de jure power of its puppet emperor now ceded to the British Resident.",

Sanjay Dutt, Hrithik Roshan, Preity Zinta, Sonali Kulkarni, Jackie Shroff and Mohsin Memon appeared in the main roles. The film follows the life and tragedy of a young boy named Altaaf after his entire family is accidentally killed by police officers. He is adopted by the police chief who is responsible for this, and when Altaaf finds out, he seeks revenge and becomes a terrorist. The film also deals with terrorism and the tragedy of children suffering from war. Its screenplay was written by Pulitzer Prize finalist Suketu Mehta. It was rated R in America due to violence. The film was screened at the Stockholm International Film Festival. Upon release, Mission Kashmir became a critical and commercial success. Despite releasing on the same date as Mohabbatein it took a record opening and went on to become the third biggest domestic grosser of that year.   Mission Kashmir received generally positive reviews from critics. Mohammad Ali Ikram of Planet Bollywood gave it an 8.5/10 rating, praising the film's technical quality and the lead actors' performances. Saisuresh Sivaswamy of Rediff.com wrote, \"This is a story from the director's heart, not his head, and the sincerity comes across in frame after frame.\" Giving the film 4 out of 5 stars, N K Deoshi of apunkachoice.com wrote, \"Beneath all the drama that goes on in the movie there lurks the aspiration to get across to people the message of what actually people of Kashmir are going through.\" Savitha Padmanabhan of The Hindu stated, \"\"Mission Kashmir\" might have its faults but it is definitely a cut above the rest of the commercial Hindi films that have been made on terrorism.\" She also praised the cast's performance and the film's production values. Film journal Screen praised the performances, but further wrote, \"Chopra makes a sincere effort in his latest film Mission Kashmir to bring to the fore, the turmoil in the valley. But one feels disappointed, all the same, that there is very little of Kashmiriyat in the story, which is more of a personal conflict between the victim of a police shoot-out and a police officer.\" The soundtrack of the film contains seven songs. The music is conducted by the award-winning trio Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, performing separately. Ehsaan Noorani composed three songs, while Shankar Mahadevan and Loy Mendonsa composed two songs each.",

        "full_text": " Mohabbatein (English: Love Stories) is a 2000 Indian musical romantic drama film directed by Aditya Chopra. It was Chopra's second directorial venture after Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and was filmed at India and the United Kingdom. The film stars Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan in pivotal roles, along with six young debutantes. Aishwarya Rai appeared in flashbacks as Khan's lover. The film's soundtrack was composed by Jatin-Lalit, while the lyrics were penned by Anand Bakshi. The film is notable for being the first time that Bachchan and Khan appeared on-screen together. The film went on to do well both critically and commercially. It was the second highest Bollywood grosser of 2000, after Rakesh Roshan's Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai. It also won several awards including the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor and the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor, for Khan and Bachchan respectively.   Narayan Shankar (Amitabh Bachchan) is the strict headmaster of Gurukul, a prestigious all-boys university. Narayan wants the best out of his students, and places emphasis on tradition, honor and discipline. He has run the university for 25 years and over that time, he has forbid the students from any kind of romance \u2014 anyone he catches falling in love will be expelled. The film focuses on three of the school's students: Sameer (Jugal Hansraj), Vicky (Uday Chopra) and Karan (Jimmy Shergill) who all fall in love. Sameer is in love with Sanjana (Kim Sharma), his childhood friend. Vicky falls for Ishika (Shamita Shetty), a student at the all-girls university next door to Gurukul. Karan becomes smitten with Kiran (Preeti Jhangiani), a girl he sees one night at a train station. All three know that if they're caught they'd be expelled, so they at first do not pursue their love interests. Raj Aryan (Shah Rukh Khan) joins Gurukul as a music teacher. He challenges the status quo and slowly introduces changes that Narayan dislikes. Raj is a strong believer of love, and when he learns the stories of the three boys, he encourages them to follow their hearts. The boys take his advice, but are disappointed: Sameer discovers that Sanjana has a boyfriend; Vicky only makes Ishika dislike him when trying to woo her; Karan learns that Kiran is married to a pilot who is assumed to be dead. Raj tells the boys to not be disheartened, and tells them that his love, Megha (Aishwarya Rai) is dead, but he continues to love her and imagines that she is still by his side. Raj encourages the boys to continue to stay loyal to their loves. One day Raj throws a party in Gurukul, inviting the students from the girls' school from next door as part of his plan to spread love in Gurukul. Narayan is furious and threatens to fire him. Raj then reveals he was a student at Gurukul years ago, and he fell in love with Megha, who was Narayan's only daughter. Narayan had expelled Raj without ever seeing his face, and afterward Megha committed suicide. Raj returned to Gurukul as a teacher in the hopes of changing Narayan's ways and honoring his love for Megha. Raj promises that before he leaves Gurukul, he will fill it with so much love that even Narayan will not be able to remove it. Narayan accepts this challenge, and allows Raj to continue as a teacher for a while longer. Sameer, Vicky, and Karan one by one win over the girls they love. Narayan retaliates by tightening the rules of Gurukul, but the boys continue to break the rules, which encourages other students to do the same. Narayan finally decides to expel the three, and Raj speaks up on their behalf, telling Narayan that he is the instigator and the boys should not be punished for it. Raj also says that he feels Narayan lost the battle, because his daughter left him and now Raj (who considered Narayan an elder) is leaving him. Raj's words make Narayan realise his mistake. He publicly apologises to the students and steps down as the principal, allowing Raj to take over. Raj turns Gurukul into a love-filled university. In the end Raj, Narayan and a vision of Megha walk happily together towards the gates of Gurukul. Before the production of the film, Amitabh Bachchan was attempting a revival of his career but it was of little success. Also, he was in financial trouble with the bankruptcy of his production company, ABCL, which was hurting his image. These troubles left him almost penniless, and it was at this time that he contacted his friend and director/producer Yash Chopra, who told him of an upcoming production that he could be in. With Mohabbatein, he was finally able to shed his \"hero\" image and to play older, more mature roles. This was the first film in which Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan appeared together. This created a strong buzz for the film as it brought two huge stars of different generations together. Filming took place in India and England. Longleat, a country house in Wiltshire, England, was used as the location for filming Gurukul school. Oxford and Cambridge Universities were also used for filming. The scene where Narayan Shankar walks right before meeting Raj Aryan was filmed at the Queen's College, Oxford. The railway station scenes were shot at Apta Railway Station, Panvel Maharashtra, India. The scene where Karan asks for friendship from Kiran was shot at Birla Mandir, Revdanda, Alibag, Maharashtra, India. It was rumored that Sridevi was approached to be a love interest to Narayan Shankar, but she turned down the role. Midway through the filming of the song \"Aankhein Khuli\", Jugal Hansraj fractured his foot, which required him to wear a cast for the rest of the filming of the song. Aishwarya Rai was slated to only make a guest appearance, but her presence generated so much interest that her role was promoted to that of a regular character. The music of Mohabbatein was composed by Jatin Lalit while lyrics were penned by Anand Bakshi. The album was very well received by the audience. It was the best selling Bollywood soundtrack of the 2000s. Music was used extensively throughout the film and features leitmotifs that relate to each of the main characters (each couple having unique theme music). The songs included on the official soundtrack: Mohabbatein grossed \u20b970.62 crore (US$11\u00a0million) in India and $4.17 million (\u20b919.39 crore) in other countries, for a worldwide total of \u20b990.01 crore (US$14\u00a0million), against its \u20b919 crore (US$2.9\u00a0million) budget.

It is the highest-grossing film of 2000 worldwide. It opened on Friday, October 27, 2000, across 315 screens, and earned \u20b91.19 crore (US$180,000) nett on its opening day.

The film was released on 1 July 1994 and went on to become the second highest grossing Indian film of 1994. The film got nine Filmfare nominations in 1995. It was the first time where the trio of Akshay Kumar, Sunil Shetty and Paresh Rawal worked together. Originally Divya Bharti was considered for the female lead and she also completed shooting for many scenes of the film, but after her death, Raveena Tandon was roped into the project as her replacement. The film is also remembered for its songs which became chartbusters in that year. The popularity of the song \"Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast\", which was picturised on Raveena Tandon led to her being nicknamed \"The mast mast girl\".   Vishal Agnihotri (Sunil Shetty), a convict, is imprisoned for the murder of a group of four criminals who had brutally raped and killed his sister-in-law. Vishal tries to get justice in court but is unsuccessful and the men are let out free with the help of a corrupt lawyer. They then visit Vishal's home for trying to file a case on them, and try to rape Vishal's wife Priya (Poonam Jhawer), but she kills herself with a knife. Angered at all this Vishal decides to take the matter into his own hands and murders the four criminals himself. He is sentenced for life in prison for the crimes. Journalist Roma Singh (Raveena Tandon) visits the jail for a report she's writing, where a few of the convicts try to rape her. It reminds Vishal of his misfortune. Vishal intervenes and saves Roma. Roma hears Vishal's story and decides to help free him. Her voice is heard out by a blind businessman - Mr Jindal (Naseeruddin Shah) who tries to recruit Vishal as a hitman. He wants Vishal to kill some anti-social elements in the city, mainly the two powerful drug lords Jibran (Raza Murad) and Tyson (Gulshan Grover) and all the people who work for them. He tells Vishal, that these people are responsible for creating people like the group of four men he killed in the first place, by bringing drugs to the streets and corrupting the locals. Vishal refuses at first as he has just got out of prison, and now wants to live a normal life. However, the memories of his murdered family comes back to haunt him as he spends a day alone in his home, and he agrees to work for Jindal. Inspector Sahoo (Paresh Rawal) is very greedy and he becomes informer of Jibraan. He tells all internal matters of police department in return of money. Police Inspector Amar Saxena (Akshay Kumar) is unhappy about the release of Vishal who he believes deserves to be in prison because of the murders he committed. Things complicate even more when Amar finds Vishal around almost every murder scene of criminals involved in drug-trading, who Amar is trying to catch alive. Vishal goes on a murder spree, until he realizes that even the Commissioner (Sadashiv Amrapurkar) thinks that the unknown murderer is doing more help to the society than police could ever do. Vishal refuses to kill the Commissioner, but Jindal becomes angry. Vishal attacks Jindal with a paper-weight, but Jindal dodges it. Vishal then realizes that Jindal is not blind. Jindal tells Vishal that Jibran and Tyson were his rivals. He also tells that he murdered his wife Pooja (Priya Tendulkar) & Inspector Karan Saxena (who happens to be Amar's father), to cover up the truth. He pretended to be blind to throw the police off his trail. Jindal, who has now partnered with Jibran, leaves Vishal to die. Vishal escaped, only to be confronted by Amar. Vishal subdues Amar & tells him the truth. Inspector Sahoo, who is brought to Jindal by Jibran to give important information about Vishal, tells him that Vishal is alive and will tell the entire truth to Amar and Commissioner by next morning. Then Jindal kidnaps Roma and kills his sub-editor Siddiqui who tries to save Roma. Amar, Vishal and Commissioner goes to Jindal's home to arrest him but they find the Sub-editor Siddiqui brutally murdered at his home. They come to know that Jindal has kidnapped Roma in order to forcefully marry her. Amar & Vishal find out Jindal's den with the help of Inspector Sahoo & corner him. After a melee, Jibran is killed. Jindal tries to kill Amar, but Vishal takes the bullet on himself. Vishal dies in Amar's lap, upon which Amar kills Jindal and avenges the death of Vishal & his father. The music of the film was composed by Viju Shah, with lyrics by Anand Bakshi. Mohra was one of the most successful soundtrack albums of the year, especially the song \"Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast\". Initially, Viju Shah wanted Sapna Mukherjee to render \"Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast\" but, on Rajiv Rai's insistence, opted for Kavita Krishnamurthy instead. The track is based on the popular qawwali \"Dam Mast Qalandar\" by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. The album went to become second most sold of the year.",

        "full_text": " Mother India is a 1957 Indian Hindi-language epic drama film, directed by Mehboob Khan and starring Nargis, Sunil Dutt, Rajendra Kumar, and Raaj Kumar. A remake of Khan's earlier film Aurat (1940), it is the story of a poverty-stricken village woman named Radha (Nargis) who, in the absence of her husband, struggles to raise her sons and survive against a cunning money-lender amidst many troubles. Despite her hardship, she sets a goddess-like moral example of an ideal Indian woman. The title of the film was chosen to counter American author Katherine Mayo's 1927 polemical book Mother India, which vilified Indian culture. Allusions to Hindu mythology are abundant in the film, and its lead character has been seen as a metonymic representation of a Hindu woman who reflects high moral values and the concept of what it means to be a mother to society through self-sacrifice. Mother India metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of independence, and alludes to a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building. While some authors treat Radha as the symbol of women empowerment, others see her cast in female stereotypes. The Oedipal elements between Radha and her son Birju have also been discussed by authors. The film was shot in Mumbai's Mehboob Studios and in the villages of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh states. The music by Naushad introduced Western classical music and Hollywood-style orchestra to Hindi cinema. The film was the most expensive Hindi cinema (Bollywood) production and earned the highest revenue for any Hindi film at that time. Adjusted for inflation, Mother India still ranks among the all-time Indian box office hits. It was released in India amid fanfare in October or November 1957, and had several high-profile screenings, including one at the capital New Delhi attended by the country's president and prime minister. Mother India became a definitive cultural classic and is regarded as one of the best films in Indian and world cinema. It was India's first submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1958, where it got the nomination and lost the award by just one vote. The film won the All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film, the Filmfare Best Film Award for 1957, and Nargis and Khan won the Best Actress and Best Director awards respectively.   The film is set in 1957, the present day at the time of shooting. When construction of an irrigation canal to the village is completed, Radha (Nargis), considered to be the \"mother\" of the village, is asked to inaugurate the canal. She remembers her past, when she was newly married. The wedding between Radha and Shamu (Raaj Kumar) is paid for by Radha's mother-in-law, who borrows the money from the moneylender Sukhilala. The conditions of the loan are disputed, but the village elders decide in favour of the moneylender, after which Shamu and Radha are forced to pay three quarters of their crop as interest on the loan of \u20b9500 (valued at about US$105 in 1957).[a][b] While Shamu works to bring more of their rocky land into use, his arms are crushed by a boulder. Ashamed of his helplessness (being without arms) and humiliated by Sukhilala for living on the earnings of his wife, Shamu decides that he is of no use to his family and permanently leaves Radha and their three sons, walking to his own probable death by starvation. Soon after, Radha's youngest son and her mother-in-law die. A severe storm and the resulting flood destroys houses in the village and ruins the harvest. Sukhilala offers to save Radha and her sons if she trades her body to him for food. Radha vehemently refused his offer, but had to also lose her infant (her fourth son) to the atrocities of the storm. Although the villagers begin initially to evacuate the village, they decide to stay and rebuild it, persuaded by Radha. Several years later, Radha's two surviving children, Birju (Sunil Dutt) and Ramu (Rajendra Kumar), are young men. Birju, embittered since childhood by the demands of Sukhilala, takes out his frustrations by pestering the village girls, especially Sukhilala's daughter, Rupa. Ramu, by contrast, has a calmer temperament and is married soon after. Birju's anger finally becomes dangerous and, after being provoked, he attacks Sukhilala and his daughter and steals Radha's kangan (marriage bracelets) that were pawned with Sukhilala. He is chased out of the village and becomes a bandit. Radha promises Sukhilala that she will not let Birju cause harm to Sukhilala's family. On Rupa's wedding day, Birju returns with his gang of bandits to exact his revenge. He kills Sukhilala and kidnaps Rupa. When he tries to flee the village on his horse, Radha, his mother, shoots him. He dies in her arms. The film returns to 1957; Radha opens the gate of the canal and its reddish water flows into the fields. The title Mother India was inspired by American author Katherine Mayo's 1927 polemical book of the same name, in which she attacked Indian society, religion and culture. Written against the Indian demands for self-rule and independence from British rule, the book pointed to the treatment of India's women, the untouchables, animals, dirt, and the character of its nationalistic politicians. Mayo singled out the rampant and fatally weakening sexuality of its males to be at the core of all problems, leading to masturbation, rape, homosexuality, prostitution, venereal diseases, and, most importantly, premature sexual intercourse and maternity. The book created an outrage across India, and it was burned along with her effigy. It was criticised by Mahatma Gandhi as a \"report of a drain inspector sent out with the one purpose of opening and examining the drains of the country to be reported upon\". The book prompted over fifty angry books and pamphlets to be published to highlight Mayo's errors and false perception of Indian society, which had become a powerful influence on the American people's view of India. Mehboob Khan had the idea for the film and the title as early as 1952, five years after India's independence; in October that year, he approached the import authorities of the Indian government to seek permission for importing raw stocks for the film.[c] In 1955, the ministries of External Affairs and Information-and-Broadcasting learned of the title of the forthcoming film and demanded that the director send them the script for review, suspicious that it was based on the book and thus a possible threat to national interest. The film team dispatched the script along with a two-page letter on 17 September 1955 saying: There has been considerable confusion and misunderstanding in regard to our film production Mother India and Mayo's book. Not only are the two incompatible but totally different and indeed opposite. We have intentionally called our film Mother India, as a challenge to this book, in an attempt to evict from the minds of the people the scurrilous work that is Miss Mayo's book. Khan was inspired by American author Pearl S. Buck and her books The Good Earth (1931) and The Mother (1934); he also saw the film The Good Earth (1937), directed by Sidney Franklin. The Mother chronicled the life of a Chinese woman, including her married life and lonely struggle after being abandoned by her husband. Aspects of Mother India, such as moneylenders, toiling on land, and rearing children through hardship were part of the story. Khan originally drew upon these influences in making his 1940 film Aurat, the original version of Mother India. Khan bought the rights of Aurat from the production company National Studios for \u20b935,000 (valued at about US$7,350 in 1957).[a] Stylistic elements of Mother India show similarities with Vsevolod Pudovkin's Soviet silent film Mother (1926); Our Daily Bread (1934), directed by King Vidor; and films of Alexander Dovzhenko. Certain imagery in the film, such as \"happy farmers, sickles in their hand, smiling from behind ripening crops\", resemble posters by Soviet constructivist artists. The script of Aurat was devised by Wajahat Mirza, based upon a story by Babubhai Mehta. For Mother India, it was reworked by Mirza and the young screenwriter S. Ali Raza. Apart from Mehboob Khan, Mirza and Raza, prominent screenwriters Aghajani Kashmeri, Zia Sarhadi, Akhtar Mirza, music director Naushad, assistant director Chimankant Desai and many others were consulted. The dialogue, reworked by Mirza and Raza, mixed vernacular Hindi with its literary counterpart. The script was intentionally written in a way that promoted the empowerment of women in Indian society (including the power to resist sexual advances) and the maintenance of a sense of moral dignity and purpose as individuals; this was contrary to what Mayo had claimed in her book. These themes, present in Aurat, were further developed with a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building, utilising characters personifying abstract qualities such as \"beauty and goodness, wealth and power, poverty and exploitation, community spirit\". Nargis was the director's first choice for the role of Radha, and despite only being aged 26 at the time, she played the role of the new wife, young single mother and an aged mother of two sons. Nargis\u2014the reigning queen of Hindi cinema at the time\u2014had started her career in a leading role with Khan's Taqdeer (1943) and acted under his direction in Humayun (1945) and Andaz (1949) too. Mother India is generally regarded as Nargis's best performance and was her last major film, before retirement after marriage. Khan had wanted to cast Sabu Dastagir, a Hollywood star of Indian origin, as Birju. Dastagir travelled to India from Los Angeles, stayed in a hotel in Mumbai (then known as Bombay) and received a retainer. However, delays and obstacles in beginning shooting and getting a work permit for Dastagir led to his dismissal from the project. Dilip Kumar, an established actor in the Hindi film industry, had originally expressed an interest in playing Birju, which Khan found agreeable; Dilip Kumar agreed to play Shamu as well. However, Nargis objected that the public would not accept their casting as mother and son because she had done several romantic films alongside him. Sunil Dutt\u2014with the experience of just one film\u2014was finally cast, after Mukri, a comedian in the film, introduced him to Khan. Sajid Khan, the actor who portrayed the young Birju, was unknown at the time, and was from a poor family from the Mumbai slums. Sajid's salary in the film was \u20b9750. He was later adopted by Mehboob Khan. Subsequently, Raaj Kumar was cast as Shamu and Rajendra Kumar as Ramu. Mother India was the first successful film and a turning point in the careers of Dutt, Raaj Kumar and Rajendra Kumar. Before principal photography began, Nargis and Raaj Kumar familiarised themselves with farming practices such as ploughing the fields, reaping and sowing, and cotton picking. The extras in the song and dance sequences of the film were from local dance groups in villages where the shooting took place instead of the usual ones from Mumbai. The initial filming for Mother India began unexpectedly, even before the script and cast were finalised. In 1955, parts of Uttar Pradesh suffered from major flooding. Cinematographer Faredoon Irani travelled to flood-afflicted districts to shoot generic flood scenes. The scheduled principal photography started in 1955 with a budget of \u20b920\u201325 lakh (approximately US$420,000\u2013525,000 in 1957[a]). However, the budget increased to \u20b935\u201340 lakh (approximately US$735,000\u2013840,000 in 1957[a]) by the end of the filming because of the outdoor sessions and cast and crew's salaries. This budget, a record at the time, was surpassed by Mughal-e-Azam in 1960. Several indoor scenes for the film were shot in 1956 at Mehboob Studios in Bandra, Mumbai. Khan and Irani attempted to shoot frequently on location to make the film as realistic as possible. Locations included various villages in Maharashtra, Gujarat (Maharashtra and Gujarat together formed Bombay State then) and Uttar Pradesh. The film was shot in 35mm. Contemporary cinematographer Anil Mehta has noted the mastery of Irani's cinematic techniques in shooting the film, including his \"intricate tracks and pans, the detailed mise en sc\u00e8ne patterns Irani conceived, even for brief shots\u2014in the studios as well as on location\". The film took about three years to make, from early organisation, planning, and scripting to completion of filming. In a November 1956 interview, Nargis described the film shoot and her role as the most demanding of her career. Mother India was shot in Gevacolor, later converted to Technicolor. It was shot mostly using the sync sound technique, which was common at the time; some scenes were dubbed. For shooting the flood scene, a farmer agreed to flood 500 acres (200\u00a0ha) of his land. In the exodus scene following the flood, 300\u00a0bullock carts, 200\u00a0farmers and many horses, tractors and ploughs were used. Gayatri Chatterjee writes about the popular belief that all these were made available by villagers without reimbursement, in her book. However, account ledgers of the production revealed that the villagers were paid. There was a protracted scene in the film in which Radha runs between burning haystacks in search for her son Birju, a renegade bandit, who was hiding there. The fire scene was shot in Umra area of Surat,Gujarat, by burning bales of hay. Nargis and Dutt acted in the fire scene without doubles. On 1 March 1957, an accident occurred during the fire scene when the wind direction changed and the fire grew out of control, trapping Nargis. She was saved by Dutt, who quickly grabbed a blanket, plunged inside, and rescued her. Shooting halted temporarily as both had sustained injuries. Dutt was hospitalised for the burns and Nargis helped nurse him, at Khan's place in Billimora. Nargis\u2014a popular actress at the time\u2014fell in love with Dutt, who was in early stages of his film career and played her son in the film; they married on 11 March 1958. Nargis wished to marry soon after the film, but Khan protested that real-life marriage of the onscreen mother-son would be disastrous for the film. Owing to their relationship, Nargis also found it difficult to perform a scene where she beat Dutt with a lathi. Various authors identify the character of Radha with Hindu mythological goddesses and characters, such as Radha (the lover of the god Krishna, personifying love and romance), Sita (the divine heroine of the Hindu epic Ramayana, personifying high moral value), Savitri (representing great morality and loyalty to husband), Draupadi (personifying duty and morality), Dharti-mata (earth-mother goddess) and Lakshmi (Hindu goddess of prosperity). Besides these gentle goddesses, the character of Radha has shades of more ferocious warrior goddesses like Durga and Kali. Film scholars have compared the mild-mannered, obedient son Ramu with the god Rama of the epic Ramayana, and the romantic outlaw Birju\u2014a name of Krishna\u2014with the god Krishna, known for his transgressions. Shamu (another name of Krishna), Radha's husband who leaves her, is also equated with Krishna, who left his lover Radha in mythological accounts. The title Mother India and Radha's character are described to be allusions not only to the Hindu Mother Goddess, but also to Bharat Mata (literally \"Mother India\"), the national personification of India, generally represented as a Hindu goddess.[d] According to professor Nalini Natarajan of the University of Puerto Rico, Nargis's Mother India is a metonymic representation of a Hindu woman, reflecting high Hindu values, with virtuous morality and motherly self-sacrifice. Film scholar Jyotika Virdi wrote that Mother India could also be seen as a metaphor of the trinity of mother, God, and a dynamic nation. Vijay Mishra, in his 2002 book Bollywood Cinema: Temples of Desire, opined that the Mother India figure is an icon in several respects\u2014being associated with a goddess, her function as a wife, as a lover, and even compromising her femininity at the end of the film by playing the role of Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer, masculine gods. According to Indian film scholars Gokulsing and Dissanayake, while aspiring to traditional Hindu values, the character of Mother India also represents the changing role of the mother in Indian cinema and society in that the mother is not always subservient or dependent on her husband, refining the relationship to the male gender or patriarchal social structures. The New Internationalist said in an 1999 review that Radha transforms from a submissive wife to an independent mother, thereby breaking female stereotypes in Hindi film. In contrast, in a 2012 article in the newspaper The Hindu, author Tarini Sridharan has pointed out tropes such as upholding female chastity, wifely devotion and saintly motherhood that reinforce gender stereotypes. While the action of sacrificing motherhood to uphold a woman's dignity is termed as feminist by some, other authors see it as an attempt of a community woman to protect the patriarchal village structure, that esteems izzat (honour) of women. A promotional pamphlet to introduce the social context of the film to western audiences described Indian women as being \"an altar in India\", and that Indians \"measure the virtue of their race by the chastity of their women\", and that \"Indian mothers are the nucleus around which revolves the tradition and culture of ages.\" In a 2002 review in The New York Times, film critic Dave Kehr compares the film with Stella Dallas (1937) for the thematic similarity of series of sacrifices made by the female lead, and with Gone with the Wind (1939) as an epic mirroring social upheavals. Film critic Mark Cousins and author Tejaswini Ganti agree that the film is the Gone with the Wind of Indian cinema. The term \"Mother India\" has been defined as \"a common icon for the emergent Indian nation in the early 20th\u00a0century in both colonialist and nationalist discourse\". Many authors, including Gayatri Chatterjee, author of Mother India (2002), interpret the film as an allegory signifying patriotism and the changing situation in the newly independent nation, and how India was functioning without British authority. It echoes the tale of a modern India, liberating itself from \"feudal and colonial oppression\". The film, an archetypal nationalistic picture, is symbolic in that it demonstrated the euphoria of \"Mother India\" in a nation that had only been independent for 10\u00a0years, and it had a long-lasting cultural impact upon the Indian people. Film scholar Saibal Chatterjee considers Mother India a \"mirror of independent India\", highlighting problems of a nascent nation, including rural exploitation of farmers by money-lenders, in a dramatic fashion understandable to the common viewer. It also represents the agrarian poverty and hardship of the people at the time. The red water that flows from the canal irrigating the green fields at the end of the film is seen by Chatterjee as a metaphor to represent the blood of Indians in the struggle for independence, flowing to nourish a new free India. The canal is described by Virdi to signal the imminent end of the feudal order. However, despite Radha's struggle against feudal oppression depicted in the film, her action of stopping the rebellious Birju and upholding status quo\u2014the feudal and patriarchal order\u2014is seen as \"regressive\" by various authors. In a study of media and popular culture in South Asia, author Mahasveta Barua draws parallel between the film's metaphorical representation of the mother as nation, and the metonymic identification with India that Indira Gandhi, India's only woman prime minister, sought and tried for during her tenure (1966\u201377, and 1980\u201384). In his book Terrorism, Media, Liberation, John David Slocum argues that like Satyajit Ray's classic masterpiece Pather Panchali (1955), Khan's Mother India has \"vied for alternative definitions of Indianness\". However, he emphasises that the film is an overt mythologising and feminising of the nation in which Indian audiences have used their imagination to define it in the nationalistic context, given that in reality the storyline is about a poverty-stricken peasant from northern India, rather than a true ideal of a modernising, powerful nation. The Radha\u2013Birju relationship is described to have \"Oedipal elements\" by many authors; Virdi has argued that in her chastity, Radha channels her sexual desires into maternal love for her sons who effectively become \"substitute erotic subjects\". Mishra opines that the crushing of arms of Radha's husband and the mellowness of the older son symbolise castration, which is in contrast with the rebellion of Birju, identified with sexual potency. Birju's obsession with his mother's bracelets is an expression of his oedipal longings, according to Chakravarty. Rachel Dwyer, Professor of Indian Cultures and Cinema at SOAS, describes how \"suspiciously smoothly\" the Oedipal elements fits into the film and the off-screen romance between Nargis and Dutt, playing mother and son in the film. Radha's actions at the end of the film in shooting her own son was a breaking of traditional mother\u2013son relationship to safeguard morality, according to author William van der Heide. Virdi points out that this brought ambiguity to the mother figure who acts as a sacrificing provider and also as a destroyer, annihilating her own son, something rare in Hindi cinema. She interprets Birju's sexual advances on a village girl (which is incest in north Indian village culture[e]) as being a substitute in the plot for the incestuous mother\u2013son relationship and his death at the end as a punishment for violation of the taboo. Authors such as Eshun and Woods state that Radha and Ramu are the archetypal champions of virtue in battling hardship and injustice, while Birju is a mischievous child who becomes the anarchist whose uncontrollable rebellion destroys order. Mishra has noted that although Radha upholds Dharma (the natural law or order) in the film, it is Birju who achieves identification from the spectators; in his rebellion lies the agenda of political action that will usher social change. Mishra notes that due to such conflicting ideas, the film is very much conforming, and yet \"defiantly subversive\". Film scholar Vijay Mishra has pointed out the presence of \"highly syncretic hyphenated Hindu\u2013Muslim nature\" of Bollywood in the film. Parama Roy has interpreted that Nargis's legendary status as the titular Mother India is due to Hinduisation of the role and her real-life marriage with a Hindu; she is, according to Roy, scripted as a renouncer of Muslim separatism in the film. Mishra has found metacritical value in Salman Rushdie's commentary on the film in his novel The Moor's Last Sigh (1995) in which Rushdie describes: In Mother India, a piece of Hindu myth-making directed by a Muslim socialist, Mehboob Khan, the Indian peasant women is idealised as bride, mother, and producers of sons, as long-suffering, stoical, loving, redemptive, and conservatively wedded to the maintenance of the social status quo. But for Bad Birju, cast out from his mother's love, she becomes, as one critic mentioned, 'that image of an aggressive, treacherous, annihilating mother who haunts the fantasy of Indian males'. The production team had planned to release Mother India to commemorate the tenth anniversary of India's independence on 15 August 1957, but the film was released over two months later.[f] It premiered at the Liberty Cinema in Mumbai on 25 October 1957, during Diwali; it ran continuously at Liberty for over a year. It was released in Kolkata (then called Calcutta) the same day and in Delhi a week later. It had reached all regions in India by the end of November. Government ministers and other officials were invited to the premieres, and a special screening was held in Rashtrapati Bhavan (the presidential quarter) in New Delhi on 23 October 1957; the event was attended by President Rajendra Prasad, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter Indira Gandhi. Chief Minister of West Bengal Bidhan Chandra Roy and Governor Padmaja Naidu attended a screening in Kolkata. Impressed with the film's nationalistic message, Chief Minister of Bombay State Morarji Desai granted it exemption from entertainment tax in the state. No reliable data is available on the box office earnings of Mother India. It was in continuous distribution in theatres in India until the mid-1990s. There was a renewed interest in the film in the 1970s causing an upsurge in ticket sales. Film trade websites provide estimates of its business. Boxofficeindia.com gives \u20b940 million (US$620,000) as its gross, and \u20b91,173 million (US$18\u00a0million) as its adjusted net gross, as of 2012. According to Chatterjee, it did exceptionally good business in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka (then called Mysore State) and Maharashtra. The film's success led Khan to name his next film Son of India. Released in 1962, it was not well received. Mother India was dubbed in several European languages including Spanish, French and Russian; it did substantial business in Greece, Spain and Russia and was released in the Eastern Bloc countries. Technicolor arranged one screening of the film in Paris on 30 June 1958, under the name Les bracelets d'or (\"The Gold Bracelets\"). It did minimal business in Paris, but fared better in French colonies. It was successful in the Latin American countries of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Mother India was also acclaimed across the Arab world, in the Middle East, parts of Southeast Asia, and North Africa and continued to be shown in countries such as Algeria at least ten years after its release. It was released in US on 9 July 1959 to lukewarm response, and the UK release in 1961 was also a commercial failure. The initial international version with English subtitles was 40 minutes shorter than the Indian release. As of 2013, Mother India is available in DVD in all regions NTSC format, distributed by the Eros Entertainment. Baburao Patel of the film magazine Filmindia (December 1957) described Mother India after its release as \"the greatest picture produced in India\" and wrote that no other actress would have been able to perform the role as well as Nargis. A review in Monthly Film Bulletin in 1958 remarked that audiences in UK should be grateful that the international version was shortened by 40 minutes, and termed it a \"rag-bag pantomime\". After its US release in 1959, Irene Thirer reviewed the film in the New York Post in which she praised its \"striking dramatic appeal\", but feared it might not be accepted by American audiences due to cultural differences. In a 1976 article in the journal Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, author Michael Gallagher found the film \"an amazing mixture of political allegory and cheap musical, a cross between the impressiveness of Eisenstein and the banality of Show Boat\". The New Internationalist in 1999 found Nargis's acting \"exemplary\", and noted \"a clever interplay\u2014artistically and politically\u2014between the traditional and the radical\" evident in Mother India. In a 2002 article in The Village Voice, film critic J. Hoberman described the film as \"an outrageous masala of apparently discordant elements.\" He characterised it as a mixture of \"indigenous versions of Soviet-style tractor-opera, Italian neo-realism, Hollywood kiddie-cuteness, a dozen Technicolor musical numbers, and, most significantly, a metaphoric overlay of pop Hinduism.\" Hoberman criticised the acting as \"broad\", and also wrote about the \"vaguely left-wing\" nationalist overtone of the film. Author Phill Hall, writing for Film Threat in 2002, described the film as exceptionally sluggish and one-dimensional, and lampooned it saying \"it takes the strongest of constitutions to endure this film without entertaining notions of matricide.\" Jonathan Romney in his 2002 report in The Independent observed the earth-mother Radha as \"India's answer to Anna Magnani\" and the film as \"an all-out exercise in ideological myth-making.\" Women's Feature Service, in a 2007 article, noted Mother India as \"one of the most outstanding films of the post-Independence era.\" Ziya Us Salam of The Hindu wrote in her 2010 report, \"Mehboob was able to blend the individual with the universal, thereby enhancing the film's appeal without compromising on its sensitivity.\" Mother India, its star Nargis, and the director Khan received many awards and nominations. Nargis won the Filmfare Best Actress Award in 1958 and became the first Indian to receive the Best Actress award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in present-day Czech Republic. Mother India won the Filmfare Award for Best Film and scooped several other Filmfare awards including Best Director for Khan, Best Cinematographer for Faredoon Irani, and Best Sound for R. Kaushik. In 1958, the film became India's first submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and was chosen as one of the five nominations for the category.[g] The international version, 120 minutes long, was sent for Oscars. Additionally, this version had English subtitles, and dropped Mehboob Productions' logo, which featured the Communist hammer and sickle, to appease the Academy. The 120-minute version was later distributed in the US and UK by Columbia Pictures. The film came close to winning the Academy Award but lost to Federico Fellini's Nights of Cabiria by a single vote. Khan was utterly disappointed at not winning the award. \"He had seen the other films in the fray and believed Mother India was far superior to them\" recalled Sunil Dutt years later. It also won two awards at the 5th National Film Awards in 1957: an All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film and Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film in Hindi. The score and soundtrack for Mother India was composed by Naushad. Mehboob Khan had worked on eight\u00a0films with Naushad and developed a rapport with him. The lyrics were by Shakeel Badayuni. The soundtrack consists of 12\u00a0songs and features vocals by Mohammed Rafi, Shamshad Begum, Lata Mangeshkar, and Manna Dey. It was not particularly well received upon release, and critics said it did not match the high pitch and quality of the film. However, its later reception has been more positive: the soundtrack made Planet Bollywood's list of \"100 Greatest Bollywood Soundtracks Ever\", compiled in the 2000s. The review gave the album 7.5 stars out of 10. Mother India is the earliest example of a Hindi film containing Western classical music and Hollywood-style orchestra. An example is a coda during the scene in which Birju runs away from his mother and rejects her. It features a powerful symphonic orchestra with strings, woodwinds and trumpets. This orchestral music contains extensive chromaticism, diminished sevenths, and augmented scales. It also features violin tremolos. Anne Morcom writes in Hindi Film Songs and the Cinema that the piece is unmelodic and \"profoundly disturbing\". This use of a western-style orchestra in Indian cinema influenced many later films, such as Mughal-e-Azam (1960), which features similar dissonant orchestral music to create atmosphere at tense moments. The song \"Holi Aayi Re Kanhai\", sung by Shamshad Begum, has been cited as a typical Hindi film song which is written for and sung by a female singer, with an emotional charge that appeals to a mass audience. Mother India has been described as \"perhaps India's most revered film\", a \"cinematic epic\", a \"flag-bearer of Hindi cinema and a legend in its own right\", Mehboob Khan's magnum opus and an \"all-time blockbuster\", which ranks highly among India's most successful films. It was in continuous distribution, being played in theatres, for more than three decades; the record ended in the mid-1990s with the advent of satellite television and a change in Indian film-viewing habits. Mother India belongs to only a small collection of films, including Kismet (1943), Mughal-e-Azam (1960), Sholay (1975) Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994), and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) which are repeatedly watched throughout India and are viewed as definitive Hindi films with cultural significance. It is also among the only three Indian films to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (the others being Salaam Bombay! and Lagaan). The Hindustan Times (in 2007) identifies the \"film's pungent social references\" which are \"too harsh to be sold at a profit today. But this heartrending tale filled Indians with hope and pride then.\" Mother India is ranked No. 80 in Empire magazine's \"The 100\u00a0Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010. It is listed among the only three Hindi films in the book 1001\u00a0Movies You Must See Before You Die (the others being Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Deewaar). Film critic Anupama Chopra included it in her list of top 100 films in world cinema. In 2005, Indiatimes Movies ranked the film amongst the \"Top 25\u00a0Must See Bollywood Films\". It was ranked third in the British Film Institute's 2002 poll of \"Top 10\u00a0Indian Films\". It was also included TIME's list of the best Bollywood classics in 2010, and in CNN-IBN's list of the \"100 greatest Indian films of all time\" in 2013. The film was premiered in the Cannes Classics section of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN notes that Mother India \"didn't just put India on the world map, it also defined Hindi cinema for decades that followed.\" Film critic Dave Kehr agrees that it influenced Indian films for the next 50 years. A 1983 Channel 4 documentary on Hindi cinema describes the film as setting a benchmark in Indian cinema. The shooting stance of Nargis at the end of the film is one of the all-time iconic images of Hindi cinema. Other iconic scenes include Radha pulling the plough through the field (see film poster at the top) and feeding chapatis to her two sons as they pull the plough. The Hindustan Times states that Nargis symbolised mothers in \"which all the mothers [in later films] had the same clich\u00e9d roles to play. Representing both motherhood and Mother Earth, who also nurtures and occasionally punishes, Nargis immortalised the Indian mother on celluloid.\" The film pioneered the portrayal of two morally opposed brothers personifying good and evil, which became a repeated motif in Hindi films, including Gunga Jumna (1961) and Deewar (1975). The rebellious Birju also inspired the \"angry young man\" stock character that arose in 1970s Hindi cinema.",

        "full_text": " Mr. Natwarlal is a 1979 Hindi action comedy film produced by Tony Glaad (as \"Tony\") and directed by Rakesh Kumar. The film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Rekha, Ajit Khan and Amjad Khan. The music is by Rajesh Roshan, the songs are written by Anand Bakshi. The highlight of the film was a children's song sung by Amitabh Bachchan. Ishraq-Suja, known for writing a novel named \"Shadman & Zarin er Bhalobasha\", made their first filmwriting debut with this film. Tony decided to take them as the writer of the film. The film was shot in Kashmir with most of the shooting done in Beerwah, Jammu and Kashmir The name of film and lead character were inspired from a notorious Indian conman, Natwarlal. Getting Amitabh to sing was a gimmick that was tried for the first time in this movie. Kabhi Kabhi earlier had Amitabh use spoken verse within a melodic song, but this was the first time he sang in a movie. This was subsequently copied by other filmmakers in films like Laawaris, Silsila and Pukar.

        "full_text": " Mughal-e-Azam (English: The Emperor of the Mughals) is a 1960 Indian epic historical drama film directed by K. Asif and produced by Shapoorji Pallonji. Starring Prithviraj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Madhubala, and Durga Khote, it follows the love affair between Mughal Prince Salim\u00a0(who went on to become Emperor Jahangir) and Anarkali, a court dancer. Salim's father, Emperor Akbar, disapproves of the relationship, which leads to a war between father and son. The development of Mughal-e-Azam began in 1944, when Asif read a play set in the reign of Emperor Akbar (1556\u20131605). Production was plagued by delays and financial uncertainty. Before its principal photography began in the early 1950s, the project had lost a financier and undergone a complete change of cast. Mughal-e-Azam cost more to produce than any previous Indian motion picture; the budget for a single song sequence exceeded that typical for an entire film of the period. The soundtrack, inspired by Indian classical and folk music, comprises 12 songs voiced by playback singers including Lata Mangeshkar and classical singer Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, and is often cited among the finest in Bollywood cinematic history. Mughal-e-Azam had the widest release of any Indian film up to that time, and patrons often queued all day for tickets. Released on 5 August 1960, it broke box office records in India and became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time, a distinction it held for 15 years. The accolades awarded to the film include one National Film Award and three Filmfare Awards at the 8th Filmfare Awards. Mughal-e-Azam was the first black-and-white Hindi film to be digitally coloured, and the first in any language to be given a theatrical re-release. The colour version, released in November 2004, was a commercial success. The film is widely considered to be a milestone of its genre, earning praise from critics for its grandeur and attention to detail. Film scholars have welcomed its portrayal of enduring themes, but question its historical accuracy.   Emperor Akbar (Prithviraj Kapoor), who does not have a male heir, undertakes a pilgrimage to a shrine to pray that his wife Jodhabai (Durga Khote) give birth to a son. Later, a maid brings the emperor news of his son's birth. Overjoyed at his prayers being answered, Akbar gives the maid his ring, and promises to grant her anything she desires. The son, Prince Salim, grows up to be spoiled, flippant, and self-indulgent. His father sends him off to war, to teach him courage and discipline. Fourteen years later, Salim returns as a distinguished soldier (Dilip Kumar) and falls in love with court dancer Nadira, whom the emperor has renamed Anarkali (Madhubala), meaning pomegranate blossom. The relationship is discovered by the jealous Bahar (Nigar Sultana), a dancer of a higher rank, who wants the prince to love her so that she may one day become queen. Unsuccessful in winning Salim's love, she exposes his forbidden relationship with Anarkali. Salim pleads to marry Anarkali, but his father refuses, and imprisons her. Despite her treatment, Anarkali refuses to reject Salim, as Akbar demands. Salim rebels and amasses an army to confront Akbar and rescue Anarkali. Defeated in battle, Salim is sentenced to death by his father, but is told that the sentence will be revoked if Anarkali, now in hiding, is handed over to die in his place. Anarkali gives herself up to save the prince's life, and is condemned to death by being entombed alive. Before her sentence is carried out, she begs to have a few hours with Salim as his make-believe wife. Her request is granted, as she has agreed to drug Salim so that he cannot interfere with her entombment. As Anarkali is being walled up, Akbar is reminded that he still owes her mother a favour, as it was she who brought him news of Salim's birth. Anarkali's mother pleads for her daughter's life. The emperor has a change of heart, but although he wants to release Anarkali he cannot, because of his duty to his country. He therefore arranges for her secret escape into exile with her mother, but demands that the pair are to live in obscurity, and that Salim is never to know that Anarkali is still alive. The Urdu dramatist Imtiaz Ali Taj wrote a play about the love story of Salim and Anarkali in 1922, based more on a 16th-century legend than on fact. A stage version was soon produced, and screen versions followed. Ardeshir Irani made a silent film, Anarkali, in 1928, and remade it with sound in 1935. In the early 1940s, the tale of Anarkali inspired producer Shiraz Ali Hakeem and young director K. Asif (Karimuddin Asif) to make another film adaptation which they would title Mughal-e-Azam. They recruited four Urdu writers to develop the screenplay and dialogue: Aman (Zeenat Aman's father, also known as Amanullah Khan), Wajahat Mirza, Kamaal Amrohi, and Ehsan Rizvi. It is not known how the writers collaborated or shared out their work, but in 2010 The Times of India said that their \"mastery over Urdu's poetic idiom and expression is present in every line, giving the film, with its rich plots and intricate characters, the overtones of a Shakespearean drama.\" As the script neared completion, Asif cast Chandra Mohan, D.K. Sapru, and Nargis for the roles of Akbar, Salim, and Anarkali, respectively. Shooting started in 1946 in Bombay Talkies studio. The project faced multiple hurdles, which forced its temporary abandonment. The political tensions and communal rioting surrounding India's 1947 partition and independence stalled production. Shortly after partition, Shiraz Ali migrated to Pakistan, leaving Asif without a financier. The actor Chandra Mohan suffered a heart attack and died in 1949. Shiraz Ali had previously suggested that business tycoon Shapoorji Pallonji could finance the film. Although Pallonji knew nothing about film production, in 1950 he agreed to produce the film because of his interest in the history of Akbar. Production was then restarted with a new cast. Believing that the film had been cancelled, Kamal Amrohi, one of the scriptwriters who was also a director, planned to make a film on the same subject himself. When confronted by Asif, he agreed to shelve the project. Another unrelated film production based on the same stage play was Nandlal Jaswantlal's Anarkali, starring Bina Rai and Pradeep Kumar, which became the highest grossing Bollywood film of 1953. Asif had initially rejected Dilip Kumar for the part of Prince Salim. Kumar was reluctant to act in a period film, but accepted the role upon the insistence of the film's producer. According to Kumar, \"Asif trusted me enough to leave the delineation of Salim completely to me.\" Kumar faced difficulty while filming in Rajasthan owing to the heat and the body armour he wore. The part of Anarkali had first been offered to Suraiya but later went to Madhubala, who had been longing for a significant role. Madhubala suffered from congenital heart disease, which was one of the reasons why at times she fainted on set; she also endured skin abrasions while filming the prison sequences, but was determined to finish the film. To become the character of Emperor Akbar, Prithviraj Kapoor was reported to have \"relied completely on the script and director\". Prior to make-up, Kapoor would declare, \"Prithviraj Kapoor ab jaa rahaa hai\" (\"Prithviraj Kapoor is now going\"); after make-up, he would announce, \"Akbar ab aa rahaa hai\" (\"Akbar is now coming\"). Kapoor faced difficulty with his heavy costumes, and suffered blisters on his feet after walking barefoot in the desert for a sequence. Lance Dane, a photographer who was on set during the filming, recalled that Kapoor struggled to remember his lines in some scenes; he mentioned one scene in particular that Kapoor required 19 takes to get right. At the time of filming, Kapoor who was on a diet, was told by Asif to regain the lost weight for his portrayal of Akbar. Zakir Hussain, who later became a tabla maestro, had initially been considered for the part of the young Prince Salim, but it became the debut role of Jalal Agha, who later performed on the song \"Mehbooba Mehbooba\" from Sholay (1975). The production design of the film, led by art director M. K. Syed, was extravagant, and some sets took six weeks to erect. The film, mostly shot in studio sets designed to represent the interior of a Mughal palace, featured opulent furnishings and water features such as fountains and pools, generating the feel of a Hollywood historical epic of the period. The song \"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya\" was filmed in Mohan Studios on a set built as a replica of the Sheesh Mahal in the Lahore Fort. The set was noted for its size, measuring 150 feet (46\u00a0m) in length, 80 feet (24\u00a0m) in breadth and 35 feet (11\u00a0m) in height. A much-discussed aspect was the presence of numerous small mirrors made of Belgian glass, which were crafted and designed by workers from Firozabad. The set took two years to build and cost more than \u20b91.5 million (valued at about US$314,000 in 1960),[a] more than the budget of an entire Bollywood film at the time. The film's financiers feared bankruptcy as a result of the high cost of production. Artisans from across India were recruited to craft the props. The costumes were designed by Makhanlal and Company, and Delhi-based tailors skilled in zardozi embroidery stitched the Mughal costume. The footwear was ordered from Agra, the jewellery was made by goldsmiths in Hyderabad, the crowns were designed in Kolhapur, and blacksmiths from Rajasthan manufactured the armoury (which included shields, swords, spears, daggers, and armour). The zardozi on costumes were also stitched by designers from Surat. A statue of Lord Krishna, to which Jodhabai prayed, was made of gold. In the scenes involving an imprisoned Anarkali, real chains were placed on Madhubala. The battle sequence between Akbar and Salim reportedly featured 2,000 camels, 400 horses, and 8,000 troops, mainly from the Indian Army's Jaipur cavalry, 56th Regiment. Dilip Kumar has spoken of the intense heat during filming of the sequence in the desert of Rajasthan, wearing full armour. Principal photography for Mughal-e-Azam began in the early 1950s. Each sequence was reportedly filmed three times, as the film was being produced in Hindi/Urdu, Tamil, and English. The film was eventually dubbed in Tamil and released as Akbar, but that version's commercial failure resulted in the abandonment of the planned English dubbing, for which British actors were considered. Asif was accompanied by an extensive crew, which included his assistant directors S. T. Zaidi, Khalid Akhtar, Surinder Kapoor (assisting primarily for the English version), and five others. Additional crew members included cinematographer R. D. Mathur, choreographer Lachhu Maharaj, production manager Aslam Noori, cameraman M. D. Ayub, editor Dharamavir, makeup artists P. G. Joshi and Abdul Hamid, and sound director Akram Shaikh. Some film sequences were shot with up to 14 cameras, significantly more than the norm at that time. There were many difficulties with the film's lighting; cinematographer Mathur reportedly took eight hours to light a single shot. In total, 500 days of shooting were needed, compared to a normal schedule of 60 to 125 shooting days at the time. Owing to the very large size of the Sheesh Mahal set, the lighting was provided by the headlights of 500 trucks and about 100 reflectors. The presence of the mirrors on the set caused problems, as they sparkled under the lights. Foreign consultants, including British director David Lean, told Asif to forget the idea since they felt that it was impossible to film the scene under the intense glare. Asif confined himself to the set with the lighting crew, and subsequently overcame the problem by covering all the mirrors with a thin layer of wax, thereby subduing their reflectivity. Mathur also used strategically placed strips of cloth to implement \"bounce lighting\", which reduced the glare. Such was the all-round commitment that nobody saw the delay as tiresome. We were experienced enough to know that a film involving such overwhelming craftsmanship, minute detailing, massive gathering of artistes and unit hands, strenuous schedules with large units of artistes and trained animals, day and night shoots cannot be a simple affair. A number of problems and production delays were encountered during filming, to the extent that at one point Asif considered abandoning the project. Kumar defended the long duration of filming, invoking the massive logistics of the film and explaining that the entire cast and crew were \"acutely conscious of the hard work [they] would have to put in, as well as the responsibility [they] would have to shoulder.\" The production also suffered from financial problems, and Asif exceeded the budget on a number of occasions. The final budget of the film is a subject of debate. Some sources state that Mughal-e-Azam cost \u20b910.5 million to produce (about US$2 million at the time), while others claim that it cost \u20b915\u00a0million, about $3 million. This made Mughal-e-Azam the most expensive Indian film of the period. A number of estimates put the film's inflation-adjusted budget at \u20b9500 million to \u20b92\u00a0billion. The budget situation strained the relationship between Asif and Pallonji, while the production also faced troubled relationships among other crew members; differences crept up between Asif and Kumar when the former married the latter's sister. Another source of trouble was the romantic relationship and ultimate break-up of Kumar and Madhubala, who had been dating for nine years. Sohrab Modi's Jhansi Ki Rani (1953) was the first Indian film to be shot in colour, and by 1957, colour production had become increasingly common. Asif filmed one reel of Mughal-e-Azam, including the song \"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya\", in Technicolor. Impressed by the result, he filmed three more reels in Technicolor, near the story's climax. After seeing them, he sought a complete re-shoot in Technicolor, angering impatient distributors who were unwilling to accept further delays. Asif subsequently released Mughal-e-Azam partially coloured, although he still hoped to see the full film in colour. By the end of filming, more than a million feet of negative had been used, necessitating significant editing. A number of songs were edited out owing to the running time, which in the end was 197 minutes. Almost half of the songs recorded for the film were left out of the final version. Mughal-e-Azam is a family history highlighting the differences between father and son, duty to the public over family, and the trials and tribulations of women, particularly of courtesans. According to Rachel Dwyer, author of the book Filming the Gods: Religion and Indian Cinema, the film highlights religious tolerance between Hindus and Muslims. Examples include the scenes of Hindu Queen Jodahabai's presence in the court of the Muslim Akbar, the singing of a Hindu devotional song by Anarkali, and Akbar's participation in the Janmashtami celebrations, during which Akbar is shown pulling a string to rock a swing with an idol of Krishna on it. Film critic Mukul Kesavan has remarked that he was unable to recall a single other film about Hindu-Muslim love in which the woman (Jodhabai) is Hindu. Scholars Bhaskar and Allen described the film as a tableau vivant of \"Islamicate culture\", evidenced in its ornate sets, musical sequences such as the qawwali scene, and chaste Urdu dialogues. Throughout the film there is a distinct depiction of Muslims as the ruling class who not only dressed differently but also spoke in complex Persianised dialogue. They are made to appear \"distinct and separate from the mainstream.\" Film scholar Stephen Teo posits that Mughal-e-Azam is a \"national allegory\", a stylistic way of appropriating history and heritage to emphasise the national identity. He believes the arrogance of Bahar represents the power of the state and that Anarkali's emotion, which is highly personal, represents the private individual. Teo states that the theme of romantic love defeating social class difference and power hierarchy, as well as the grandeur of the filming, contribute to the film's attractiveness. Author Ashis Nandy has commented on the poetic quality of the dialogue, saying that \"the characters of Mughal-e-Azam do not just speak\u00a0\u2013 they refine communication, they distil it, they crystallize it into many faceted glittering gems, they make poetry of ordinary language.\" Gowri Ramnarayan of The Hindu has also emphasised the power of the dialogues in the film in that they \"create not only the ambiance of this period drama, but also etch character and situation. Every syllable breathes power and emotion.\" Philip Lutgendorf, a scholar at the University of Iowa, has stated that while the theme of the conflict between passionate individual love and family duty may be very common in Hindi film making, with endless cinematic permutations, K. Asif's \"excessive elaboration of the theme remains in a class by itself.\" Further, Emperor Akbar struggles between his personal desires and his duties to the nation. Ashis Nandy noted that apart from the conflict between Akbar and his son, there is also an \"unwritten alliance\" between Akbar and Bahar that compounds the problems of Anarkali. He also thought it highlighted the \"idea of justice and the notion of unconditional love\" to uphold tradition. The song \"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya\" sung by Anarkali was an indication of her defiance of societal norms. A major difference from the original story is that while the earlier Anarakali films based on Imtiaz Ali Taj's story ended as tragedies, K. Asif created a relatively happy ending in that Akbar gives amnesty to Anarkali by allowing her to escape through a secret route of tunnels below a false bottom of her prison wall, although his son is made to suffer in believing her to have perished. The film is based on a legend, but it is given credence by at least two texts that assert Anarkali's existence during the historical period of the greatest monarch of the Mughal Empire, Emperor Akbar (1556\u20131605). One of the books states that in 1615 a marble tomb was built on Anarkali's grave in Lahore by Salim, when he had become Emperor Jehangir. On the tomb is a Persian inscription that reads: \"Ta Kiyamat shukr geom kardgate khwesh ra, Aah garman bez benaam roo-e yare khwesh ra\", meaning in English: \"Ah! could I behold the face of my love once more, I would give thanks to my God until the day of resurrection.\" The author of the stage play on which the film is based, Imtiaz Ali Taj, believed that the legend had no historical base, but historians have suggested that Anarkali may have been a painter, a dancer, or a courtesan, or one of Akbar's wives and the mother of Salim's half-brother Prince Daniyal. While an earlier film version of the story, Anarkali (1952), contained a disclaimer stating that the story had no foundation in history, Mughal-e-Azam made no such claim. Mughal-e-Azam takes numerous liberties with historical fact. Historian Alex von Tunzelmann says that although the real Salim was a heavy consumer of alcohol and opium from the age of 18, he was not necessarily a mischievous boy, as depicted in the film. When the film's Salim returns from his time in the military, he is depicted as a gentle and romantic hero, in contrast to the real Salim, who was documented as a brutal drunk who would often beat people to death. The real Salim did lead a rebellion against his father, tried to replace him as emperor, and had Akbar's friend Abu al-Fazl murdered in 1602, but the film ascribes these actions to his desire to marry Anarkali, which is historically inaccurate. Further, there were also discrepancies in sets, costumes, and music of the film. The Sheesh Mahal, actually the royal bath of the queen, was depicted in the film as a dancing hall, and much larger. Music and dancing styles from the 19th century were depicted, although the story takes place in the 16th century. For example, thumri, a semi-classical music form developed in the 19th century, is adopted in a dance sequence in Kathak style, which is a 16th-century dance form. The soundtrack was composed by music director Naushad, and the lyrics were written by Shakeel Badayuni. After conceiving the idea of the film, Asif visited Naushad and handed him a briefcase containing money, telling him to make \"memorable music\" for Mughal-e-Azam. Offended by the explicit notion of money as a means of gaining quality, Naushad threw the notes out of the window, to the surprise of his wife. She subsequently made peace between the two men, and Asif apologised. With this, Naushad accepted the offer to direct the film's soundtrack. As with most of Naushad's soundtracks, the songs of Mughal-e-Azam were heavily inspired by Indian classical music and folk music, particularly ragas such as Darbari, Durga, used in the composition of \"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya\", and Kedar, used in \"Bekas Pe Karam Keejeye\". He also made extensive use of symphony orchestras and choruses to add grandeur to the music. The soundtrack contained a total of 12 songs, which were rendered by playback singers and classical music artists. These songs account for nearly one third of the film's running time. A total of 20 songs were composed for the film, at an average cost of \u20b93,000 (valued at about US$629 in 1960)[a] per song, though many were left out of the final cut owing to the film's length. Both Asif and Naushad approached Hindustani classical vocalist Bade Ghulam Ali Khan inviting him to participate in the film's soundtrack, but he refused, explaining that he disliked working in films. Asif, adamant about the presence of Khan, asked him to name his fee. Khan quoted a fee of \u20b925,000 per song, at a time when Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi (the best paid playback singers of the time) charged \u20b9300\u2013400 per song, thinking that Asif would send him away. Instead, Asif agreed, and even gave Khan a 50 per cent advance. Surprised and left with no excuse to turn down the offer, he finally accepted. Khan sang two songs, \"Prem Jogan Ban Ke\" and \"Shubh Din Aayo\"; both were included in the final version of the film and demonstrated the artist's vocal virtuosity. The composition of \"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya\" was especially time-consuming\u00a0\u2013 on the day of the song's scheduled recording, Naushad rejected two sets of lyrics by Badayuni. Subsequently, a \"brainstorming session\" was held on Naushad's terrace, beginning in early evening and lasting until next day. Late in the night, Naushad remembered a folk song from eastern Uttar Pradesh with the lyrics \"Prem kiya, kya chori kari hai...\" (\"I have loved, does it mean that I have stolen?\"). The song was converted into a ghazal and subsequently recorded. At that time, since there was no technology to provide for the reverberation of sound heard in the song, Naushad had Mangeshkar sing the song in a studio bathroom. Some sources state that a chorus of a hundred singers supported singer Mohammed Rafi for the song \"Ae Mohabbat Zindabad\", though other sources place the number at a thousand. The song \"Mohe Panghat Pe\" was objected to by veteran director Vijay Bhatt. Although he was not directly involved with the project, he thought that it would \"ruin the film\", since it showed the Mughal emperor celebrating the Hindu festival Janmashtami. Though Naushad argued that the presence of Jodhabai made the situation logical, he met with the film's screenwriters and subsequently added dialogue that explained the sequence. When the film was colourised for re-release, the soundtrack was also reworked, with original composer Naushad receiving help from Uttam Singh. The score remained the same, but the sound was touched up and converted to Dolby Digital. The orchestral part was re-recorded with live musicians, but the original solo vocals were retained. The cost was reported to be between \u20b92.6 million (US$40,000) and \u20b96.5 million (US$100,000). The soundtrack of Mughal-e-Azam received universal acclaim from critics in India. It is often cited as one of the best soundtracks in Bollywood history, and was one of the best-selling Bollywood albums of the 1960s. Shahid Khan, writing for Planet Bollywood, gave the soundtrack ten out of ten stars and called the music the \"soul of the film\". In 2004, Subhash K. Jha reviewed the re-mastered release of the soundtrack, praising the technical quality of the re-release and the original vocals of Lata Mangeshkar. In 2013, Baldev S Chauhan of Sun Post called the songs \"some of the greatest songs of Hindi cinema.\" All lyrics written by Shakeel Badayuni; all music composed by Naushad. \"Asif's logic was very clear\u00a0\u2013 he had made a film which everyone associated with it would be proud of for generations. And he was proved right.\" At the time of the release of Mughal-e-Azam, a typical Bollywood film would garner a distribution fee of \u20b9300,000\u2013400,000 (about US$63,000\u201384,000 in 1960)[a] per territory. Asif insisted that he would sell his film to the distributors at no less than \u20b9700,000 per territory. Subsequently, the film was actually sold at a price of \u20b91.7\u00a0million (US$356,000)[a] per territory, surprising Asif and the producers. Thus, it set the record for the highest distribution fee received by any Bollywood film at that time. The premiere of Mughal-e-Azam was held at the then-new 1,100-capacity Maratha Mandir cinema in Mumbai. Mirroring the nature of the film, the cinema's foyer had been decorated to resemble a Mughal palace, and a 40-foot (12\u00a0m) cut-out of Prithviraj Kapoor was erected outside it. The Sheesh Mahal set was transported from the studio to the cinema, where ticket holders could go inside and experience its grandeur. Invitations to the premiere were sent as \"royal invites\" shaped like scrolls, which were written in Urdu and made to look like the Akbarnama, the official chronicle of the reign of Akbar. The premiere was held amidst great fanfare, with large crowds and an extensive media presence, in addition to hosting much of the film industry, although Dilip Kumar did not attend the event owing to his dispute with Asif. The film's reels arrived at the premiere cinema atop a decorated elephant, accompanied by the music of bugles and shehnai. The day before bookings for the film opened, a reported crowd of 100,000 gathered outside the Maratha Mandir to buy tickets. The tickets, the most expensive for a Bollywood film at that time, were dockets containing text, photographs and trivia about the film, and are now considered collector's items. They sold for \u20b9100 (valued at about US$21 in 1960),[a] compared to the usual price of \u20b91.5 (US$0.31).[a] Bookings experienced major chaos, to the extent that police intervention was required. It was reported that people would wait in queues for four to five days, and would be supplied food from home through their family members. Subsequently, the Maratha Mandir closed bookings for three weeks. Mughal-e-Azam was released on 5 August 1960 in 150\u00a0cinemas across the country, establishing a record for the widest release for a Bollywood film. It became a major commercial success, earning \u20b94\u00a0million (US$839,000)[a] in the first week, eventually earning a net revenue of \u20b955\u00a0million (US$11,530,000),[a] and generating a profit of \u20b930\u00a0million for the producers. Mughal-e-Azam also experienced a long theatrical run, screening to full capacity at the Maratha Mandir for three years. The film thus became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time by surpassing Mother India (1957), and retained this record until Sholay (1975) surpassed its net revenue. The Hindu stated in 2009 that Mughal-e-Azam was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time if adjusted for inflation. According to the online box office website Box Office India, the film's adjusted net revenue would amount to \u20b91327\u00a0million, ranking it as an \"All-Time Blockbuster\". The trade magazine Box Office implemented a formula for adjusting box office collections in 2011. Using the base price of gold and growth of multiplexes as factors, they calculated that Mughal-e-Azam was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time. Mughal-e-Azam received almost universal acclaim from Indian critics; every aspect of the film was praised. A review from the 1960s in Filmfare called it a \"history-making film\u00a0... the work of a team of creative artists drawn from different spheres of the art world\". It was also described as \"a tribute to imagination, hard work and lavishness of its maker, Mr. Asif. For its grandeur, its beauty, and then performances of the artists it should be a landmark in Indian films.\" Since 2000, reviewers have described the film as a \"classic\", \"benchmark\", or \"milestone\" in the history of Indian cinema. In 2011, Anupama Chopra called it \"the best Hindi film ever made\" and \"the apotheosis of the Hindi film form\", noting specifically the performances, father-son drama and song sequences. Dinesh Raheja of Rediff called the film a must-see classic, saying \"a work of art is the only phrase to describe this historical whose grand palaces-and-fountains look has an epic sweep and whose heart-wrenching core of romance has the tenderness of a feather's touch.\" Sujata Gupta of Planet Bollywood gave the film nine out of ten stars, calling it a \"must see\" that \"has captured interest of people over generations\". K. K. Rai, in his review for Stardust stated, \"it can be said that the grandeur and vintage character of Mughal-e-Azam cannot be repeated, and it will remembered as one of the most significant films made in this country.\" Ziya Us Salam of The Hindu described Mughal-e-Azam as a film people will want to watch over and over again. Raja Sen of Rediff compared the film to Spartacus (1960) and said, \"Mughal-e-Azam is awesomely, stunningly overwhelming, a magnificent spectacle entirely free of CGI and nonlinear gimmickry, a gargantuan feat of\u00a0... of\u00a0... well, of Mughal proportions!\" Laura Bushell of the BBC rated the film four out of five stars, considering it to be a \"benchmark film for both Indian cinema and cinema grandeur in general\", and remarking that Mughal-E-Azam was an epic film in every way. Naman Ramachandran, reviewing the film for the British Film Institute, noted the depiction of religious tolerance and said the film had a tender heart. Nasreen Munni Kabir, author of The Immortal Dialogue of K. Asif's Mughal-e-Azam, compared the film to the Koh-i-Noor diamond for its enduring worth to Indian cinema. Outlook, in 2008, and Hindustan Times, in 2011, both declared that the scene in which Salim brushes Anarkali with an ostrich feather was the most erotic and sensuous scene in the history of Indian cinema. At the 1961 National Film Awards, Mughal-e-Azam won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. In the 1961 Filmfare Awards, Mughal-e-Azam was nominated in seven categories: Best Film, Best Director (Asif), Best Actress (Madhubala), Best Playback Singer (Mangeshkar), Best Music (Naushad), Best Cinematography (Mathur), and Best Dialogue (Aman, Wajahat Mirza, Kamaal Amrohi, and Ehsan Rizvi), winning the awards for Best Film, Best Cinematography, and Best Dialogue. Mughal-e-Azam was the first black-and-white Hindi film to be digitally coloured and the first to be given a theatrical re-release. The Sterling Investment Corporation, the negative rights owner  and an arm of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, undertook restoration and colourisation of Mughal-e-Azam and assigned Deepesh Salgia as Project Designer and Director. They initially approached Hollywood executives for help, but found the sales quotations, ranging from $12\u201315 million, too high. In 2002, Umar Siddiqui, managing director of the Indian Academy of Arts and Animation (IAAA), proposed to enhance it digitally at a fraction of the cost. To convince the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, one of India's wealthiest companies, of the commercial viability of the project, the IAAA colourised a four-minute clip and showed it to them. They approved and gave the project the go-ahead. Shapoorji Mistry, grandson of producer Shapoorji Pallonji Mistry, thought it a fitting tribute to complete his grandfather's unfinished dream of colourising the entire film. The first step towards colourisation was the restoration of the original negatives, which were in poor condition owing to extensive printing of the negative during the original theatrical release. Costly and labour-intensive restoration was essential before colourisation could be carried out. The negative was cleaned of fungal growth, damaged portions were restored, and missing parts of frames were re-instated. After cleaning, each of the 300,000 frames of the negative was scanned into a 10 megabytes-sized file and then was digitally restored. The entire restoration work was undertaken by Acris Lab, Chennai. The dialogues in the original soundtrack were also in a bad state of preservation, which necessitated having the sound cleaned at Chace Studio in the United States. The background score and the entire musical track was recreated by Naushad and Uttam Singh. For the songs, the original voices of the singers like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar were extracted from the original mixed track and the same were recreated with re-recorded score in 6.1 surround sound. The process of colourisation was preceded by extensive research. The art departments visited museums and studied the literature for background on the typical colours of clothing worn at that time. Siddiqui studied the technology used for the colourisation of black-and-white Hollywood classics. The team also approached a number of experts for guidance and suggestions, including Dilip Kumar, production designer Nitin Chandrakant Desai, and a historian from the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. To undertake the colourisation, Siddiqui brought together a team of around 100 individuals, including computer engineers and software professionals, and organised a number of art departments. The entire project was co-ordinated by Deepesh Salgia, who partnered with companies including Iris Interactive and Rajtaru Studios to execute the colourisation. The task was controlled and supervised by the producers, who received daily updates and progress reports. The colourisation team spent 18 months developing software for colouring the frames, called \"Effects Plus\", which was designed to accept only those colours whose hue would match the shade of grey present in the original film. This ensured that the colours added were as close to the real colour as possible; the authenticity of the colouring was later verified when a costume used in the film was retrieved from a warehouse, and its colours were found to closely match those in the film. Every shot was finally hand-corrected to perfect the look. The actual colourisation process took a further 10 months to complete. Siddiqui said that it had \"been a painstaking process with men working round the clock to complete the project.\" The exact cost of the colourisation is disputed, with a wide variety of estimates ranging from \u20b920 million (US$310,000) to \u20b950 million, or \u20b9100 million. The film's colour version was released theatrically on 12 November 2004, in 150 prints across India, 65 of which were in Maharashtra. The new release premiered at the Eros Cinema in Mumbai. Dilip Kumar, who had not attended the original premiere, was in attendance. The colour version was edited to a running time of 177 minutes, as compared to the original version's 197 minutes. The new release also included a digital reworked soundtrack, produced with the assistance of Naushad, the original composer. The release on the festive Diwali weekend came with three other major releases: Veer-Zaara, Aitraaz, and Naach. It became the 19th highest grossing Bollywood film of the year, behind Aitraaz and Veer-Zaara (the top grosser), but ahead of Naach. Mughal-e-Azam became the first full-length feature film colourised for a theatrical re-release; although some Hollywood films had been colourised earlier, they were only available for home media. It was subsequently selected for seven international film festivals. Upon release, the film drew crowds to the cinemas, with an overall occupancy of 90 per cent. Subsequently, it completed a 25-week run. While some critics complained that the colours were \"psychedelic\" or \"unnatural\", others hailed the effort as a technological achievement. Film critic Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times remarked that while colourising was not a good idea for most black-and-white classics, it was perfect in this particular instance. He compared it to films by Cecil B. DeMille and to Gone With the Wind (1939) for its larger-than-life storytelling. The Guardian said that although the new version was an improvement, \"the fake colours tend to look flat and brash, detracting from cinematographer RD Mathur's elegantly composed shots.\" The BBC's Jaspreet Pandohar, observing that the film was \"restored in appealing candy-colours and high quality sound\", considered it a \"cross between Gone With the Wind and Ben-Hur\". Other critics have said that they prefer the black and white version. In 2006, Mughal-e-Azam became only the fourth Indian film certified for showing in Pakistan since the 1965 ban on Indian cinema, and was released with a premiere in Lahore. It was distributed by Nadeem Mandviwala Entertainment, at the request of Asif's son, Akbar Asif. A 3D version of the film was reported to have been planned in 2009, but was never released. Mughal-e-Azam is one of only two films directed by Asif; one of his unfinished projects was released posthumously as a tribute. Over time the title has become part of Bollywood vernacular, used to describe a project that is taking too long to complete. Art director Omung Kumar, who has designed sets for major Indian films such as Black (2005) and Saawariya (2007), said that he and others in his field look to Mughal-e-Azam as a source of inspiration for art direction. It has also been used as a model for the perfect love story, requiring directors to ensure lovers overcome obstacles. Following her success in the film, Madhubala could have gone on to land further major roles, but she was advised not to overwork owing to her heart condition, and had to withdraw from some productions that were already underway. The Guardian in 2013 cited Mughal-e-Azam as a \"landmark of cinema\" despite its historical inaccuracies, and the BBC stated in 2005 that it is \"widely considered one of Bollywood's most iconic films\". Imtiaz Ali of The Times of India in 2010 called it the \"most proto-typical, high involvement, expensive, passionate piece of work that Hindi cinema has ever produced\", one that \"set the standard for everything that will ever come after it\". It continues to be regarded by critics as the Indian equivalent of Gone with the Wind. Filmmaker Subhash Ghai was quoted in 2010 as saying that a film like this could never be repeated: \"Mughal-e-Azam is an all-time classic and has been the ultimate love story in Hindi cinema at all levels. So it will always remain alive for generations to come.\" To commemorate the film's anniversary, Asif's friend the actor and producer Shah Rukh Khan had his company Red Chillies Entertainment produce a documentary video titled Mughal-E-Azam\u00a0\u2013 A Tribute by a son to his father. Hosted by Khan, it includes interviews with Asif's family and Bollywood stars. Artist M. F. Husain created a series of paintings for the video, in which he re-imagined some memorable scenes. Interested in preserving the film for future generations, Khan noted that his father was originally cast in the film but did not complete it. When asked if Mughal-e-Azam should be remade, he retorted: \"It is the mother of all films; mothers cannot be remade\". No sequels have been made, but Maan Gaye Mughal-e-Azam (2008) paid tribute with its title and by including in its plot part of the original stage play; it received very poor ratings from critics. Mughal-e-Azam ranks on the lists of top Indian films, including the 2002 British Film Institute poll of Top 10 Indian Films, and Anupama Chopra's 2009 list The Best Bollywood Films. It is also included in CNN-IBN's 2013 list of the \"100 greatest Indian films of all time\". Rotten Tomatoes has sampled 10 reviewers and judged 90% of them to be positive, with an average rating of 7.9 out of 10. It is second on Box Office India's list of Biggest Blockbusters Ever in Hindi Cinema, and was named the greatest Bollywood film of all time by a poll celebrating 100 years of Indian cinema by British Asian weekly newspaper Eastern Eye in July 2013. It belongs to a small collection of films including Kismet (1943), Mother India (1957), Sholay (1975), and Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994), that are watched repeatedly throughout India and are viewed as definitive Hindi films of cultural significance. Books and documentaries made about the film include Shakil Warsi's Mughal-E-Azam\u00a0\u2013 An Epic of Eternal Love, published by Rupa in 2009. The name Mughal-e-Azam has been adopted by businesses, including a restaurant in Goregaon.",

        "full_text": " Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai is a 2001 Bollywood romance film directed by Satish Kaushik and produced by Vashu Bhagnani. The film was the debut performance of Tusshar Kapoor, who played alongside Kareena Kapoor. The film was an official remake of the 1998 Telugu super hit Tholi Prema. It was released on 25 May 2001 and was a surprise hit at the box office.   The story revolves around a sensitive young adult named Karan (Tusshar), who frequently skips college. Despite his poor academic performance, he displays other talents. He is clever, an excellent musician, and plays in a band. His father constantly expresses his disappointment in him which often leads to Karan having outbursts of frustration and anger. One day in a deserted street, he lays eyes on Pooja (Kareena Kapoor) for the first time and falls in love with her. Following this brief acquaintance, he looks all over for her, but fails to find her. He slowly begins to lose hope in his quest, stops playing music and decides to move to another city with his uncle. While on his way there, his car breaks down, and he is forced to hitch a ride. To his amazement, he finds Pooja in the driver's seat. As they introduce themselves, an accident occurs when a truck collides with their car, which subsequently falls into a valley. Karan and Pooja find themselves hanging from a cliff, and even though Karan manages to haul Pooja back up the steep cliff, he loses his grip and falls into the ravine. When Pooja regains consciousness, she assumes responsibility for Karan's death and offers to help in the search for his body. Meanwhile, Karan has survived the fall but is seriously injured and unconscious. He is found by a man who takes him to the hospital and soon after, Karan is reunited with his family. As he recovers, he reflects on how he should have confessed his love to Pooja in the few moments they were together. He also begins to focus on his education instead of his music. In time, Pooja arrives at his doorstep to apologize and offers her friendship. They become good friends and then Pooja tells Karan that she must leave for the United States for further studies. Devastated, he finally confesses his love for her. Pooja feels the same way and cannot deny her feelings for Karan, and promises that she will return to him once she completes her education. Karan agrees to patiently wait for her. Anu Malik composed the soundtrack for the movie, while Sameer penned the lyrics. The bonus track by KK was added 35 days after the original album was produced, when they had completed the shooting for Pyaar Re.[citation needed] It was a joint venture after seeing the emotional outburst within Tusshar, which highlighted the title track.[citation needed] The album was a big chartbuster album with songs like Mujhe Kuch Kehna Hai, Maine Koi Jaadu & others becoming rages. Anu Malik won many awards for the album and the soundtrack was in top ten albums of 2001.[citation needed] A sequel to the film was announced, however it will only feature Tusshar Kapoor, as Kareena Kapoor declined the role. Many sources also claim that the 2010 film Milenge Milenge (which also starred Kareena Kapoor), was an official sequel to Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai. This was not confirmed by the director, Satish Kaushik.",

        "full_text": " Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. is a 2003 Indian comedy drama film directed by Rajkumar Hirani (in his directorial debut) and produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra. The movie is based on English movie Patch Adams released back in 1998. The story involves protagonist Munna Bhai (Sanjay Dutt), a goon, going to medical school. He is helped by his sidekick, Circuit (Arshad Warsi). It stars Sanjay Dutt, Arshad Warsi, Jimmy Shergill, Gracy Singh, Boman Irani and Sunil Dutt and was later followed by a second film Lage Raho Munna Bhai, and became the first installment of the Munna Bhai film series. On 25 February 2016, Sanjay Dutt was released from Yerwada Central Jail after completing his sentence (2013-2016) for illegal possession of firearms in 1993. Vidhu Vinod Chopra announced on 29 September 2016 that production on the third Munna Bhai film starring Dutt in the title role will begin in 2017. It went on to win the 2004 National Film Award for Best Popular Film, and several Filmfare awards, including the Critics Award for Best Movie and Best Screenplay. At the box office, it achieved a silver jubilee status (25 week run) being one of only eight films to have achieved this status since the year 2000. In its 26th week of release the film could still be found playing on 257 screens throughout India.   Murli Prasad Sharma (Sanjay Dutt), nicknamed \"Munna Bhai\" (literally \"Brother Munna\") is a bhai or gunda: a crime don in the Mumbai underworld. Given that his father had wished him to be a medical doctor, he creates the faux Sri Hari Prasad Sharma Charitable Hospital (named after his father) and pretends to live in accordance with this wish whenever his father (Sunil Dutt) and mother (Rohini Hattangadi) visit him in Mumbai. One year, however, Munna's plan goes awry when Hari meets an old acquaintance, Dr. Asthana (Boman Irani) and the two older men decide to betroth Munna to Asthana's daughter, Dr. Suman \"Chinki\" (Gracy Singh). At this point the truth about Munna is revealed. Asthana insults Munna's parents and calls them \"fools\" for being ignorant of Munna's real life. Munna's father and mother, aghast and later heartbroken, leave for their village. Munna, in grief and despair, decides that the only way to redeem himself and to gain revenge for the humiliation suffered by his father at the hands of the spiteful Ashthana is to become a doctor. He decides to go to a medical college to obtain an MBBS degree. With the help of his right-hand man Circuit (Arshad Warsi) and others, Munna \"gains admission\" to a medical college, where he again encounters Dr. Asthana, who is the dean. His success there becomes dependent upon the (coerced) help of faculty member Dr. Rustam Pavri (Kurush Deboo). While Munna Bhai's skills as a medical doctor are minimal, he transforms those around him with the \"Jadoo Ki Jhappi\" (\"magical hug\")\u00a0\u2013 a method of comfort taught to Munna by his mother\u00a0\u2013 and the compassion he shows towards those in need. Despite the school's emphasis on mechanical, Cartesian, impersonal, often bureaucratic relationships between doctors and patients, Munna constantly seeks to impose a more empathetic, almost holistic, regimen. To this end, he defies all convention by treating a brain-dead man called \"Anand bhai\"(Yatin Karyekar) as if the man were able to perceive and understand normally; interacts on familiar but autocratic terms with patients; humiliates school bullies; effusively thanks a hitherto-underappreciated janitor; and encourages the patients themselves to make changes in their lives, so that they do not need drugs or surgery. Dr. Asthana, who perceives all this as symptoms of chaos, is unable to prevent it from expanding and gaining ground at his college. He becomes increasingly irrational, almost to the point of insanity. Repeatedly, this near-dementia is shown when he receives unwelcome tidings and he begins laughing in a way that implies that he has gone mad. This behaviour is explained early on as an attempt to practice \"laughter therapy\", an attempt that seems to have backfired\u00a0\u2013 Asthana's laughing serves more to convey his anger than diffuse it. Meanwhile, his daughter becomes increasingly fond of Munna, who in his turn becomes unreservedly infatuated with her. Some comedy appears here, because Munna is unaware that Dr. Suman and his childhood friend \"Chinki\" are one and the same; an ignorance that Suman hilariously exploits. Asthana tries several times to expel Munna but is often thwarted by Munna's wit or the affection with which the others at the college regard Munna, having gained superior self-esteem by his methods. Asthana keeps a challenge that Munna can stay in college only if he passes the exam under his supervision. Munna and other mates accept it. Meanwhile, cancer patient Zaheer (Jimmy Shergill) is in a dying state seeking help from Munna. But unfortunately he dies in Munna's arms. Eventually, Munna is shamed into leaving the college: His guilt for not being able to help a Zaheer gets the better of him. In the moments immediately following Munna's departure, Anand miraculously awakens from his vegetative state; at this point Suman gives a heartfelt speech wherein she criticises her father for having banished Munna, saying that to do so is to banish hope, compassion, love, and happiness from the college. Asthana eventually realises his folly. Munna later marries Dr. Suman, learning for the first time that she is \"Chinki\". The medical college\u00a0\u2013 under Rustam Pavri's management since Asthana's retirement\u00a0\u2013 begins to imitate Munna's radical methods of treatment. Munna and Suman open a hospital in Munna's home village, where they implement Munna's ideas daily. This, in addition to the birth of their offspring, earns Munna the nickname \"Munnabhai\u00a0\u2013 M.B.B.S. \u2013 Miya Biwi Bachhon Samet\" (literally \"Husband Wife with Children\"). Munna's parents reconcile with him. His sidekick Circuit marries and has a son, who is nicknamed \"Short Circuit\". As the film concludes, Anand, restored to normal mental health, narrates the story to children. During the production Shahrukh Khan was originally cast as Munna along with Sanjay Dutt as Zaheer but due to his back problems he was forced to turn down the film. Vivek Oberoi was considered for the role but in the end Sanjay Dutt took the role as Munna, which ultimately gave him an image make over and helped change the public perception of the controversial superstar; his real-life father Sunil Dutt returned to film after 10 years to play Munna's father. This is the first film in which real-life father and son Sunil and Sanjay appear together, although they both appeared in Reshma Aur Shera (1971), Rocky (1981) and Kshatriya (1993) but not in any scenes together. The original choice for Circuit's role was Makrand Deshpande. Arshad Warsi took over the role which proved to be a turning point for his career. The scenes of the Medical College were shot at the Agriculture College of Pune and Grant Medical College Mumbai. The music is composed by Anu Malik. Lyrics are penned by Abbas Tyrewala and Rahat Indori. Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. was the recipient of a number of awards. At the 2004 Filmfare awards, it received the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie, the Filmfare Best Screenplay Award, the Filmfare Best Dialogue Award, and the Filmfare Best Comedian Award in addition to four other nominations. It won a number of awards at the 2004 Zee Cine Awards including Best Debuting Director, Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Comic Role, Best Cinematography, and Best Dialogue. Other ceremonies include the 2004 National Film Awards where it won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film and the 2004 International Indian Film Academy Awards where it won the IIFA Best Comedian Award.",

Produced and directed by Prakash Mehra, it stars Amitabh Bachchan in his fifth of nine films with Prakash Mehra to date. The films also stars Vinod Khanna, Raakhee, Rekha and Amjad Khan. The film was the top grossing hit of 1978. The film was the third biggest hit of the decade after Sholay and Bobby. The film was such a huge hit, that people used to stand in queues, waiting endlessly, to buy the film's tickets. Sometimes the crowds slept in front of the cinema halls overnight in their wait for the tickets.[citation needed] Although it was nominated for several major Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, it failed to win in any category. It was remade into the Telugu film Prema Tarangalu (1980). and in Tamil as Amara Kaaviyam.   An orphan boy begins working in the house of a wealthy man named Ramnath (Shreeram Lagoo). Ramnath does not like him. It is later revealed that another orphan had killed his wife, hence his animosity. Ramnath's young daughter Kaamna, however, empathizes with the boy and they form a friendship. Eventually, the boy is adopted by a Muslim woman named Fatima (Nirupa Roy) who also works for Ramnath, and who names him Sikandar (meaning: Conqueror.) On the occasion of Kaamna's birthday, Sikandar is refused entry to the party, and when he breaks into Kaamna's room to deliver her gift he is caught and accused of trying to rob the house. He and his mother are banished from Ramnath's home. Shortly thereafter, Fatima dies, leaving young Sikandar with the responsibility of looking after her daughter, Mehroo. A fakir, Darvesh Baba (Kader Khan) advises the mourning Sikandar to embrace the woes of life and find happiness in sadness, for then he would become the conqueror of fate. The film cuts to grown up Sikandar (Amitabh Bachchan), revealing he has amassed a fortune by turning in smugglers and thieves to the police and receiving the reward payouts. With all his wealth, he has managed to build an impressive house for himself and Mehroo, along with setting up a profitable business. He still has not forgotten Kaamna (Raakhee). She and her father have fallen on hard times, but they snub all offers from Sikandar to become reacquainted. When Sikandar tries to speak to Kaamna she demands that he never speak to her again. Sikandar is upset by this and becomes a heavy drinker. He also begins to visit Zohra Begum's (Rekha) kotha (brothel) on a regular basis. Zohra falls into an unrequited love with Sikander and begins to refuse other clients. One night in a bar, Sikandar is introduced to Vishal Anand (Vinod Khanna), a down-on-his-luck lawyer. A friendship is formed when Vishal risks his own life to save Sikandar from a bomb blast. Vishal and his mother move into Sikandar's house. A criminal named Dilawar (Amjad Khan) is in love with Zohra, and learns about her love for Sikandar. Dilawar confronts Sikandar and in the ensuing fight is thrashed by him. He swears to kill Sikandar. At length Ramnath and Kaamna, who have been struggling financially, discover that Sikandar has been anonymously paying their bills. Ramnath goes to thank him. The two households become friendly, and Vishal begins to work with Ramnath. Encouraged, Sikandar tries to profess his love to Kaamna through a love letter. Because Sikandar himself is illiterate, Vishal transcribes the letter for him, but the plan backfires when Kaamna mistakes the letter as actually being from Vishal. Vishal is unaware that Kaamna is the girl Sikandar loves, and they begin to date. Sikandar, upon learning this, struggles with his emotions but decides he must sacrifice his love for the sake of his friendship with Vishal. He covers up any evidence of his feelings toward Kaamna, and at his urging, Vishal and Kaamna plan to marry. Meanwhile, the marriage of Mehroo is at risk of being cancelled; her fianc\u00e9's family have learned about Sikandar's frequent visits to Zohra, and they object to the union on these grounds. Vishal, knowing Sikandar won't change, visits Zohra and offers to pay her if she agrees to abandon Sikandar. Zohra, upon learning the reason, refuses the money but promises Vishal that she would rather die than let Sikandar visit her again. Later, Sikandar arrives at Zohra's. When she is unable to stop his entry, she kills herself by consuming poison hidden in her diamond ring, and dies in his arms. Dilawar in the meantime has formed an alliance with Sikandar's arch enemy, J. D. (Ranjeet), and upon learning of Zohra's death hatches a plan to destroy Sikandar and his family. Kaamna and Mehroo are both preparing for their weddings; J. D. and his henchmen kidnap Mehroo but Vishal follows them and rescues her. Dilawar kidnaps Kaamna, but Sikandar follows him. He rescues Kaamna and sends her home while he fights Dilawar. In the final battle, both Dilawar and Sikandar are mortally wounded and Dilawar is surprised to learn that Sikandar never loved Zohra. A dying Sikandar reaches the wedding of Kaamna and Vishal. Just as the wedding ceremony is completed, Sikandar collapses. His dying words inadvertently reveal his love for Kaamna, and Vishal sings him a reprise from the movie's theme song: \"Life is going to betray you someday... Death is your true love as it will take you along...\" Sikandar's entire life flashes before him and he dies in Vishal's arms just as the song is completed. The film ends with the wedding having become a funeral. The Soundtrack was composed by the duo of the brothers Kalyanji Anandji, with the lyrics by Anjaan and Prakash Mehra (Salaam-e-Ishq). Beside Kishore Kumar and Mahendra Kapoor, Mohd Rafi voice were used in the movie for Kishore Kumar songs Rote Hue Ate Hain Sab. Mohd Rafi wants Kishore Kumar to sing the sad version but as insisted by Music Director Kalyanji Anandji, that his voice suited most the sad version, Mohd Rafi has agreed to sing the song Zindagi to Bewafaa Hai. The song was pictured on Vinod Khanna while Amitabh death scene. Made on a budget of \u20b910 million (US$150,000), the film grossed over \u20b9170 million (US$2.6\u00a0million) in India, the film was the highest-grossing film of the year and the third highest-grossing film of the decade after Sholay (1975) and Bobby (1973).

        "full_text": " My Name Is Khan is a 2010 Indian thriller drama film directed by Karan Johar and produced by Hiroo Yash Johar and Gauri Khan and stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol in lead roles. The film was jointly produced by Dharma Productions and Red Chillies Entertainment and was distributed by FOX Star Entertainment, which had bought the rights for the film for a sum of \u20b9100 crore (US$15\u00a0million), making it the most expensive Bollywood film of 2010. It is also the highest buyover for any Indian film, surpassing Ghajini's record of \u20b990 crore (equivalent to \u20b9176\u00a0crore or US$27\u00a0million in 2016). Before its release, the film generated a great deal of publicity for itself due to three main reasons: first, the multiple political controversies surrounding the film and its lead actor; second, Khan's presence in the film (he was last seen in a leading actor role in December 2008, when Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi was released); and third, the reunion of the \"golden pair\" of Khan and Kajol, who last appeared together in the film Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham in 2001. My Name Is Khan debuted in Abu Dhabi, UAE, on 10 February 2010. It premiered globally in cinemas on 12 February 2010. It was also screened as part of the 60th Berlin International Film Festival's official selection the same month. Upon its release, the film broke many box office records. My Name Is Khan was the highest-grossing Bollywood film overseas at the time, which was then overtaken by 3 Idiots. Within four weeks, the film crossed the \u20b970 crore (US$11\u00a0million) mark in India and became the first film of 2010 to do so. In the overseas markets, the film grossed \u20b9110.34 crore (US$17\u00a0million). My Name Is Khan earned a worldwide gross of 200 crores. The film was released in India on DVD on 28 April 2010. Blu-ray in India, plus a DVD release worldwide followed on 10 August 2010.   Rizwan Khan is a Muslim child who grew up with his brother Zakir and his mother (Zarina Wahab) in a middle class family in the Borivali section of Mumbai. Rizwan is different from other children as he has autism. However, he has certain gifts, particularly a special ability to repair things. His difference leads to special tutoring from a reclusive scholar and extra attention from his mother, all which leads to a heightened level of jealousy from his brother Zakir, who eventually leaves his family for a life in the United States. Despite this initial resentment, as an adult Zakir sponsors Rizwan to come and live with him in San Francisco after the death of their mother. It is at this time that Zakir's wife, Haseena diagnoses Rizwan as having Asperger's syndrome. Rizwan also begins to work for Zakir and in the process he meets a Hindu woman, Mandira (Kajol) and her young son, Sameer, from a previous marriage. Despite Zakir's hostility to the match, they marry and settle down in the fictional town of Banville, where both Mandira and Sameer take Rizwan's last name as their own. They also live next door to the Garrick family, consisting of Mark, who is a reporter, his wife Sarah and son Reese. The couples perfect existence is disrupted after the September 11 attacks on the twin towers in New York City. Mark goes to cover the war in Afghanistan and dies there. At the same time, the Khan family begins to experience post 9-11 prejudice in their community and Reese begins to turn against Sameer as well. One afternoon, an argument between them turns into a racially motivated schoolyard fight between Sameer and a number of older students. Reese tries to stop the fight but is held back and Sameer dies from his injuries. A shattered Mandira blames Rizwan for his death stating that Sameer \"died only because his name was Khan.\" She then tells Rizwan that she no longer wants to be with him. When he asks her what he has to do in order for them to be together, she tells him that he has to tell the people of the United States and the President that his name is Khan and that he is not a terrorist . Rizwan thus sets out on a journey that takes him from one US state to another, in order to first meet President George W. Bush and later President-elect Barack Obama. During this quest, he travels to a small town in Georgia and befriends Mama Jenny and her son Joel. Later, in Los Angeles, he prays in a Mosque and overhears violent rhetoric from Faisal Rahman. He reports this to the FBI but there is no response at that moment. Later, while waiting in a crowd to meet President Bush and repeating again and again, \"My name is Khan and I am not a terrorist,\" Rizwan is arrested and placed in a prison by police who misinterpret his statement. While in the prison he is interrogated as a terrorist suspect and meets the psychiatrist Radha who believes he is innocent. He is later released after a media campaign by some Indian student reporters, who prove his innocence by unearthing his attempts to inform the FBI about Faisal Rahman. After his release, he returns to hurricane-hit Wilhemina to help Mama Jenny and her son. His efforts attract media attention and numerous Muslims come to help as well. At the same time, Reese confesses to Mandira and reveals the identity of the boys who beat up Sam. She informs Detective Garcia who has been assisting her on the case, and the boys are arrested. After they are brought to justice, she joins Rizwan in Georgia. At the moment she arrives, Rizwan is stabbed by a follower of Faisal Rahman and is rushed to the hospital. With Mandira's help, Rizwan survives and meets President-elect Barack Obama who tells him: \"Your name is Khan and you are not a terrorist.\" According to Karan Johar, writer, co-producer and director of My Name Is Khan, the film is about a multitude of perspectives of the various opinions, facts, and propaganda that comes with the global issue of discrimination and intolerance towards a race of people completely unassociated with the evils of terrorism. In an August 2009 interview, Shahrukh Khan stated that My Name Is Khan is \"not about terrorism, or 9/11. It's about a relationship between two people, between an individual and the State, and between an individual and the country. In short, there are the three important components: a love story, Islam, and a mild form of autism.\" \"I think it's an exceptionally relevant time, as the unity of our nation is of paramount importance, and I am very happy to witness such a movement in front of my eyes. We are all coming together to fight for a common cause \u2013 called humanity. Everyone knows that terrorism has no religion and it will never have a religion. As a filmmaker, I believe that I have a social responsibility and I promise to fulfill that.\" In an earlier July 2009 interview, Khan also noted that the film focuses on themes concerning \"the relationship between the Western world and Islam and how that has changed over the past few years.\" He describes the film as about \"the journey of one family and how it changes because of 9/11\" and suggests \"we touch upon that in a very unbiased and educated way.\" In another early interview, he also stated that, \"it's not about a disabled man's fight against disability. It's a disabled man's fight against the disability that exists in the world\u2014terrorism, hatred, fighting ... My Name Is Khan is also about Islam and the way the world looks at Islam but we are not taking any sides. We are only trying to say that there are only good people and bad people. There are no good Hindus, bad Hindus, good Christians, bad Christians. Either you are a good person or a bad person. Religion is not the criterion, humanity is.\" Karan Johar said in an interview with Bollywood Hungama: \"MNIK is an unusual Bollywood film, if at all, and doesn't have those quintessential pre-requisite elements that any Bollywood film has. It's telling a story with a strong message, professing humanity and goodness and putting it out on a big cinematic scale. So all put together it is definitely a different experience for mainstream India (...) All I can say is that MNIK is going to open windows and doors to many people who have stories to tell and are shy to put their story on the celluloid\" When asked about comparisons between the film and the 2009 release Kurbaan, noting that both have dealt with similar topics, he added: \"I'd say that Kurbaan didn't have 'hope', whereas MNIK had 'hope'. Kurbaan was more darker, grittier and a grey look at a situation, whereas MNIK is a hopeful, far more positive and a lot more positivity in its finishing reels with a triumph to the human spirit. Kurbaan was very cinematic and interesting in its approach but it didn't offer a solution. Rather it just tells the problem. MNIK offers you that solution.\" Production of the film took place in India and the United States. Filming began in Los Angeles during December 2008 and one of the locations used was UCLA. Johar next continued production in Mumbai during April 2009. During June 2009, production moved to San Francisco and the Bay Area, where they filmed a key scene at the Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose. Shahrukh Khan and Kajol were cast in the lead roles, reuniting them after many years. The film faced a temporary setback in late December when actor Aamir Bashir was denied a visa to the United States. He was eventually replaced by Jimmy Shergill as Khan's younger brother. Although Shabana Azmi was originally cast as Shahrukh Khan's mother she left the production after his shoulder injury delayed the filming schedule. She was replaced in the role by Zarina Wahab. Tanay Chheda portrayed Shahrukh Khan's character as a child living in the Borivali section of Mumbai. Chheda was chosen because he resembles Khan and because he is recognizable to an international audience after portraying \"middle Jamal\" in Slumdog Millionaire. He had earlier worked with Khan in the remake of the 1970s film Don: The Chase Begins Again. American actor Christopher B. Duncan was chosen to portray President Barack Obama. Duncan is known for his interpretation of Obama on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Johar had difficulties finding a mosque to film in. According to actor Arif Zakaria, \"I don't know if Karan tried to get permission in Mumbai. But we were to shoot in a mosque in Los Angeles and hard as Karan tried to convince the authorities that his film would not propagate anti-social values, he was denied permission [...] We finally shot the two-day scene with Shahrukh Khan on the set of a mosque constructed at The Club in Andheri.\" Johar also shot for an important scene inside of the studio of CBS 5 . San Francisco's Film Commission Director Stephanie Coyote was responsible for giving permission to the crew to shoot in the film studio. While shooting for the film, Khan suffered from severe pain in the neck and headaches which were caused by the expressions and posture of Rizwan Khan. His character in the film who has Asperger's Syndrome, has a way of jutting his neck out at a particular angle and wears an expression which has his eyebrows raised in every scene. As he would shoot for hours, he'd get severe migraines. Director Karan Johar admitted that \"Shahrukh's character Rizwan had to arch his eyebrows and focus his eyes on a certain place before every take. Halfway through the shooting of the film, Shah Rukh developed severe headaches as result of all the pressure it would put on his head so he had to see a neurosurgeon for that.\" After filming in Los Angeles was completed, Johar stated that, \"in all my 11 years as a filmmaker I've never felt the experience to be so different. The content of My Name Is Khan is diametrically opposite to whatever I've done in the past.\" He described working with both Shahrukh Khan and Kajol again as \"magic. They build an inexplicable energy on screen.\" Johar also stated that he was \"blown away by Shahrukh who had done monumental research on his autistic character in the film. I was zapped by how much he knew about the subject.\" Johar also asked Khan to co-produce the film under his production company Red Chillies Entertainment, Talking about the initiative, the director said:\"we were both passionate about the subject, we said why not co-produce the film? We've known each other so long ... that this new initiative is just an extension of our emotions. Besides, I can never make a film without Shah Rukh.\" My Name Is Khan debuted in Abu Dhabi, UAE on 10 February 2010. It released globally in cinemas on 12 February 2010. MNIK had a two phase release. To begin with, it had a mainstream release in India coupled with a regular Diaspora release in UK, US, Gulf, Australia and various other countries. \"After that in the months of April and May, we would be looking at a mainstream theatrical release in countries like Germany, Poland and other parts of North America,\" detailed Johar. My Name Is Khan was screened as part of 60th Berlin International Film Festival's Official Selection in February 2010, out of competition. The website eBay auctioned the tickets for the film's screening at the Berlin Film Festival for a record price of \u00a31.000 (INR60.000) each. All the tickets were sold out in five seconds. The first look of My Name Is Khan unveiled at a grand function at Mumbai by Johar, Khan and Kajol and was then be beamed across 70 countries worldwide on the Star TV Network. Says Karan, \"This is a first in the history of Bollywood \u2013 that the promos of a film will play across such a wide platform. And, this has mainly been made possible because of our synergy with Fox Star Studios...and also the first time a Bollywood company is tying up with a mainstream Hollywood studio. So, there are many firsts to this venture.\" The trailer of the film was released at the premiere of the Hollywood film, Avatar. My Name Is Khan marked the first instance of a film using the Roadblock advertising technique to market a film, in which the three-minute trailer was aired on all leading television channels simultaneously. \"I will add that MNIK is a very special topic about humanity in the garb of a Muslim character [...] The film is made on a large canvas and the subject material is adapted in terms of humanity in a very entertaining way [...] the message of love, the way it has been shot internationally and the way of releasing it, might have all the possibilities of an international release. It is going to be released in a way no Hindi film has been released internationally before\" The makers of the film made various brand tie-ups to for the promotion of the film. Dish TV entered into a strategic marketing alliance with Fox Star and spend approximately Rs4 crore in a month-long 360 degree integrated marketing campaign which ran across all India to co-promote the brand and the movie. Reebok created an entire MNIK footwear and apparel collection to promote the film. On 1 February 2010, Khan and Kajol became the first Indian movie stars to ring the opening bell of the New York stock exchange NASDAQ. They were invited by Fox Searchlight Pictures to do so as part of their promotion for My Name Is Khan. Shahrukh Khan also appeared on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross as part of its promotion in the UK, becoming only the second Indian after Shilpa Shetty to do so. On 7 August 2009, Karan Johar signed a deal for INR 1\u00a0billion with Fox Searchlight Pictures, who will market and distribute it in India (FOXSTAR) and worldwide (Fox Searchlight). It covers all rights except music, which has been secured by Sony Music. Subhash K. Jha (film critic and author of The Essential Guide to Bollywood) gave My Name Is Khan a rave review arguing that Rizwan Khan \"repairs almost anything, including irreparably damaged relationships. But this film about damaged lives needs no repairing. My Name Is Khan is a flawless work, as perfect in content, tone and treatment as any film can get [...] My Name Is Khan is no ordinary film. Long after the wary-of-physical-touch Rizwan has finally shaken hands with President Obama, long after the heat and dust of racial and communal hatred has settled down the core of humanism that the film secretes stays with you. Yes, we finally know what they mean by a feelgood film.\" Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India also gave it five stars, describing My Name Is Khan as, \"indubitably one of the most meaningful and moving films to be rolled out from the Bollywood mills in recent times.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave My Name Is Khan four and a half out of five stars and argues, \"When a film stars two of the finest talents of the country, you expect nothing but the best. SRK, well, how does one describe his performance? To state that this is his best work so far would be cutting short the praise he truly deserves [...] Kajol is pure dynamite and casting her for this character was the most appropriate decision. No other actress could've matched SRK in histrionics the way Kajol has. In fact, SRK and Kajol complement each other wonderfully well and this film only proves it yet again. It's a powerhouse performance from this supremely talented actress.\" Sarita Tanwar of Mid-Day gave the film four and a half out of five stars and described it as \"near-perfect\", concluding that \"The Karan-Shah Rukh-Kajol combo strikes once more.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave My Name Is Khan three and a half out of five stars, arguing that \"the film shamelessly tugs at your heartstrings and on more than one occasion wallops you to weep. Aided by solid camerawork, tight editing and a layered story, Johar crafts an engaging, stirring saga that is earnest and noble. With this message movie in the mainstream format, the director takes a step in the right direction.\" Sudhish Kamath from The Hindu wrote, \"My Name Is Khan is populist, yet layered with rich political subtext. It's all about types, yet every character feels real. It's about generalisations and yet it chooses to dwell on the specifics. It's all heart and spirit that you can't help but overlook the flaws and admire it.\" According to BBC critic Manish Gajjar, who gave the film four out of five stars, the film is \"a fiction-based film refreshingly told with realism of racial profiling on American soil. It's a rare treat for Hindi commercial cinema and a crossover audience.\" Pratim D. Gupta from The Telegraph in a positive review concluded, \"My Name Is Khan has conscience and courage and two heartfelt performances. It can try your patience a bit but it will not leave you untouched.\" Namrata Joshi from Outlook, giving the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, described it as \"a gentle, affecting and heart-warming film that makes you smile through your tears. It looks at contentious issues but offers overwhelming hope and renewal.\" Rotten Tomatoes lists an approval rating of 81%, with 18 positive and 4 negative reviews. As of 21 February 2010, the film has a score of 50 out of a scale of 100 on the review aggregate website Metacritic, based on 7 reviews. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times states, \"Khan is one of a handful of Hindi films (New York, Kurbaan) about Indians living in a paranoid, post-9/11 America, and there's something fascinating about looking at this country through a Bollywood lens, even when the story is a kind of fairy tale. (Most interesting here is the link made between black Americans and Indians, especially Muslims.) Skilfully directed by Karan Johar and with an evocative score by Shankar, Ehsaan & Loy, Khan jerks tears with ease, while teaching lessons about Islam and tolerance.\" According to Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter, My Name Is Khan is, \"a film that delves compellingly into Americans' anti-Muslim hysteria\" as it tackles \"a subject American movies have mostly avoided \u2013 that of racial profiling and the plight of Muslim-Americans. It also allows Shah Rukh Khan to display his talent to an even wider audience. It's well worth the 162-minute journey.\" Jay Wesissberg of Variety describes My Name Is Khan as a \"riotously overstuffed and enormously enjoyable drama\" with \"confident camerawork [which] is matched by exceptional production design\" He also states that Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol are a \"delight together and her natural warmth makes the relationship even more believable.\" My Name Is Khan was not India's official entry to the Oscars as best foreign language film, but it made it to the reminder list of films eligible for the 83rd Academy Awards. My Name Is Khan opened very well in most places across the world, and set many records in the process.However, the performance of the film could not sustain beyond the first or second week in some places, including India and USA. The film's performance in India was quite good but still is generally regarded as \"below expectations\" due to the high price, while the overseas performance of the film has been record breaking. As of 4 April, the worldwide gross revenue for My Name Is Khan from the box office is US$36,145,870. Domestically, My Name Is Khan generated INR 727\u00a0million net (equating to INR 967\u00a0million gross).

The film also broke the record for a Bollywood release in the first quarter of the year, breaking the previous two-year record held by Race. In the UK, the film broke the four-year record of Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, and became the highest-grossing Bollywood film in the UK. In the Middle East it is also the highest grossing Bollywood film. As of date My Name Is Khan is the second highest-grossing film in overseas markets, next to 3 Idiots which was released in newer markets in China in December 2011. The film faced considerable falls in collections after its first week. The drops in collections is evident from the fact that 63% of the film's net collections came from the first week, as compared to 54% for Race, 56% for Ghajini, 49% for Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi and 39% for 3 Idiots. In spite of this, the film managed to retain the No. 1 position at the box office for two consecutive weeks. It was in the top 5 list of the Indian box office for six consecutive weeks. Though the mid-week collections saw a drop of 60% from the opening weekend, it held up well against other major releases and secured the highest first quarter collections, a record previously held by the 2008 film Race. Thus, the film is a financial success owing to its record-breaking overseas collections and healthy domestic collections. The music was released on 5 January 2010, by Sony Music Entertainment (India) who has also previously released the music for Karan Johar's movies Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...(2001) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, which gained global musical success. The musical soundtrack consists of 6 original songs and 4 bonus tracks that are taken from Karan Johar's previous successful films that have featured Shahrukh Khan. The soundtrack includes one instrumental called \"Khan Theme\", composed by Indrajit Sharma and the strings for the song are performed by the Bombay Film Orchestra. The songs such as \"Noor-e-Khuda\" blend western bar blues and techno sounds with Indian classical styles such as Sufi and Hindustani. The song \"Allah hi Rahem\" sung by Ustad Rashid Khan is another example of Sufi thematic song. The soundtrack is thus representative of the \"indie fusion genre\". Unlike Karan Johar's other films, this film has no lip-sync songs. All the songs are in background. Upon its release, the album received generally positive reviews from most music critics. Gianysh Toolsee of Planet Bollywood states that the soundtrack is \"very much about transcending the boundaries set by Bollywood by venturing into an emotional state through Sufism and spirituality.\"Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gives the album a three out of five stars, suggests that director Karan Johar along with musicians Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and lyricist Niranjan Iyengar \"have brought not a partial but a substantial difference to the way music in [Johar's] films is being looked at.\" Although Niranjan Iyengar is alone credited for writing the lyrics for the songs, Niranjan penned the only two Sufi songs in the film, \"Sajda\" and \"Allah Hi Rahem\". The famous lyricist, Javed Akhtar was approached to write the lyrics for the remaining three songs. Earlier it was reported that he refused to write lyrics, because Javed Akhtar did not want to share the credits with another lyricist since Niranjan Iyengar has written two songs for the film. Later Karan Johar confirmed that Javed Akhtar penned the remaining songs, but Javed did not want him to be credited as the lyricist when the soundtrack released as he had to share the credits with Nirinjan Iyenger. Javed confirmed this and said, \"I don't like to share the credits. I would have got the publicity but the other person, who has done a fine job, wouldn't have. I have read the songs penned by Niranjan and I think he has done a great job.\" Khan has stated that due to his last name and religion, he (like Rizwan Khan) is frequently subject to excess security checks at airports. On 14 August 2009, Khan arrived in the United States to promote My Name Is Khan and to participate in South Asian-related events around the country (including Indian Independence Day). Upon arriving at Newark Airport in New Jersey, he was pulled aside by immigration officers after his name popped up on their computers, questioned for over an hour (Khan claims it was at least two hours) about the nature of his visit, and was later released. According to the Times Online, \"In Delhi, Timothy J. Roemer, the American Ambassador to India, said that the embassy was trying to 'ascertain the facts of the case.' He added: 'Shah Rukh Khan, the actor and global icon, is a welcome guest in the United States.'\" Khan said he was told that it was because \"they said my name was common to some name that popped up on the computer.\" The officials asked if he could provide names of people to vouch for him. Khan noted that he \"had all the documents; they were asking me where I was going to be staying. I gave the name of FOX people with whom I had finalised a deal a few days ago as contacts.\" However, because they wanted to check his luggage which the airline had lost, Khan said that he \"was taken to a room where many people were awaiting a secondary check on visa, most were South Asians. In fact many officers were reluctantly vouching for me, some people were asking for autographs and a Pakistani fan even said he knew who I was. But the officers said it was procedure and kept taking numbers from me.\" \"I did feel bad for a lot of people in that room, I know because I had an escort and someone would recognise me, I will get out. Others may face more trouble [...] I have extra security because of my name. I can handle this but when you have someone as respectable as an ex-president getting frisked, I am nobody (in reference to the frisking of President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam earlier in the summer).[...] I think it is a procedure that needs to be followed. But it is an unfortunate procedure.\" While he was not allowed to use his own phone, Khan was permitted one phone call. He was thus released after officials from the Indian Consulate intervened. Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel stated that the event will be further explored with U.S. officials. According to the BBC, \"Elmer Camacho, a spokesman for the US Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, said the questioning was part of the agency's routine process to screen foreign travellers.\" When asked if he would demand an apology, Khan replied that he would not. The director of My Name Is Khan, Karan Johar, was asked during an August 2009 interview with MiD DAY if the event was a publicity stunt for the film. Johar denied that it was and responded: \"It's upsetting because I got a text message this morning asking me if it was publicity plug for my movie. (Sarcastically) I mean, if I had that much power over the Homeland Security, why would I allow Shah Rukh to go through something like this? [...] What's really shocking is the fact that when I was writing the film, I never thought that what happened to the protagonist of the film would happen to Shah Rukh.\" During a January 2010 interview, Khan referred to the implication that the event was a publicity stunt for the film as \"lowdown and cheap.\" Christopher B. Duncan, who portrays President Obama in My Name Is Khan, also commented on the incident stating: \"I was very disappointed with what SRK experienced at the airport. We're living in times where the levels of fear can sometimes spill over into paranoia. Here's a man who is an international superstar, being detained for an excessive amount of time at an airport in the United States. It had to be very upsetting for him. Imagine Oprah (Winfrey) being detained at an airport in India for a long time, during a kind of interrogation.\" In addition, the incident sparked debate and commentary among Indian politicians, actors, and others. It also led to demonstrations in India. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger later invited Khan to have dinner with him \"in a bid to diffuse what has become a slight diplomatic row.\" In another event, on 5 February 2010, while promoting My Name Is Khan on the British talk show Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Khan claimed that female security staff at Heathrow Airport in London had printed a naked image of him taken using the newly installed body scanner that he was asked to go through. He said that he autographed it for them, though it is not clear if his comments were intended as a joke. A BAA spokeswoman for Heathrow Airport has denied his claim. She claimed that it was \"completely factually incorrect\", stressing that images captured using the equipment could not be stored or distributed in any form and that his claims \"simply could not be true.\" In relation to Khan's comments, The Economic Times has raised concerns over the new body scanners and the possibilities of it being abused to distribute naked pictures of celebrities. His comments have restarted the debate in Britain over whether the new scanners violate individual privacy. After Shahrukh Khan (who owns the Kolkata Knight Riders cricket team) criticised the fact that members of the Pakistani Cricket Team were not bought by the clubs competing in the 2010 Indian Premier League (IPL), he was condemned by Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist political party. There were consequent protests and demonstrations against him and demands that cinemas in India refuse to screen My Name Is Khan. Khan responded by stating, \"What did I say that was wrong? All I said was that I wanted people to come to my country.\" Khan continued by stating that: \"I have no idea what I am supposed to apologise for [...] If I am in wrong I would like to apologise but someone needs to explain to me what is wrong.\" He also stated that he does \"not want any confrontation. I am trying to explain myself on every platform [...] I have not said anything that is anti-national.\" Khan said that he was willing to meet with Bal Thackeray to discuss the issue. Initially, Shiv Sena rescinded its demand to block release of My Name Is Khan after it was announced that Khan would be allowed to release it \"in as many theatres\" as he would like. However, on 10 January 2010, when cinemas opened for advanced bookings, individuals disguised as \"cinegoers\" began to attack cinemas and booking centres. Director Karan Johar and distributors met with police to ask for additional security. In response, Chief Minister of Maharashtra Ashok Chavan threatened to withdraw security cover for party leader Uddhav Thackeray. Later, some security was withdrawn and the Maharashtra government has \"called in five battalions of the State Reserve Police Force to protect 63 cinemas in the city that will screen the film directed by Karan Johar from this Friday.\" There were multiple arrests and leave of all police officials were cancelled. The distributor, Fox Star, stated that the film would still be released on its scheduled opening date, 12 February. It opened to full cinema houses across India.",

        "full_text": " Namastey London (English: Greetings London) is a 2007 Indian drama film directed by Vipul Amrutlal Shah, starring Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif. It also stars Rishi Kapoor, Javed Sheikh, Upen Patel and Clive Standen in supporting roles. The movie is originally based on a true life story of Akshay Kumar's friend. Riteish Deshmukh has a cameo role in the film. Critics have noted similarities between the film and the 1970 Manoj Kumar-directed Purab Aur Paschim, though the director denied it being a remake. The film became a box-office success upon release and also earned Kumar a Filmfare Award for Best Actor nomination.   Indian-born Manmohan Malhotra (Rishi Kapoor) re-located to London, England, established himself, returned to India, got married to Bebo (Nina Wadia), and after four years got a visa for her so that she could live with him. Shortly thereafter, she gave birth to Jasmeet (Katrina Kaif). Manmohan was always embarrassed by Bebo as she was fat and could not speak English. As a result, he always left her out of important occasions, while he socialised. Bebo did not want Jasmeet to end up like her, so she got her educated in an English school, encouraged to mingle with British friends, and Jasmeet was transformed into Jazz \u2013 a beautiful young woman, modern in looks, talk, habits, and heart. Her father had set her to meet a young lad, Bobby Bedi (Ritesh Deshmukh), though the date turns out to be a disaster and Bobby rejects her. Manmohan thinks that it is impossible to get him an Indian son-in-law, although his friend, Parvez Khan (Javed Sheikh), is in a similar situation with his son, Imran (Upen Patel), who has a blonde girlfriend, Susan (Tiffany Mulheron). Manmohan takes his family for a tour in India and forces Jasmeet to marry Arjun Singh (Akshay Kumar) who does not know how to speak English. On their return to London, Jasmeet announces that she is getting married to Charlie Brown (Clive Standen), who is well educated and has good friends and connections, even with Prince Charles. She refuses to recognise her marriage with Arjun as there is no proof of the wedding. When Jasmeet is introduced to the friends of the Brown family, she is subjected to considerable racist abuse (snake charmers, Indian rope tricks, tandoori chicken) as well as a quote from Winston Churchill: 'When we leave India, the country will be in the hands of goons'.Arjun then tells the gentleman about the achievements of India which includes about the derivation of English words from Sanskrit like 'Father' , 'Brother' , 'Trignometry' and 'Geometry'. During this period, Jazz becomes close with Arjun who still supports her. Charlie Brown then has a rugby match against the Indians and Arjun, the English lose and Brown is verbally racist to the Indians. Imran is then asked by Susan's parents to leave Islam, become a Christian, change his name to Emmanuel or Ian, as well as provide written proof that his family is not associated with terrorists. The film ends on a happy note when Imran decides not to be a Christian and Susan is accepted by Imran's family; Jazz realises her love for Arjun, runs away from her wedding to Charlie Brown, and goes with Arjun back to India where they are seen riding Arjun's motorcycle. While they are on the motorcycle Arjun reveals that all along he knew how to speak English. Priyanka Chopra was the original choice for the role of Jasmeet Malhotra Singh (Jazz). However, Salman Khan forced the director to replace her with his then girlfriend Katrina Kaif. The reviews of the film were generally positive. Taran Adarsh of indiafm.com wrote, \"Namastey London is addictive stuff. You watch it once, you wanna watch it again.\" Akshay Kumar received almost unanimous praise for his portrayal of Arjun Singh, with a critic saying \"Kumar certainly leaves his mark throughout the flick. One of the coolest performances of the star.\" Adarsh said \"One of his finest performances so far, Namastey London also marks the coming of age of an actor who was often dubbed as an action hero or a funster. Akshay not only wins the heart of Katrina on screen, he's sure to win the hearts of millions of moviegoers with a terrific portrayal in this film.\" On Katrina Kaif's performance he wrote, \"she handles the complex part with remarkable ease. The pretty lass is only getting better with every film.\" Despite the generally favourable reviews, Prachi Singh of Moviewalah panned the film, with a verdict of 2 out of 5 stars. Namastey London opened to a good response and mainly picked up momentum after the second and third day of its release, a major reason being India's exit out of the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The film did extremely well in the northern parts of India especially in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. It also did well in Mumbai and in the first week of its release collected \u20b973,575,657. The film was received very well in other parts of the country. The success of the film ended a long spell of box office failures since the release of Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love in January 2007. The film went on to gross \u20b9714,102,500 worldwide, making it one of the top hits of 2007. The film was also successful overseas. It debuted at number 9 on the UK charts and similarly debuted within the top 20 in the United States and Australian charts. The film collected \u00a3238,841 in the first week of its release. As of 27 July 2007, the movie grossed an estimated $15,273,747 in five territories which included the United States ($4,149,772), Australia ($197,148), India ($17,267,662), Malaysia ($15,285), and the United Kingdom ($9,021,900). The soundtrack album was released on 27 January 2007 and received good reviews. The songs were composed by Himesh Reshammiya. Salim-Sulaiman composed the film score. The song \"Chakna Chakna\" and its remix version were penned by Sameer, all other songs were penned by Javed Akhtar. The film was unofficially remade in Bengali, as Paran Jai Jaliya Re starring Dev and Subhashree Ganguly. The Kolkata High Court in December 2009 banned the screening of the film for plagiarism after a petition was filed by the film's producers. In March 2011, Shah announced his intention to make a sequel, Namastey England. Kumar and Sonakshi Sinha have been signed to play the leads in the sequel, which will shoot scenes in London, Punjab, Mumbai, Germany, and Switzerland. The film's plot has not been fully revealed, but it will not be a direct continuation of the first film.",

The film was later remade in Tamil as Sandhippu (1983) with Sivaji Ganesan and Prabhu Ganesan and in Telugu as Trimurtulu (1987) with Daggubati Venkatesh.   Naseeb, a story of destiny and fate, begins with a lottery ticket. A drunken man who cannot pay his tab trades: so he decides to sell his ticket to the waiter, Namdev (Pran), instead. Namdev purchases this tickt with his three friends Damu (Amjad Khan), Raghu (Kader Khan) and Jaggi (Jagdish Raj). Using a system of drawing out the highest card to decide who keeps the ticket, Jaggi wins, and the ticket stays with him. When the ticket turns out to be a winner, Damu and Raghu turn on the other two, murdering Jaggi and framing Namdev. Namdev goes on the run but Raghu and Damu intervene and throw him over a bridge into a river and Namdev is presumed dead. However, he is rescued by a don (Amrish Puri), and no one is aware he is alive. Fast forward to twenty years later \u2014 Damu and Raghu have used their stolen lottery money to build a fabulous hotel and make millions becoming very successful businessmen. Damu has used a share of his money to send his youngest son, Vicky (Shatrughan Sinha), to school in England. They have even employed Namdev's oldest son Johnny (Amitabh Bachchan), Vicky's best friend, as a waiter in the hotel. By coincidence (or by fate!) Johnny and Vicky fall in love with the same beautiful singer, Miss Asha (Hema Malini). Julie (Reena Roy) is a childhood friend of Vicky's who is in love with him, but he only sees her as a friend. When Johnny discovers this, he and Julie sacrifice their own love to ensure that Vicky and Asha get together. At the same time, Johny's younger brother Sunny (Rishi Kapoor) has fallen for Asha's younger sister, Kim (Kim). Kim and Asha happen to be the daughters of Jaggi, the man Namdev supposedly murdered. Namdev returns soon after and plans to take revenge against Damu and Raghu for separating him from his sons Johnny and Sunny.

Originally filmed in black and white, the film was colourized and re-released on 3 August 2007. The film was later dubbed in Tamil as Pattalyin Sabatham (Tamil: \u0baa\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0baa\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bcd) in 1958.   The film is set in post-independence India, where industrialization is slowly creeping in. The focus is on tongawallahs who earn their living transporting people on tongas (horse carts). Their livelihood is threatened when the son of a rich landlord (Jeevan) begins operating a bus service in the town, which he subsidizes heavily with the sole intention of first driving the tongawallahs out of the town and then making profits. Dilip Kumar plays one of the tongawallahs, who petitions the landlord over this injustice. Jeevan's character proposes a competition to decide which service is the best: The bus or the Tonga? It is decided that there will be a race between the vehicles. If the bus wins, the tongawallahs will not complain further. If the Tonga wins, the bus service will stop. This competition was a farce from the start since nobody could dream that a horse cart could beat a machine. Kumar, however, accepts the challenge to everybody's surprise. His logic is that they would be driven to starvation if the bus service continues. This race at least gives them an opportunity to try to do something. The rest of the tongawallahs do not share his hope. They blame him for his foolishness. In the end, he is left alone with nobody's support except his sweetheart, played by Vyjayanthimala. As the movie unfolds, a hopeless situation begins to turn around because of the way the people come together. Mishap after mishap occurs, but nothing can deter the determined. The highlight of the film is definitely the heart-stopping final race where the underdog wins. During filming, the Naya Daur production was involved in a highly controversial and widely publicized court case. Initially the actress Madhubala was cast as the female lead. An advance payment was given to her and shooting began and continued smoothly for 15 days. B.R. Chopra, the director, wanted the unit to travel to Bhopal for an extended outdoor shooting. Ataullah Khan, the father of Madhubala, objected to this and claimed that the entire Bhopal schedule was a ruse to give Dilip Kumar the opportunity to romance his daughter (Kumar and Madhubala were in a relationship at the time). Finally, Chopra sued Madhubala for the cash advance she received from him for a film she now had no intention of completing. He replaced her with the South Indian actress Vyjayanthimala who acted with Kumar in Devdas. Madhubala obediently supported her father despite her commitment to Dilip Kumar. Kumar testified against Madhubala and Ataullah Khan in favor of the director B.R. Chopra in open court. The case was lost by Madhubala and her father amid much negative publicity. During the case, the film was released and declared a success. Chopra dropped the case and saved Madhubala from the humiliation of a possible prison sentence. By the end of its theatrical run, Naya Daur collected around \u20b9 5,40,00,000 thus becoming the second highest grossing film of 1957 behind the critically acclaimed Mother India. All the songs in Hindi were composed by O P Nayyar and lyrics were penned by Sahir Ludhianvi. Playback singers are Mohammed Rafi, Balbir, Asha Bhosle & Shamshad Begum.  All the songs in Tamil were composed by O P Nayyar and lyrics were penned by Kambadasan. Playback singers are T. M. Soundararajan, Seerkazhi Govindarajan, P. Suseela & T. V. Rathinam.

Part of the story is loosely adapted from the 2007 Manoj-Babli honour killing case. The film's title refers to the 403\u00a0km long National Highway 10 in India. NH10 released theatrically on 13 March 2015. The film and Sharma's performance garnered critical acclaim, and the film emerged as a sleeper hit. Some critics consider it the most violent Hindi-language movie in the 2010s. Sharma gained a nomination in 2016 Filmfare for Best Actress.   A couple, Meera (Anushka Sharma) and Arjun (Neil Bhoopalam), are enjoying a party, where Meera gets an urgent work call from her office. On the way, she is attacked by some street punks who smash her car's window. Meera manages to escape but is shaken by the incident. Arjun suggests a road trip for Meera's upcoming birthday. The couple starts their journey the next day. While stopping at a roadside dhaba for lunch, a petrified young girl Pinky (Tanya Purohit Dobhal) arrives and pleads for help, saying a few men are about to kill her. Meera shakes her off but they see a gang of men round up the same girl and a boy, beat them savagely and drag them to an SUV. Arjun intervenes but Satbir (Darshan Kumar), the gang leader slaps Arjun and asks him to keep off by saying that the girl is his own sister. As the horrified couple watches, the gang drives off in the SUV. Despite Meera's pleadings, Arjun feels compelled to act and drives after the gang since he cannot digest the casual cruelty he saw. On a deserted area off the National Highway, the couple witnesses a brutal honor killing of the young boy and the girl Pinky. Terrified, Arjun and Meera attempt to flee but the gang finds them. As the gang digs the boy's grave, Satbir shoots Pinky. A fight ensues and Arjun shoots Chhotey (Ravi Beniwal), one of the gang members. The gang is enraged and the couple run for their lives. At night, the couple finds themselves face to face with one of the gang members. As Arjun gets injured by one of the gang members, Meera shoots him dead. They make it to a railway bridge, where Meera tells Arjun to wait till she gets help. She finds a police station where she asks a policeman to help as they have witnessed an honor killing \u2013 at the mention of that term, the cop throws Meera out of the station. On the way, a Police Inspector (Sushil Tyagi) meets her in his Maruti Gypsy and on her request, he starts driving back to where Arjun is lying injured. By his talks and behaviour, Meera realizes that the Police Inspector is also in collusion with her attackers. She manages to stab him in his eyes, killing him and drives off the Gypsy, with the gang chasing her in their SUV. As they find her overturned Gypsy, Meera stumbles off and finds a labourer's hut. The labourer and his wife protect her from the gang member Fauji (Ravi Jhankal) who comes asking about her and advise her to go to the chief (Sarpanch) of the nearby village. Meera reaches the village's Chief Ammaji (Deepti Naval), to whom she tells her story. Ammaji's mood changes the moment she hears of the honor killing and a puzzled Meera looks around to see a pillow cover on Ammaji's lap with the word 'Pinky' stitched on it and a photograph of the dead girl in the room. Ammaji rapidly locks her in the room and calls the gang. As they arrive Ammaji criticizes them for a shabby job and hands Meera over to them. They drag her out and beat her in the courtyard in order to kill her. However, she manages to escape with their SUV and rushes to the railway bridge to find that Arjun has been murdered brutally by the gang. Meera shrieks in grief and rage and returns to the village to avenge Arjun's death, where she drives the SUV ruthlessly into two gang members, killing them instantly.

        "full_text": " No Entry is a Hindi comedy film released in 2005. It was directed by Anees Bazmee and produced by Boney Kapoor. The film features an ensemble cast of Anil Kapoor, Salman Khan, Bipasha Basu, Fardeen Khan, Lara Dutta, Esha Deol and Celina Jaitley with a cameo appearance by Sameera Reddy. A remake of the Tamil super hit Charlie Chaplin, No Entry was Bollywood's biggest hit of 2005.   Kishen (Anil Kapoor) has a suspicious-minded wife, Kaajal (Lara Dutta), who thinks he is always having an affair with another woman, even though he is extremely faithful to her and wouldn't dream of betraying her in any way. Prem (Salman Khan) has the opposite situation. He is married to Pooja (Esha Deol), who is very trusting, even though he has been having several affairs with numerous gorgeous women. There is also Kishen's friend Shekhar (Fardeen Khan), who accidentally falls in love with Sanjana (Celina Jaitley) and marries her. Then Bobby (Bipasha Basu), a call girl, enters the story. When Kishen takes pictures of Prem and his girlfriend, and threatens to send them to his wife, Prem hires Bobby to seduce Kishen. The plan is that Kishen will fall in love with her, and Prem wants to see if Kishen can hide the relationship. Then the lies start happening, as Kaajal thinks Bobby is Shekhar's wife, and Sanjana thinks Bobby is Kishen's wife. It becomes a bundle of confusion, arguments and comedy when all the various couples meet together. The truth is eventually told through many comedic encounters, and eventually the 3 friends seemingly turn over a new leaf. It is hinted at the end of the movie, however, that the three friends have not completely turned over a new leaf with the entrance of Sameera Reddy in a cameo. During the production of No Entry, speculations arose that it would be a remake of the film Masti (2004). The comparisons were made due to both films revolving around the same subject of extra-marital affairs. However, producer Boney Kapoor strongly denied the similarities and clarified that No Entry will be a remake of the Tamil film titled Charlie Chaplin (2002). Kapoor also stressed that he will never endorse innuendo-based films such as Masti. The film gained a lot of popularity and was the biggest blockbuster of 2005. It was a big success, grossing \u20b9119 crore worldwide. It was declared as an \"Blockbuster\" by \"ibosnetwork\" The music of the film has been composed by Anu Malik. Lyrics were written by Sameer. A sequel to the movie called No Entry Mein Entry is in the works, with the original male cast of Salman Khan, Anil Kapoor and Fardeen Khan all rumoured to be playing double roles.

        "full_text": " No One Killed Jessica is a 2011 Indian biographical thriller film starring Rani Mukerji and Vidya Balan, produced by UTV Spotboy and directed by Rajkumar Gupta. This film is based on the Jessica Lal murder case. The score was composed by Amit Trivedi, who worked on the soundtrack for Dev D (2009). The character of Jessica\u2019s older sister, Sabrina Lal, is played by Vidya Balan, and the character of the news reporter following the story is played by Rani Mukerji. Upon release, the film garnered positive critical reviews and enjoyed a successful outing at the box office. No One Killed Jessica received four nominations at the 57th Filmfare Awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Film and the Filmfare Award for Best Actress; it won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for Rani Mukerji's performance.   The film, set in New Delhi, was inspired by the true story of the controversial Jessica Lal murder case. The director explained that the title was inspired by a 2006 headline of a news story that ran when the accused killer in an infamous murder case was acquitted by a trial court. The events and the subsequent media coverage sparked nationwide protests, resulting in an appeal and re-opening of the murder case and the subsequent sentencing of the killer. No One Killed Jessica is based on the true story of Jessica Lal, a Delhi-based model and restaurant worker who was shot in 1999 at a New Delhi restaurant by Siddharth Vashisht, better known as Manu Sharma. The killer was the son of the wealthy, influential, and intimidating Haryana politician, Venod Sharma, a close aide of the chief minister of Haryana, Bhupinder Singh Hooda. Jessica, along with actor and model Shayan Munshi, were closing the bar at the restaurant where they worked. They were approached by Manu and his two friends. Infuriated by Jessica's refusal to serve them drinks after the bar closed, Manu fatally shot Jessica. The subsequent investigation and trial were stymied by Manu's family, who did not hesitate to use their political, financial, and law enforcement connections to intimidate, coerce, and bribe the majority of the witnesses to the crime. The case then became an uneven battle between Jessica\u2019s family (especially her sister Sabrina) and Manu's high-powered family and their associates in the local government. In February 2006, the court acquitted Manu and his friends, citing a lack of sufficient evidence. This set off a public outcry and widespread protests, which as depicted in the movie, were led by Prabhloch Singh, the founder of an organization called the \"Middle Finger Protests\" from Manu Sharma's hometown Chandigarh. The backlash forced the re-opening of the investigation, which was placed on a judicial fast track. In December 2006, Manu was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. The film was released on 7 January 2011. It received positive reviews from critics and was also well received by the viewing public. No One Killed Jessica recovered its cost even before release through associated satellite and music rights. No One Killed Jessica received mostly positive reviews from critics. Nikhat Kazmi of the Times of India gave four out of five stars, stating, \"No One Killed Jessica is a film that unleashes a myriad emotions in you. The hard facts of modern India's most written about case are well known by almost everybody but the director Rajkumar Gupta's (he'd already displayed his talent in Aamir) dramatic handling of the crime, the criminals, the crusaders and the victim creates a storm, once again.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama also gave four out of five stars, describing it as \"a remarkable blend of facts and fiction inspired by a series of real-life episodes, which has thankfully not been presented as a tedious biography or in a mind-numbing docu-drama format.\" Anupama Chopra of NDTV gave the film three out of five starts, writing: \"No One Killed Jessica is several notches ahead of the tripe we\u2019ve been subjected to in theatres lately.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it two and a half out of five stars and wrote, \"With the exception of a few powerful scenes that leave you with a genuine lump in your throat, Gupta goes for full-on melodrama that doesn't always ring true.\" Mayank Shekhar of the Hindustan Times gave it three out of five stars, noting: \"Can a feature film, in a couple of hours flat, ever detail an entire truth about anything? Possibly not. But it can entertainingly dramatise it. That\u2019s what the fine director-writer and a consummate raconteur here (Rajkumar Gupta) manages to do.\" Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan described No One Killed Jessica as a \"pertinent, media friendly and brave effort by the makers. The performances living up to the title and story of the film.\" The film's score was composed by Amit Trivedi, who also worked with Gupta on Aamir. The lyrics were written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. The album received generally positive reviews from critics. During the filming of scenes in Delhi, the building for the University School of Information Technology, one of the 12 on-campus schools of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, had its facade dressed up to look like the Patiala House District Court. In the middle of filming, the university's vice chancellor, Dilip Bandopadhyay, was prevented from entering his own campus. Bandopadhyay argued with bouncers, on guard outside the main gate, to let him enter while the cameras rolled, allegedly without his permission. As a result, the university terminated the contract of a faculty member accused of organising the film shoot on campus.",

        "full_text": " Omkara is a 2006 Indian crime drama film adapted from Shakespeare\u2019s Othello, co-written and directed by Vishal Bhardwaj. It starred Ajay Devgan, Saif Ali Khan, Vivek Oberoi and Kareena Kapoor in the lead roles, supported by Naseeruddin Shah, Konkona Sen Sharma and Bipasha Basu. The director Vishal Bhardwaj himself composed the entire music for the film, including the background score, with lyrics by Gulzar. The film is set in Meerut, a town in Western Uttar Pradesh. The film was showcased in the March\u00e9 du Film section at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival along with a book on the making of Omkara. It was also selected to be screened at the Cairo International Film Festival, where Bhardwaj was awarded for Best Artistic Contribution in Cinema of a Director. The film also won three awards at the Kara Film Festival, an award at the Asian Festival of First Films, three National Film Awards, and seven Filmfare Awards. The film became part of a series by Bhardwaj of film interpretations of popular literary works, including Maqbool (2003) based on Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth, The Blue Umbrella (2007) based on Ruskin Bond's The Blue Umbrella, 7 Khoon Maaf (2011) based on Bond's Susanna's Seven Husbands, and Haider (2014) based on Shakspeare's Hamlet.   Omkara Shukla or Omi (Ajay Devgan) is a bahubali, a sort of political enforcer. He is the leader of a gang which commits political crimes for the local politician Tiwari Bhaisaab (Naseeruddin Shah). Ishwar 'Langda' Tyagi (Saif Ali Khan) and Keshav 'Kesu Firangi' Upadhyay (Vivek Oberoi) are his closest lieutenants. The movie starts with Langda Tyagi gate-crashing a baraat and challenging Rajju (Deepak Dobriyal), the bridegroom, to try and stop Omkara from abducting the bride, Dolly Mishra (Kareena Kapoor). Rajju fails and the wedding never takes place. Dolly\u2019s father Advocate Raghunath Mishra (Kamal Tiwari), mostly referred in the movie as vakeel saab (lawyer sir), is furious and confronts Omi. He puts a gun to Omi\u2019s head and demands the return of his daughter. Bhaisaab intervenes and resolves the conflict by mentioning the current political conditions and prevents bloodshed. Still unconvinced, Raghunath grieves to Bhaisaab the next day. To bring an end to this issue, Dolly is made to appear in front of her father and clarify that she eloped with Omi and was not abducted. She also tells the events of how she fell in love with Omkara. The father leaves feeling betrayed and ashamed. The director here references one of the most significant lines of the play Othello, with Dolly's father repeating the couplet almost verbatim, albeit in translation. The original lines read, \"Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see. She has deceived her father and may thee.\" After some crafty political arm-twisting, involving an MMS sex scandal, Omkara eliminates a powerful electoral rival. Bhaisaab is elected for parliament and Omkara is promoted from bahubali to the candidate for the upcoming state elections. Omkara appoints Kesu over Langda as his successor once he enters politics himself. Langda, disappointed with Omkara's poor judgment and jealous of Kesu, his younger, less-experienced, superior, hatches a plot to avenge both his offenders. He first causes a violent brawl between Kesu and Rajju by taking advantage of Kesu's low threshold for alcohol. Such irresponsible behaviour by Kesu infuriates Omi, who now starts having doubts over his decision. On the one hand, playing the role of a concerned friend, Langda convinces Kesu to appeal to Dolly, Omi's lover and newly wedded wife, to mollify Omi. On the other hand, he starts to disrepute Dolly by implicating Kesu's visits to her as an illicit affair between the two. A kamarbandh carelessly dropped by Dolly and stolen by Langda\u2019s wife Indu (Konkona Sen Sharma), which eventually reaches Billo Chamanbahar (Bipasha Basu) as a gift from Kesu, plays an important part in the plot, as evidence of Dolly\u2019s infidelity. During the climax, on the night of their wedding, Omi is convinced that Dolly and Kesu have been having an affair behind his back. In rage, he smothers his new wife to death. Langda shoots Kesu with a silent approval from Omi. Kesu is hit with a bullet on his arm. Hearing gunshots and in shock, Indu enters the room where Omi is sitting next to Dolly\u2019s corpse in remorse. Indu notices the kamarbandh and confesses to stealing it; they both understand the fatal misunderstanding with Langda as its root cause. In retribution, Indu slashes Langda's throat and Omi commits suicide. The movie closes with Omi lying dead on the floor and Dolly\u2019s dead body swinging above him, while Kesu looks on. Omkara was shot over a period of 4 months across various locales, including Lonavala, Lucknow University, Allahabad, Satara Mahabaleshwar, Mumbai and Wai, Maharashtra, where bulk of the shooting took place. Even though most of the shooting took place in Maharashtra, sets were erected with precise details to create an authentic Uttar Pradesh village. Members of the production team included stunt co-ordinator Jai Singh, costume designer Dolly Ahluwalia, choreographers Bhushan Lakhandri and Ganesh Acharya along with chief assistant director Ajit Ahuja. The title of the film was decided by a popular vote. Moviegoers had a choice among Omkara, Issak and O Saathi Re, all of which had already appeared as the film's song titles. Aamir Khan was originally considered for Saif Ali Khan's role. Bhardwaj and Aamir were going to collaborate on an earlier project but due to creative differences, the film was shelved. Bhardwaj thought about casting Khan in this film but decided against it and therefore went to Saif. Omkara had a fairly good performance at the box office in India and earned praises all over. The movie grossed $16,466,144 world wide in its total run at the box office. Even though the movie received rave reviews, the dark theme and strong language kept away family audiences. It was, however, a grand success abroad. The film quickly entered the UK's Top Ten and did very well in Australia, South Africa and the United States. Omkara was praised for its taut script, dramatic sequences and its lead performances. Kareena Kapoor's and Ajay Devgan's performance was considered to be the finest of their films. Director Vishal Bhardwaj says it was Aamir Khan who was keen to star in the role of Langda Tyagi initially, but finally it was Saif Ali Khan who played it and drew the most praise for this villainous role, along with Konkana Sen who eventually won a National Award for her performance. All the dialogues in the film are delivered in a strong input of the Khariboli dialect other than Hindi, including the use of swear words, generally absent from mainstream Hindi cinema. The movie received an A Certificate from the censor board of India. Critics and audiences were divided in their opinions about the foul language. Many believed that it was not required and would lead to distancing the movie from the family audience, while on the other hand some applauded it for authentically showing the rustic setting of the story. The language and A certificate narrowed the audience but in turn brought accolades for the creators of the movie for valuing creativity over commercial success. The music is composed by Vishal Bhardwaj and the lyrics are penned by Gulzar. The music was released on 8 July 2006. The official soundtrack contains eight tracks. In January 2009, the track \"Beedi\" was used as the theme tune to a Brazilian TV soap opera called Caminho das \u00cdndias, produced by Rede Globo. On the back of this success, \"Beedi\" received considerable airplay on pop radio stations in Brazil becoming the first Hindi-only song to achieve this. The mini-series' soundtrack, which includes the track, went on to become one of the biggest selling albums of the year. Music Director - Vishal Bhardwaj Nominations are as below;",

        "full_text": " Eros International Om Shanti Om is a 2007 Indian supernatural romantic musical film co-written, choreographed and directed by Farah Khan. It stars Shah Rukh Khan and debutant Deepika Padukone in the lead roles while Arjun Rampal, Shreyas Talpade, and Kirron Kher feature in supporting roles. More than forty-two well-known Hindi movie stars appear in the course of the film, including thirty of them (not including the stars of the film) in one song alone. The film is set in the 1970s and 2000s; it pays tribute to, and pokes fun at, the Indian film industry of both these eras. The film was released in 2,000 prints worldwide making it the largest Indian cinematic release at the time. Om Shanti Om was released on 9 November 2007 to universal acclaim from critics and record-breaking box office collections. It grossed \u20b91.50 billion worldwide and thus became the highest-grossing Hindi film at the time of its release.   Om Prakash Makhija (Shah Rukh Khan) is a junior artist in 1970s Hindi cinema, in love with film star Shanti Priya (Deepika Padukone). One evening, Om views the premiere of Shanti's film Dreamy Girl, posing as Manoj Kumar. Later that night, Om becomes drunk and describes his vision of himself as a famous, wealthy film star winning the Filmfare Award for Best Actor to his friend Pappu (Shreyas Talpade) and some local children. At the shooting of a later film, Om rescues Shanti from a fire scene where the fire has escaped control, and they become friends. One day, after following Shanti, he overhears her and producer Mukesh Mehra's (Arjun Rampal) conversation, that Mukesh and Shanti have married in secret and Shanti is pregnant and expects a traditional wedding. Mukesh says he is really happy with the news, and invites Shanti at the set of their soon-to-be-made film Om Shanti Om. Mukesh promises to cancel the film, reveal their marriage to the public, and have a grand wedding on the set; but instead revealing his true colors traps Shanti on the set and sets it on fire to prevent a financial loss and to protect his career. Shanti tearfully begs Mukesh to release her but he leaves anyway. Om attempts to rescue Shanti, but is attacked by Mukesh's guards. After the guards leave, he again attempts to rescue Shanti and enters the set. He finds Shanti but he is thrown from the building by an explosion. The building explodes after he is thrown from it and Shanti appears to have died. Om is hit by a car owned by Rajesh Kapoor (Javed Sheikh), an actor taking his wife pregnant Lovely to the hospital. At the hospital, Om remembers his moments with Shanti as he dies due to these injuries while Lovely gives birth to a son, also named Om. Om Prakash reincarnates as Om Kapoor and sets out to avenge Shanti's death. He is nicknamed \"O.K.\", and lives the luxurious life imagined by Om Prakash, but experiences pyrophobia and subconsciously inherits Om Prakash's memories. In acceptance of an award, O.K. unexpectedly delivers Om Prakash's drunken speech to the assembly. Pappu hears this on television. At a celebration of his award, O.K. is introduced by his father to Mukesh, and remembers the events that happened in his past life thereupon completely recovering Om Prakash's memories. He later reunites with Om's mother Bela (Kirron Kher) and Pappu and conspires to avenge Shanti's death by making Mukesh confess his crime. To that end, O.K. convinces Mukesh to restart Om Shanti Om, while scheming to convince Mukesh that Shanti's spirit is haunting him. To impersonate Shanti, O.K. finds Sandhya alias Sandy, a doppelg\u00e4nger of Shanti. Throughout the film's shooting, O.K. and his friends arrange incidents to remind Mukesh of his crime. During the music launch of the film, O.K. taunts Mukesh by revealing, through a song, the extent to which he knows the story of Shanti's death. But when Mukesh runs after Sandy thinking she is a ghost of Shanti, Sandy accidentally cuts her arm and bleeds. Seeing this, Mukesh realises that she is not Shanti's ghost. But when he is about to confront O.K, he is suddenly hit by the set's chandelier. After Mukesh awakens, O.K. confronts him but is shocked when Mukesh reveals that he knows who Sandy is. During the quarrel, Sandy shows up. O.K. tries to send Sandy back. Sandy reveals that Mukesh, after the fire ceased to burn, found that Shanti survived the fire, but he buried her alive below the chandelier. O.K. is confused about how Sandy knows this. Mukesh attempts to shoot Sandy, shocked by the extent to which she knows about the murder, but Mukesh and O.K. fight, which results in yet another fire. Just when O.K. is about to kill Mukesh, Sandy stops him, says that Mukesh will not die by his hand, and the chandelier drops on Mukesh, killing him instantly. Pappu and Sandy join O.K. O.K. is shocked when he sees the real Sandy and realises the person he assumed Sandy was actually Shanti's ghost. She smiles warmly towards Om and tearfully bids him goodbye. This is the last time they will ever see each other. The film ends with Shanti's ghost leaving the scene and disappearing into the light. Special appearances during the song \"Deewangi Deewangi\" (in order of appearance) Other Cameo appearances throughout the film (in alphabetical order) The film is based on reincarnation. It is inspired by Rishi Kapoor's 1980 Hindi film Karz and borrows many elements from it, including the title which is named after one of that film's songs. In the beginning of Om Shanti Om, Rishi Kapoor can be seen dancing to the song of the same name. The second half of the film is inspired also by Bimal Roy's Madhumati, which was the first Hindi film that revolved around the concept of reincarnation. Shooting of the film began in January 2007 at various locations in India. The film was released on 9 November 2007. Om Shanti Om created a record of sorts by going in for an unheard of 2000 prints (worldwide) release. This was the highest number of prints (including digital) for any Indian movie at the time of its release. Om Shanti Om set another record for registered pre-advance booking of 18,000 tickets in a chain of theatres in Delhi a few days before the advance booking was to start. Red Chillies Entertainment had reportedly sold the world rights for the film to Eros International for an amount between Rs. 720\u2013750 million. Baba Films, production and distribution company, had offered a record Rs. 110 million for the rights to the Mumbai Circuit, easily surpassing the highest amount ever paid for the territory. A book, titled The Making of Om Shanti Om written by Mushtaq Sheikh, was released after the release of the film. The book gives an insight into the production and happenings behind the camera of the film.  The film's songs were composed by the musical duo Vishal-Shekhar with lyrics by Javed Akhtar, whilst the background score was composed by Sandeep Chowta. Initially, A. R. Rahman was signed in to compose original songs and background score for the film, but he opted out of this movie, as T-Series did not agree to share the copyrights of music with him and the lyricist. The soundtrack for the film released on 18 September 2007. Om Shanti Om opened across 878 cinemas in 2000 prints worldwide. The film nett grossed (after deducting entertainment tax) \u20b9994 million (US$15\u00a0million) in India. The film collected US$2.78 million in the United Kingdom, US$3.6 million in North America and US$3.7 million collectively from the rest of the world, which resulted in total overseas collections of $10,080,000, the 4th largest of all time as of 2010. As a result of these collections, a worldwide gross of \u20b91.50 billion (US$23\u00a0million) was accumulated. Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama gave the film a 4 out 5 star rating, saying \"This Diwali, have a blast! (...) At the box-office, the film will set new records in days to come and has the power to emerge one of the biggest hits of SRK's career.\" Khalid Mohamed of Hindustan Times gave the film 4/5 saying that the film is \"A must for masala movie lovers..\" Tajpal Rathore of BBC gave it 4 out of 5 stars as well and stated, \"Both a homage to and parody of Hindi Films, this cinematic feast delivered straight from the heart of the film industry will have you glued to your seats till the end.\" Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave 3.5 of 5 stars stating the film is a total paisa vasool and a true tribute to Karz (1980). Raja Sen of Rediff.com also gave 3.5 stars and stated, \"Om Shanti Om is an exultant, heady, joyous film reveling in Hindi Films, and as at most parties where the bubbly flows free, there is much silly giggling and tremendous immaturity. You'd do well to breathe in the filmi fumes, lift your own collar-tips upwards, and leave sense out of the equation. More cameos are written in than dialogues, so sit back and play spot-the-celeb. Or watch the Khan have a blast on screen.\" Mark Medley of National Post gave 3 stars and stated, \"The film is a mess for all the right reasons; elements of comedy, drama, romance, action and the supernatural are packed in. But really, the plot is just a vehicle to get from one song-and-dance number to the next.\" AOL India gave the film 3 out of 5 stars stating, \"The movie consists of all the elements that are essentially called the 'navratnas' of Indian cinema\u00a0\u2013 from joy to grief to romance to revenge. And she mixes these well to cook up a potboiler, which is sure to be a run away hit.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave Om Shanti Om 3 out of 5 stars, stated \"A special mention must be made for the film's excellent dialogue which so cleverly incorporates Hindi Moves's oldest clich\u00e9s into these characters' everyday parlance.\" Sudish Kamnath of The Hindu stated, \"Om Shanti Om is a light-hearted tribute to Hindi cinema the way we know it and love it, in spite of its flaws, improvisation and implausibility. [...]That apart, the movie is a hell of a party, a bits-and-pieces blockbuster strung together with a series of laughs, songs and dances. SRK shows us why he's the rock star of our times.\" Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave Om Shanti Om a rating of 83%, based upon 6 reviews (5 fresh and 1 rotten). Nina Davuluri's talent for Miss America 2014 was a Hindi Film fusion dance choreographed by Nakul Dev Mahajan and performed to Dhoom Taana. It was the first time Hindi Film ever appeared on the Miss America stage and Davuluri is the first Indian American to win the competition. Manoj Kumar planned to sue the makers of Om Shanti Om for showing his body double in a bad taste. Kumar added, \"Are the Mumbai police so stupid that they can't recognise Manoj Kumar and lathicharge him in the '70s when he was a star?\u201d. Kumar also alleged that Shahrukh Khan is communal. Later, in a press conference, Shahrukh Khan and director Farah Khan accepted their mistake and apologised for the matter. Farah Khan even offered to cut the scene which Manoj Kumar felt was hurtful, but Kumar refused on grounds that, as Farah had stated, \"I [Farah Khan] am like his daughter. He said, 'Betiyaan maafi nahi maangti' (Daughters don't ask for forgiveness). I told him that he could've called me and scolded me.\" Later, Kumar said that though this incident was hurtful to him, he wishes to forgive, ignore, and move on, saying that he prefers to \"see Ram in everyone and ignore the Ravana.\" In 2008, before the film's television premiere on Sony TV, Manoj Kumar filed for a stay on the television release, at civil court in Mumbai. On 8 August 2008, he won permanent injunction on the scenes in Om Shanti Om that lampooned him. The court ordered the producers and Sony Entertainment Television, to edit the Manoj Kumar look-alike scenes before showing the film on the channel on 10 August 2008. It also ordered that the film could not be shown in any media\u2014TV, DVD or Internet\u2014without the scene being deleted. On 7 August 2008, before its television release, scriptwriter Ajay Monga, moved the Bombay High Court alleging that the basic storyline of the film was lifted from a film script he had emailed to Shah Rukh Khan in 2006. According to the petition, \"Monga, along with one more writer Hemant Hegde, had registered the script with the Cine Writers Association (CWA) in September 2005. In January 2008, Cine Writers Association (CWA) rejected Monga's appeal at a special Executive Committee meeting. Thereafter, he approached the court to stay the film's screening on television. Though, on 6 August the court rejected Monga's plea for seeking a stay on the television telecast, it directed all the respondents including Shahrukh Khan, Farah Khan, Red Chillies Entertainment, Gauri Khan (director Red Chillies) and film's co-writer Mushtaq Sheikh, to file their say by the next hearing on 29 September 2008. In November 2008, the Film Writers' association sent a communication to Red Chillies and Ajay Monga that it had found similarities in Om Shanti Om and Monga's script. The similarities were more than mere coincidences according to Sooni Taraporewala who chaired a special committee that has investigated the case on behalf of the Film Writers' association. Another allegation of plagiarism came from Rinki Bhattacharya, daughter of late Bimal Roy, who directed Madhumati. She threatened legal action against Red Chillies Entertainment and the producer-director of Om Shanti Om, as she felt that the film's second half was similar to Madhumati, also a rebirth saga.

        "full_text": " Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai is a 2010 Indian gangster thriller film directed by Milan Luthria and produced by Ekta Kapoor. It stars Ajay Devgan, Emraan Hashmi, Kangana Ranaut, Prachi Desai and Randeep Hooda. The film is produced under Balaji Motion Pictures and released on 30 July 2010. Once Upon A Time in Mumbaai received generally positive reviews from critics and was a box office success. Its sequel, Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! was released on 15 August 2013. It featured Akshay Kumar replacing Hashmi from the first film alongside Imran Khan. The filming for the sequel began in August 2012 apparently in Qatar. The sequel received negative reviews from both critics and audiences and performed poorly at the box office.   The film opens with a suicide attempt by Additional Commissioner of Police (ACP) Agnel Wilson (Randeep Hooda) on the pretext of the Bombay Bombings in 1993. When questioned by his superior over his actions, he breaks down and claims that the recent tragic events are his own fault. Wilson recounts that 18 years ago, when he was posted as the ACP in the Mumbai crime branch, his inability to take the necessary action led to the rise of Shoaib Khan (Emraan Hashmi) a dreaded gangster, who played a central role in the bombings. Throughout the film, Wilson narrates the story of 1970s Bombay, when it was ruled by a kind hearted smuggler Sultan Mirza (Ajay Devgn), and how Mirza's eventual downfall led to Shoaib's rise to power. After being hit by a flood in his hometown in Madras, a young Mirza arrives in Mumbai, where he lands a job as a coal shoveller. In spite of his meager earnings, the boy never fails to help the poor and needy, which soon gains their respect and admiration. Mirza is given the nickname of \"Sultan.\" As a grown man, Sultan Mirza becomes the kingpin of Mumbai's smuggling underworld. Through his influence, Mirza peacefully divides the city among four gangsters, thus thwarting police efforts to curb illegal activities. Despite being a criminal, Sultan Mirza is portrayed as a man of principle with a heart of gold and a godfather-like figure to the people. He even refrains from smuggling contraband, as it is against his Muslim faith. Mirza has a crush on Bollywood actress Rehana (Kangana Ranaut) and eventually the two begin dating. Sultan invests black money in her upcoming films. ACP Wilson moves to stop Rehana's films funded by Sultan. Later, Sultan and Rehana frame Wilson to make it look as if Wilson is accepting a bribe, which damages his credibility. Meanwhile, Shoaib is even in childhood a very ambitious person with a dark and daring character. He is frequently involved in petty theft. His father, Hussain Khan (Asif Basra), who is a sub-inspector with the Bombay Police, tries in vain to guide and control his son, his anger against Shoaib began years ago when Shoaib and his best friend Javed were stealing money and got caught red handed by a man, by teaching his son a lesson, Khan slaps him 5 times. Khan locks Shoaib in jail but Shoaib angers him as both Shoaib and Wilson make a deal saying that Shoaib wants to follow another path. Worried, the father turns to Sultan for help. Sultan agrees and helps the young man set up an electronics shop. But Shoaib is unsatisfied, as his only real ambition is to become rich and powerful, like Sultan Mirza who is his idol. Shoaib's beautiful girlfriend, Mumtaz (Prachi Desai), works in a local jewellery shop, which Shoaib visits often, to the aggravation of the girl's boss. Shoaib gives her a beautiful necklace, which, unbeknownst to Mumtaz, Shoaib had stolen from a lady during a home robbery. Later, that lady comes to the shop with her husband to buy more jewellery. The lady soon recognises her own necklace being worn by Mumtaz; she then admits to the outraged customer that her boyfriend had given the item to her. The lady and her husband demand she take them to her boyfriend's shop, where they confront him. This enrages Shoaib, who beats up the husband and destroys his own shop. Shoaib goes to Sultan and asks to be a part of his crime ring. Seeing his potential, Sultan agrees to take him under his wing. Shoaib learns the tricks of the trade and soon becomes Sultan's trusted aide. ACP Wilson hatches a plan to use Shoaib's reckless ambition for quick money and power as a way to cause the downfall of Sultan. Wilson even refrains from killing Sultan and Shoaib when he has the opportunity. Wilson's plan backfires, however. Finally, when Shoaib becomes invincible, Wilson blames himself for the subsequent catastrophe as he now cannot stop Shaoibs rise to power. Sultan decides to hand over his power to Shoaib, and opts to enter state politics. He travels to Delhi to meet the Home Minister of India. Shoaib's unscrupulous ambitions lead him to carry out trades and acts which Sultan himself would strongly condemn and abhors. Shoaib starts manufacturing illicit liquor, accepts contract killings, invests in drug peddling and runs extortion rackets. When Sultan returns to Bombay, he learns of Shoaib's misdeeds and is outraged. He finds Shoaib at a party and slaps him in public for his unethical activities and states he can never really be like Sultan. This infuriates Shoaib and he plots revenge as he now knows that Sultan and he cannot possibly rule Mumbai together due to Mirza's strong principals and moral ethos. The next day, as Sultan campaigns for his new party, Shoaib appears and assassinates Sultan Mirza whilst he is addressing the people at the rally as a horrified Wilson looks on, thus ending the reign of the smuggler who was loved by his people. In his narration, Wilson laments that he and the police are responsible for the bombings because of their lack of forethought, Wilson also says that Shoaib now rules Mumbai despite living abroad and the people are now forever at his mercy \u2013 as Mumbai's new underworld kingpin \u2013 he has since established a global smuggling empire. No government or force can reach him now. The film was made on a budget of \u20b938 crore (\u20b9 28 crore for production and \u20b9 10 crore for publicity and advertising). The film depicts the growth of the Mumbai underworld, from crime and smuggling in its early stages to its connection with international terrorism in recent times. It is believed to be based on the lives of real-life gangsters Haji Mastan and Dawood Ibrahim, portrayed by the characters Sultan and Shoaib, respectively. Originally Sanjay Dutt was chosen to play the role of Haji Mastan but the role went to Ajay Devgn instead. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN rated the film 2.5 out of 5 saying, \"The film is watchable and enjoyable in parts even, but it doesn't quite pull off the retro chic tone it was going for\". IANS rated the movie 3.5 out of 5 saying, \"Rajat Arora\u2019s dialogues flow from the storytelling in a smooth flow of poetry and street wisdom.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave it 4/5 and called it \"An outstanding Cinematic experience\". Nikhat Kazmi of the Times of India gave it 4/5 and stated, \"Once Upon A Time in Mumbaai offers you both substance and soul, even as it dabbles with a slice of reality\". Rediff gave it 4/5 and said, \"Book your tickets now\". Once Upon A Time in Mumbaai managed to have a decent weekend despite starting slowly.

        "full_text": " Paa (Hindi: \u092a\u093e, English: Father) is a 2009 Indian comedy-drama film directed by R. Balakrishnan (credited onscreen as R. Balki) starring Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, and Vidya Balan. The film is based on a rare genetic condition known as progeria and places emphasis on a father-son relationship. Amitabh Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan, in real life, are father and son respectively, but in Paa, they played opposite roles. The film was released worldwide on 4 Dec 2009. Veteran composer Ilaiyaraaja scored the music. The film was critically acclaimed in India and fared well at the box office. Despite a warm reception from Indian film critics, the film received mixed reviews from overseas film critics, according to the websites Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes. Amitabh Bachchan received his third National Film Award for Best Actor at the 57th National Film Awards for his performance and his fifth Filmfare Best Actor Award and Vidya Balan got her first Filmfare Best Actress Award.   Auro (Amitabh Bachchan) is an intelligent and witty 12-year-old boy with an extremely rare genetic disorder called progeria. Mentally he is twelve and very normal, but physically he looks five times older. In spite of his condition, Auro is a very happy boy. He lives with his mother Vidya (Vidya Balan), who is a Gynaecologist. Amol Arte (Abhishek Bachchan) is a young, cold-blooded politician. He is out to prove to the world that \"politics\" is not a bad word. He is a man with a mission. Auro is Amol's son; however, Vidya conceals this from him. Amol meets Auro when he visits Auro's school as a chief guest. He comes on the occasion of a competition on the \"visionary of India\". Amol decides Auro as the winner, impressed by the white globe he made. But being with such a big politician Auro was found by the media. The next day the media tries to enter his school. Auro, annoyed at this, sends him an e-mail, which says \"I hate you\". Amol reads it and takes a restraining order from High Court stating that nobody can disturb him without permission. Auro, relieved, tells him of his desire to visit the president's house. But due Amol's political issues he fails to make it on the decided day. Auro, however, loses confidence in him but later agrees to go to Delhi with him although he now knows that Amol is his father. Though Amol does not know that Auro is his son, he takes him to Delhi to see the president's house. Auro says that he still needs to forgive Amol for his first mistake (not accepting him), but he doesn't tell him what it is. When on his 13th birthday he is in hospital he tells his mistake. Auro tries to get his mother and father back together, but Vidya resists, still hurt by the fact that Amol wanted her to have an abortion when they first found out she was pregnant. Amol realises his mistake though, and proposes to Vidya, as he is still in love with her. He stays by Auro's side when he finds out that Auro is his son. Auro's health begins to deteriorate as he reaches his 13th birthday, his physical defects catching up. However, he is finally able to reunite his mother and father once again as Vidya gives in to her feelings for Amol and her motherly love for Auro. They get married in the hospital a fake one, so they can do the real one later. Auro, succumbing to his disease, says his last words \"Maa\" to Vidya and \"Paa\" to Amol before dying with a satisfied smile. The movie ends in the rain with Vidya mourning Auro's death as Amol comforts her as she remembers Auro dancing. The film had Amitabh Bachchan playing the role of a child who is suffering from Progeria, a genetic disorder which leads to quick acceleration of ageing process in children. Abhishek Bachchan, Amitabh's real-life son played the role of his father. Vidya Balan was the only choice for the mother's role. She suited well for this role. Initially, she was criticised for putting on weight, but it was certain, as she played Auro's mother. Arundathi Nag, the wife of late Kannada actor-director Shankar Nag was asked to play the role of Vidya's mother (Bachchan's maternal grandmother). Most of the parts were shot in Lucknow and some parts of the film were shot in UK and Malaysia. A small portion of the filming was done at Cambridge. The clock of Corpus Christi College and courtyard of St. John's College have been shown in a song sequence. The film was also shot in Taiping, Malaysia. The King Edward VII school was actually one of the typical Malaysian schools. One of the notable things in the movie was the Amitabh's prosthetic make up. It was done by Hollywood's Christien Tinsley (famous for his work in The Passion of the Christ, Catwoman and other films) and Dominie Till of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy fame. There was a plan to make a sequel named Maa, but Balki stopped it. In the words of Balki, \"My main aim was not to make a film on progeria. My main motive behind making Paa was to reverse the roles of Amitabh and Abhishek. I decided to do something like this because once I was with both of them and I saw Abhishek behaving in a very matured manner. It was then that this idea struck me.\" Paa was Abhishek Bachchan's first venture into producing films for his family company AB Corp. Ltd. Abhishek not only was one of the lead actors in Paa, but was the main hands-on producer in charge of the film's budget, marketing, and the entire production of the film. It took hours for Amitabh Bachchan to put on his makeup and to take it off. The soundtrack (songs and the background score) was scored by veteran composer Ilaiyaraaja. \"Halke Se Bole\" is based on the Tamil song \"Putham Pudhu Kaalai\" from his 1980 film Alaigal Oivathillai. \"Gumm Summ Gumm\" is based on the Malayalam song \"Thumbi Vaa\" which Ilaiyaraaja had composed for the 1982 Malayalam film Olangal. The song \"Mere Paa\" is based on his Tamil song \"Kaatru Vizhi\", from Balu Mahendra's film Adhu Oru Kana Kaalam. The song has an eclectic mix of Irish and Tamil Folk music, both seamlessly fused to create a soothing melody that appears as a leitmotif, in the film's theme music.",

The music is by Ghulam Mohammed and Naushad Ali. The film starred Meena Kumari, Raaj Kumar, Ashok Kumar, Nadira, D.K. Sapru and Veena . Meena Kumari's performance as a golden-hearted Lucknow nautch-girl drew major praise. Sadly, this was to be Meena Kumari's last performance. Kamal Amrohi's PR man said \"Shah Jahan made Taj Mahal for his wife, Kamal Sahab wanted to do the same with Pakeezah.\". The concept, Kamal Amrohi says was irretrievably fixed with his love for his wife Meena Kumari. According to Kamal Amrohi, he hoped to create a film which would be worthy of her as an actress, and worthy of the love he felt for her as a woman. Meena Kumari regarded the film as Kamal Amrohi's tribute to her. The film tells the story set in Muslim Lucknow at the turn of the century, its central character is a Lucknowi nautch-girl, for her to fall in love was forbidden, it was a sin she was told, a nautch-girl is born to delight others such is her destiny and yet her restless soul could not suppress her surging desire - \"To Love and Be Loved\". It was ostensibly, or loosely based on Kamal Amrohi and Meena Kumari's own love story. Pakeezah took 16 years to reach the silver screen. Pakeezah released on 3 February 1972, with a grand premiere at Maratha Mandir theatre in central Mumbai and Meena Kumari attended the last premiere of her life along with Kamal Amrohi. Already battling liver cirrhosis, Meena Kumari was ill throughout the completion of the film and died only a few weeks after it was finally released. It was Meena Kumari\u2019s last great performance and one that solidified her reputation as a legendary actress. An Indian critic has said Pakeezah was \"Poetry, fantasy and nostalgia rolled into one on an epic scale\".   This movie is about a tawaif Sahibjaan (Meena Kumari), who is born to a courtesan, Nargis (also Meena Kumari). After being spurned by her lover Shahabuddin's (Ashok Kumar) family, Nargis is driven to a graveyard where she gives birth to Sahibjaan secretly. Nargis dies during childbirth and her sister Nawabjaan (Veena), a brothel madam, brings her up as her own. Unable to break away from the vicious circle, Sahibjaan grows up to be a beautiful and popular dancer and singer. The aggressive, Nawab Zafar Ali Khan (Kamal Kapoor), wants to make her his own with the help of the brothel madam, and takes her to his boat for the night, which is attacked by elephants, saving Sahibjaan from a horrific fate, but throwing her in the fast flowing river, in a broken boat. Whence here she is taken to the riverside tent of Forest ranger Salim Ahmed Khan (Raaj Kumar), where alone with his diary, she reads how he was the same man who had written a beautiful couplet on her feet, and left for her to read it, while travelling in the same compartment some time before. She sings in rapture and love, remembering this beautiful interlude in her otherwise barren life. Salim Ahmed Khan returns to his tent and is pleasantly surprised to find her. Enthralled by her beauty and innocence, he eventually convinces her to elope with him, which she does. But trials and tribulations await Sahibjaan as she is recognized by men wherever she goes in the company of Salim. When Salim renames her Pakeezah (pure of heart) and takes her to a cleric to be legally married, she refuses and returns to the brothel. Salim eventually decides to marry someone else and invites Sahibjaan to dance at his wedding, to which she agrees. During this event, Nawabjaan recognises Shahabuddin and calls him to witness the irony of the situation; his own daughter dancing and entertaining his family. Shahabuddin's brother tries to shoot Nawabjaan to silence her, which leads to a very surprise ending. \"Shah Jahan made Taj Mahal for his wife, Kamal Sahab wanted to do the same with Pakeezah.\" In 1955 Meena Kumari and Kamal Amrohi were in South India and here Kamal Amrohi began outlining the plot of his next film with his wife Meena Kumari and decided that he would call it Pakeezah(the name has a fascinating history too. It was changed many times due to superstitious reasons, but finally the original stayed. After the failure of Daera in 1953, Pakeezah as an idea was roaming Amrohi's mind. A concept, Kamal Amrohi says was irretrievably fixed with his love for his wife Meena Kumari, he hope to create a film which would be would be worthy of her as an actress, and worthy of the love he felt for her as a women. Kamal Amrohi declares that every line he wrote he had Meena in mind. He wished to present her on the screen as no one had before: beautiful, sad, sanguine, dejected, calculating, sexy he ambitioned to capture as many dimensions of her as he knew of.Meena Kumari regarded the film as Kamal Amrohi tribute to her. Kamal Amrohi son Tajdar Amrohi raised by Meena Kumari said \"What you see in Pakeezah is exactly how our home looked like -- the same windows, chandeliers, arches and curtains.\" The grandfather's character was taken from Amrohi's father. \"The dining table sequence in which Raaj Kumar says, 'Afsos, log doodh se bhi jal jaate hai (Alas, people get burnt by milk, too),' was inspired by everyday domestic scenes at our home. \"When an elder enters the room, the womenfolk put on their veil. This is what baba showed in Pakeezah and that's how women at our home behaved.\"says Tajdar, \"And his romance with my chhoti ammi was very dignified. Despite being separated, they felt for each other. But they never divorced as rumours go. They loved each other and chhoti ammi respected my father and never allowed anyone to say anything against him.\" \u2018Pakeezah is the beloved which has been born of this film-maker\u2019s imagination nearly two decades ago. Pakeezah is the vision which has haunted his soul for as long as I can remember.\u2019 . In 1964, Kamal Amrohi and Meena Kumari got separated due to their mutual differences but the sepration never led to formal divorce. The project came to a halt In moments of desperation, Kamal thought of a substitute for Meena Kumari. He even made some sort of search, but each time he came back from where he had started. The one and only woman who could play Sahebjan was Meena Kumari. According to Vinod Mehta, Meena Kumari had a special niche for Pakeezah. There is however one sentence worth considering: \u2018the surging desire to love and be loved\u2019. And it was this line in which Meena saw a reflection of her life.  Kamal Amrohi himself pronounced, \u2018Pakeezah is Meena Kumari.\u2019 It was planned together by Kamal Amrohi and Meena Kumari in 1958 and at first, was launched as a Black & White venture. Later with color technology coming in, Kamal Amrohi started it all again in the new color format. But soon after that when Cinemascope also got introduced, Amrohi now wanted to shoot it in Cinemascope. So he brought the required lens from MGM on royalty basis and started shooting. However, after a while an error was detected in the shoot being done with the new lens. The matter was reported to MGM, who after studying the problem, didn\u2019t collect their due royalties and also gifted that lens to Amrohi as an appreciation gesture. The film was still being made, when in 1964, Kamal Amrohi and Meena Kumari got separated due to their mutual differences. The project came to a halt for some time when it was more than halfway complete. Kamal Amrohi wrote a letter to his estranged wife on 24 August 1968. \"Only Pakeezah completion remain unsettled.You have made a condition that unless i give you a divorce you will not complete Pakeezah. Even this knot can be untied ... I will free you from your marital ties. After this if you wish to complete your Pakeezah. I would be the most happy to do so. This is my request, that Pakeezah on which the fortune of many people depends, and which had the good wishes of so many people should not be left uncompleted if possible. You have better means. You have box-office appeal, and most of all Pakeezah needs you personally ... Pakeezah that is like a sinking ship will reach a shore under your care.\" Meena Kumari wrote to her husband Kamal Amrohi in the early 1969 \"In regard to my working in Pakeezah, I have always been willing and clamouring to work. Pakeezah is my life dream and it will be my greatest pleasure to see it completed. As for my remuneration, I am glad you have given me an opportunity to prove my regards and respect for you. I shall accept only ONE GUINEA as a token of goodwill for my entire work in Pakeezah.\" As the shooting again started in 1968, Meena Kumari was suffering from liver cirrhosis and was in serious critical condition under observation. But since, Kumari was still Amrohi's only choice, she agreed to complete the film, despite her severe ill health conditions. on 16 March 1969, five years and twelve days after Kumari left her husband, Gravelly ill, Meena Kumari reported for work again on Pakeezah. Kamal Amrohi organized a great reception. He gave his wife a peda(sweet) as a peace offering, and made a documentary film on her arrival at the studio. Meena Kumari was determined to complete the film and, was well aware of the limited time left for her to live, went out of her way to complete it at the earliest. Meena Kumari condition became so bad that during the filming of the last song \u201cTeer-e Nazar,\u201d Meena Kumari collapsed. A body double, Padma Khanna, was used. Meena Kumari personally trained her for the scene, Padma Khanna\u2019s face remained veiled throughout the song and the veil was lifted at instances to show Meena Kumari\u2019s face. In 1958, at the initial stages the following had been signed: Josef Wirsching as photographer, Ghulam Mohammed as music director, Ashok Kumar as the hero, Meena Kumari as the heroine, and a handful of Urdu writers as lyricists Kaifi Azmi, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Kaif Bhopali including Kamal Amrohi. When the project got resumed in 1964 , Amrohi was confronted with another difficulty Ashok Kumar was getting no younger. He had to find a younger leading man for his film. Dharmendra, Rajendra Kumar, Raaj Kumar and Sunil Dutt were considered for the same role which eventually went to Raaj Kumar. Raaj Kumar and Kamal Amrohi had worked previously together in Dil Apna Aur Preet Parayi, and according to Kamal Amrohi the one thing that he liked about Raaj Kumar was his voice. Not only did Raaj Kumar speak literate Hindustani, he spoke it well and deep. And after finalizing Raaj Kumar the role was modified from being a businessman\u2019s character to a forest officer according to the strong built and impressive persona of Raaj Kumar. Two conspicuous deaths were those of Ghulam Mohammed and Josef Wirsching. During the making of the film, composer 'Ghulam Mohammed' and cinematographer Josef Wirsching died, leaving director Kamal Amrohi at a loss. Eventually, though, composer Naushad was brought in to compose the background score; and after Wirsching's death, over a dozen of Bombay's top cinematographers stepped in as/when they had a break from their other assignments, and they maintained an even look. A one-and-a-half-crore rupee film, CinemaScope, Eastmancolor, sixteen years in the making, Kamal Amrohi sketched all the set designs and camera movements, and personally selected every costume, right down to the bangles worn by the minor characters. Tajdar Amrohi said the haveli in Pakeezah is Inspired by their family haveli back home in Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, Kamal Amrohi recreated the exact replica in Mumbai. Most of the film was shot at Filmistan Studios where the magnificent sets were mounted. The chandeliers were imported from Belgium and bills of the carpets alone ran into lakhs. Vinod Mehta said, \" Kamal Amrohi saw in Pakeezah an epic, a larger-than-life film with hundreds of extras, with expensive and exotic sets, with superhuman effort made to preserve period flavour; and all this he wished to do with the collected professional proficiency he had acquired in nearly two decades. This was no do-it-yourself cinema; instead, it was visioned as the ultimate in spectacle and pageantry.\" . When \u201cPakeezah\u201d was resumed in 1968, many exhibitors suggested Kamal Amrohi to change the music according to the then famous trend and style. To this Amrohi said that he would have readily done this if only 'Ghulam Mohammed' was still breathing alive. But, now he cannot betray a man, who gave him such melodious songs, after his unexpected and untimely death. So he kept his music intact, but used fewer songs as planned to keep up with the fast changing times. . Ghulam Mohammed, the music director of Pakeezah, sadly could not be alive to see the success of his film. It is said that he did not get his due in the Hindi Film Industry in spite of his brilliant work in films like Mirza Ghalib (1954) and Shama (1961). The legendary composer Naushad was brought in to do the background score for the movie and he also added some fine \u2018Thumris\u2019 in it as required. After few years HMV (now SAREGAMA) released all the remaining 9 unreleased tracks in a different LP titled PAKEEZAH \u2013 RANG BARANG, about which many are still not aware of. On 3 February, in the Arabian Sea a \u2018Pakeezah Boat\u2019 was sailing and in Maratha Mandir the premiere was scheduled. Pakeezah film released on 3 February 1972, with a grand premiere at Maratha Mandir theatre in central Mumbai and the prints being carried on a decked-up palanquin. Meena Kumari arrived to attend the last premiere of her life. Kumari let Raaj Kumar, for the benefit of the press, Raaj Kumar kissed her hand and then she went in to see the film. Meena Kumari seated next with Kamal Amrohi during the premiere. When Mohammed Zahur Khayyam complimented Meena Kumari with \"shahkar ban gaya\" (it's priceless), she was in tears. After watching complete Pakeezah Meena Kumari told a friend that she was convinced that her husband Kamal Amrohi was the finest film-maker in India. Pakeezah is India\u2019s first colour film in Cinemascope and Meena Kumari's most awaited film and has since acquired major cult status as well. Tajdar Amrohi shares \"When Pakeezah shooting started again in 1969 the first song shot was \"Mausam Hai Ashiqana\" with this song Meena Kumari set a new fashion trend of girls wearing Lungi. Indian Film Critics Soumya Bavya says \"Pakeezah is just like poetry on celluloid I can not imagine anybody else in this movie except Meena Kumari.\" Pakeezah music is cited as greatest classical album in Hindi cinema history and was one of the best-selling Bollywood albums of the 1970s. \"I has lived with Pakeezah almost aslong as i lived with its creator ... to Meena Kumari Pakeezah means a performance. A great performance? That is not for me to say: that is for people to decide. For me to say is this: it is a performance to deliver which I have, as an actress, had to delve deeper into the secret wells of being than any actor or actress normally delves in the process of his or her professional work.\" Pakeezah was the inaugural film telecast by Doordarshan, India's state-owned television station, when it began broadcasting from Amritsar in Punjab in the early 70s. It was specially beamed towards Lahore nearby, in Pakistan. Thousands flocked at Lahore, from as far as Karachi, hundreds of miles away, to see Pakeezah. It was a flood the crowds stampeded the streets of Lahore to get to the television screens placed at strategic points on virtually every street corner. Vinod Mehta (the biographer of Meena Kumari) shared an incident which occurred during the last days of Pakeezah shooting \"On outdoor shooting Kamal Amrohi's unit travelled in two cars near a place called Shivpuri in Madhya Pradesh, the cars all but ran out of patrol , and for miles around there was nothing except a long, deserted, straight road. It was discovered that a bus passed on this route every morning from which fuel could be purchased. Kamal Amrohi decided to spend the night in desert he ordered his unit roll up the windows of the cars and hope for the best. A little after midnight the occupants of the vehicles were surrounded by a dozen armed men. The men knocked on the closed windows and forced their way in. when the armed gang leader learned that one of the persons in the car was Meena Kumari, his attitude completely changed. He turned out to be a Meena Kumari fan and welcomed his guests in true fan tradition. He organized music, dancing, and food. He provided place to sleep. He instructed his juniors the next morning to fetch petrol for the unit. From Meena Kumari, he wanted a special favour. He sharpened his knife and took it to her. \u2018Please autograph my hand with this,\u2019 he requested. Meena was not new to signing autographs but she had never attempted anything as ambitious as a knife. Nervously, she wrote her name on this man's hand. He said he was grateful for this favour. Once the unit left, they found at the next town that they had spent the night in the camp of Madhya Pradesh's renowned and dangerous dacoit\u2014Amrit Lal.\" Dwyer and Patel have argued that the Pakeezah courtesan genre is responsible for \u201csome of the most extravagant and beautiful sets and costumes in the history of the Hindi film\u201d \u2013 or the pooling of a golden, artificial light that paints his actress as she returns to the Pink Palace. Hence, if Pakeezah\u2019s narrative structure (which is also to say its use of time) derives from the codes and conventions of Bollywood filmmaking, as does nominally its emphasis on art design as a source of spectatorial pleasure, Amrohi\u2019s spatial articulations and handling of light underscore his individualized sensibility. In this respect, Pakeezah does more justify the popular Indian cinema; it manifests the artistic sensibility of a truly \u2018rare\u2026 connoisseur.\u2019  Meena Kumari delivers a phenomenal performance as the leading female protagonist, especially given the circumstances, as she was terminally ill when filming resumed. It is perhaps one of her greatest works along with Baiju Bawra (1952), Parineeta (1953) and Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam (1962). These are all films which have helped to consolidate her status as the tragedienne of Indian cinema. The film is also known as one of the historical films which display the sophistication and elegance of Muslim culture in India. Books and documentaries made about the film include Meghnad Desai's Pakeezah: An Ode to a Bygone World. The film also includes in 101 Hit Films of Indian Cinema. Filmmaker/critic Peter Wollen, named Pakeezah as one of the ten best movies ever made in the 1992 \"Sight and Sound\" poll.  Pakeezah ranks on the lists of top Indian films, including the 2002 British Film Institute poll of Top 10 Indian Films. Pakeezah is also remembered for being one of the last great films to have starred the legendary actress Meena Kumari. The soundtrack for the film was composed by Ghulam Mohammed and Naushad, with lyrics by Kaifi Azmi, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Kamal Amrohi and Kaif Bhopali. Due to the demise of the composer before the completion of the film, Naushad was signed to compose the background score for the film. He also composed the songs, Nazaria Ki Maari, Title Music - Alap, Mora Saajan Sauten Ghar Jaye and Kaun Gali Gayo Shyam. These renderings are presented in the voices of the veteran singer Rajkumari, Parveen Sultana, Vani Jairam and Naseem Bano Chopra. There were total 18 songs recorded, however only 9 of them were used in the film.",

        "full_text": " Pardes (English: Foreign Land) is a 1997 Bollywood musical drama film directed by Subhash Ghai. It was released on 8 August 1997. The film stars Shahrukh Khan, Amrish Puri, Alok Nath, and newcomers Mahima Chaudhry and Apurva Agnihotri. The film was a commercial, critical and musical hit. Mahima Chaudary won the Best Newcomer Award for her performance. The film was remade in Telugu as Pelli Kanuka (1998).   Pardes is a story that revolves around Arjun (Shah Rukh Khan) and Ganga (Mahima Chaudhary). Kishorilal Saagar (Amrish Puri), a wealthy Indian businessman living in America, visits his old friend Suraj Dev (Alok Nath) in India. During his stay at the conservative, traditional Indian household, he gets to know Suraj's eldest daughter, Ganga, who shares his love for India and Indian culture. Ganga's younger siblings are enchanted by the uncle from America, and because they perceive Western culture and values to be so desirable, they cook up a plan to impress him with an English song. Unimpressed, he sings back a hymn-like song in a more traditional Indian style, \"I love my India.\" Ganga joins in this song, expressing her equal love for India. The song emphasises the movie's theme in key moments. Kishorilal asks Suraj to promise Ganga as a bride for his westernised son, Rajiv (Apoorva Agnihotri). He is convinced that Ganga will be not only a perfect bride, but the way treasured Indian values are revived and passed on in his Americanized family and large circle of Indian friends and business acquaintances. Suraj's family accepts the proposal. Kishorilal knows he will have a tough time trying to convince his son to marry or even meet Ganga. Back in America, he asks his foster son, Arjun (Shahrukh Khan) to help his plan along. Arjun, who has been working in Kishorilal's personal garage and making music with his band, is being interviewed as the composer of the new musical hit \"I Love My India\". However, when Kishorilal calls to ask for his help, his loyalty to his uncle is so strong that he cuts the interview short. Arjun flies to India ahead of Rajiv to set the stage for him to meet Ganga, unintentionally offending Ganga's family with a barrage of orders that includes removing farm animals from sight and relocating their servant. When \"Ganga\" is first introduced, she is hideously made up, with horn-rimmed glasses and buck teeth, sending Arjun into a panic about the success of Kishorilal's plans. Later, when he meets the authentic Ganga, he is entranced, and in an effort to make up for his offensive behaviour, promises to be a trustworthy friend. Immediately after they shake hands, Ganga moves the farm animals and the servant back into the enclosed yard. She explains to Arjun that her family loves all who are a part of it, even animals and servants, in contrast to Arjun's apparent and somewhat Western view that they are not very important. When Rajiv arrives, he also acts offensively; sometimes intentionally, and sometimes because he has no idea of what Indians consider rude or inappropriate. But Arjun, despite his own attraction to Ganga, smooths the way out of loyalty to Rajiv and Kishorilal. In his determination to help the marriage come to pass, Arjun deceives Ganga about Rajiv's character and habits; he assures her that Rajiv is a \"nice guy\"; he also covers up for Rajiv, telling Ganga the cigarettes she found in Rajiv's room are his own. Rajiv and Ganga agree to the wedding. The engagement is set in India, but the families agree that Ganga should come to America before the wedding. Ganga arrives in America, and is hurt to hear her traditional dress and \"foreign\" manners despised by Rajiv's snaky mother at a party in her new home. However, at a very large and influential gathering arranged by Kishorilal, she is invited to sing. She sings \"I love my India\" and receives warm, sincere applause. In her new surroundings, her only friend and confidant is Arjun, with whom she begins to form a special bond. Little by little Ganga realises that Rajiv isn't the person Arjun portrayed him to be. Rajiv not only seems eager to leave her at home whenever possible, with little explanation or apology; when he does bring her out with his friends, he smokes, gets drunk and acts like a bully. At one party, he is drinking and flirting with other women while a Western man begins dancing too closely with Ganga; though Rajiv ignores the situation, Arjun loses his temper and fights the man to the ground. Later, Ganga is shocked to discover pictures of Rajiv with his girlfriend that clearly show he has had a sexual relationship with her. She is also astonished to find that Kishorilal's family treats Arjun, a near relative and loyal friend, as a servant, contemptuously dismissing the idea of his joining them for dinner or even eating in the same house. When Rajiv abandons Ganga for dinner with his girlfriend, who he is still seeing, Ganga confronts Arjun. Arjun justifies Rajiv's behaviour, reminding Ganga that Rajiv lives like an American, and that she should not make a fuss about such a petty affair. This exchange leads to a key monologue from Ganga. Infuriated that Arjun sees Rajiv's casual, unapologetic unfaithfulness as a \"petty affair\", she tells him that she demands love \u2013 the kind of love he (Arjun) gives others. Rejecting \"love\" that is less, she further rejects being made into a decoration to fit into Kishorilal's palatial mansion. Arjun realises that he has fallen in love with Ganga, but because of his immense loyalty to Kishorilal, he continues to encourage her to stay with the engagement and worry about \"changing\" Rajiv later. On the next day, Arjun's birthday, he is depressed and wants to be alone. However, Ganga finds out and asks Rajiv to go with her to wish Arjun a happy birthday. Rajiv rudely refuses, making it clear he also views Arjun as some kind of servant. Ganga visits the garage without Rajiv, joining a surprise party thrown by Arjun's band mates. Inevitably, Rajiv's hostile aunt Neeta notices the growing friendship between Ganga and Arjun and warns Kishorilal. He arranges for Arjun to leave the city immediately, telling him he has been promoted, and must start with a board meeting the following morning in another city. Kishorilal then informs Rajiv, who is on his way to another party in Las Vegas, that he must take Ganga with him. In Las Vegas, Rajiv gets drunk and reveals his true contempt and hatred for India; he derides Indians as \"hypocrites\", and \"stupid\". Ganga heatedly responds that Indians hate America's drug-riddled, amoral alternative. Furious, he tries to rape Ganga; after a violent struggle, she knocks him unconscious and flees. Kishorilal starts making calls to try to track the missing Ganga down, but Arjun goes looking for her and finds her crying at a train station with her clothes torn. He tries to persuade her to go back to Kishorilal's home, but she refuses. Arjun promises to protect her and help her get back to her family in India. Just after they arrive at her home in India, Kishorilal calls Ganga's father Suraj. Believing Arjun eloped with his daughter, Suraj tries to kill him with a family sword that hangs on the wall. Arjun seizes the sword and swears to Ganga's faithfulness and chastity. Then Arjun leaves, intending never to return. Meanwhile, Suraj locks Ganga in a shed, breathing threats of murder. Ganga's siblings and grandmother sneak in and advise her to run away with Arjun. Ganga realises that she is in love with Arjun, and with their help, secretly leaves the home. By this time, Kishorilal has arrived in India with Rajiv. Ganga catches up with Arjun at a temple, and demands he confess his love. Still loyal to Kishorilal, he refuses, insisting that he does not love her. Ganga is devastated, but before he walks away, Rajiv turns up with several thugs to kill Arjun but Ganga protects Arjun. She's then confronted by Rajiv for this. In the ensuing fight, Arjun takes a terrible beating before getting the upper hand. Kishorilal arrives with Suraj just as Arjun is about to kill Rajiv. Kishorilal furiously suggests that Arjun \"honorably\" kill himself with a conveniently handy gun, and demands Arjun \"tell the truth\" about how he came to be in India with Rajiv's promised bride. This leads to the second key monologue of the film. Arjun confronts Kishorilal with not wanting to know the truth; people who want the truth, don't ask for it with a gun. He accuses Kishorilal of having become a true Westerner after all, since his wealth has eviscerated his compassion and ability to examine the truth when it doesn't match what he wants it to be. Confessing that he does, in truth, love Ganga, he affirms that he never pursued her and has acted honourably, while Rajiv in every way rejected honourable action and lied about how Ganga came to have returned so suddenly to India; not only was Ganga (personification of the most valued aspects of Indian culture), unable to merge with Western culture, Western values (in the person of Rajiv) almost utterly ruined Ganga. Ganga confirms Rajiv's attempted rape, which shocks everyone, then tells her father she is willing to die by whatever means he chooses; poison, fire, or hunger. This pivotal scene both verbalises and symbolises how good, happy, pure Ganga (Indian values), instead of being able to uplift and enrich Rajiv (Western values), has been sacrificed to the unsuccessful attempt to merge India with the West. Ironically, it also highlights one way in which Western culture can be viewed as more just and compassionate than Indian culture, since a Western bride can break off an unsuitable engagement without risking death at the hands of outraged family members. Moreover, but realising he has indeed heard the truth, Kishorilal affirms that Ganga will marry his son. Rejecting Rajiv (and, symbolically, his own Western compromises), he embraces Arjun as his true son, and along with raj and his family blesses the engagement between Arjun and Ganga. The soundtrack was composed by the duo of Nadeem Shravan while the lyrics can be credited to Anand Bakshi. It was released under the label of Tips Music Films. The album was very successful amongst the audience. The tracks \"Do Dil Mil Rahe Hai\", \"I Love My India\", \"Meri Mehbooba\", \"Yeh Dil Dewaana\" , \"Jahan Piya\" were immensely popular with songs being played till date. Music director duo Nadeem-Shravan received a Filmfare nomination for the album and won a Star Screen Award for Best Music Director. Ghai wanted A.R.Rahman to compose the music of this film but Rahman politely declined the offer since Ghai wanted the tunes ready in less than two months. Track list Pardes grossed \u20b934.83 crore (US$5.4\u00a0million) in India and $1.7 million (\u20b96.12 crore) in other countries, for a worldwide total of \u20b940.95 crore (US$6.3\u00a0million), against its \u20b910 crore (US$1.5\u00a0million) budget. It had a worldwide opening weekend of \u20b93.40 crore (US$530,000), and grossed \u20b96.19 crore (US$960,000) in its first week. It is the 4th-highest-grossing film of 1997 worldwide.

Pardes received mixed reviews from critics. Praise was given to the music, however aspects of the script were criticised. India Today cites it as one of the first major Bollywood pictures to succeed in the United States. In their book, New Cosmopolitanisms: South Asians in the US, Gita Rajan and Shailja Sharma view the film as a dichotomous depiction of the good NRI versus bad NRI, with Khan depicting the good immigrant, who assists the rowdy Indian American playboy Rajiv (Apurva Agnihotri), the bad. Khan's character of Arjun is perceived as a metaphor for cosmopolitanism or Indian cultural nationalism in the wider sense, in direct contrast to Rajiv who represents wealthy Westernization and all its negative vices and connotations.",

The film was directed by Bimal Roy. This version of the film is considered by many to be the most faithful adaptation of the novella, particularly due to Meena Kumari's interpretation of the role of Lalita.   Lalita Meena Kumari is an orphaned niece of an impoverished clerk named Gurucharan Nazir Hussain. Shekhar Ashok Kumar, is son of their rich landlord neighbor. Shekhar had liking for Lalita. Gurucharan has to mortgais house to Shekhar\u2019s father in order to get one of his daughters married as he is heavily debt ridden. Shekhar\u2019s father, often chides him about his overdue loan and a day comes when, completely pressed on all sides, Gurucharan is forced to take advantage of the altruistic offer of an interest free loan made by a wealthy young man named Girin. This gives rise to an ugly misunderstanding that Lalita has been \"sold\" to Girin. What happens thereafter forms the gripping rest of this great story of perfect love. Beautiful part of this movie is dialogue and communication between Meena Kumari and Ashok Kumar. ",

        "full_text": " Parineeta (The Married Woman) is a 2005 Indian musical romantic drama film adaptation of the 1914 Bengali novella, Parineeta by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay. Directed by debutant Pradeep Sarkar, it was based upon a screenplay by the film's producer, Vidhu Vinod Chopra. The film featured Vidya Balan (In her Bollywood Debut), Saif Ali Khan and Sanjay Dutt in the lead roles. Raima Sen plays the supporting role of Lalita's chirpy cousin. Sabyasachi Chakrabarty plays the pivotal role of Shekhar's father. Diya Mirza, with a cameo appearance as Shekhar's fianc\u00e9 and Rekha, with a cameo performance of a night club (Moulin Rouge) singer, are other notable performances. Parineeta primarily revolves around the lead characters, Lalita and Shekhar. Since childhood, Shekhar and Lalita have been friends and slowly this friendship blossoms into love. A series of misunderstandings surface and they are separated with the conniving schemes of Shekhar's father. The plot deepens with the arrival of Girish, who supports Lalita's family. Eventually, Shekhar's love defies his father's greed and he seeks Lalita. The film has several notable allusions to the Indian literature and cinema. Despite the pre-release inhibitions, it received critical acclaim. It won the Filmfare Awards apart from several prominent awards. The director went on to win the National Award for Best First Film. Parineeta was showcased at prominent international film festivals.   The story takes place in Kolkata. As the credits roll, scenes from erstwhile Calcutta are displayed along with the narrator's (Amitabh Bachchan) introduction of the era. The narration focuses on the night of the marriage of Shekhar and Gayatri Tantiya, a rich industrialist's daughter. The audience is introduced to Naveen Roy as Shekhar's father while we see Shekhar grooming himself for the occasion. While he is doing so, images of Lalita calling him by his name flash through his mind. Downstairs, musical celebrations begin as Shekhar meets Vasundhara, a widow from his neighbourhood, who is thankful to her son-in-law, Girish (Sanjay Dutt), for supporting their family after the death of her husband, Gurcharan. Lalita, who is present there, playfully confronts Shekhar as to why he is being indifferent to her. Shekhar admonishes her for speaking so in spite of being married. An angry Shekhar comes back home to play a favourite tune from the past on his piano. The flashback shows a young Shekhar playing Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s tune on his piano while young Lalita and Koel are around. Lalita, with her parents having died in a car accident, lives with Gurcharan\u2019s family. Koel is her cousin whereas Charu is her neighbour. As this scene flashes across Shekhar\u2019s mind, he sings a song full of sadness and loss. As time flies, they grow up to become close friends. The rebellious and musically inclined Shekhar spends his days playing the music of Rabindranath Tagore or Elvis Presley and composing his own songs with Lalita rather than becoming part of his shrewd father's business. Part of this rebellion involves resistance to meeting Gayatri Tantiya, the beautiful but devious daughter of a wealthy industrialist, whom his father would like Shekhar to marry. Meanwhile, Girish, a steel tycoon from London, makes a dramatic entry into Charu\u2019s house. Girish seems smitten by Lalita while Koel is by Girish. Shekhar is visibly jealous of Lolita\u2019s close friendship with Girish. One day, a shocked Lalita, who is employed at the Roy\u2019s office, remembers a hotel project from Gurcharan\u2019s ancestral haveli (palatial house). On an earlier occasion, Gurcharan had borrowed money from Naveen Roy after putting his haveli on mortgage. She understands that if the money is not repaid in a few months, Naveen Roy would take over the property. She immediately thinks of asking Shekhar for monetary help. Unforeseen circumstances prevent this, and Girish, upon realising this, alleviates their problem by making Gurcharan his business partner. Gurcharan repays the debt and the turn of events prompts Shekhar to think why Lalita chose to ask Girish for money instead of him. On one auspicious night, Shekhar and Lalita exchange garlands and consummate their \"marriage\" unbeknownst to anyone else. While Shekhar is off to Darjeeling on a business trip, Naveen Roy violently thunders at Lalita about the loss of his hotel project, embarrassing and humiliating her. Roy gets a wall built between his and Gurcharan\u2019s house symbolising the end of their association. Gurcharan, unable to digest this, suffers a heart attack. Upon Shekhar\u2019s return, Roy informs him of the ill-health of his mother and Gurcharan and viciously adds a note of Lalita and Girish\u2019s marriage. Shekhar is disgusted to hear of the marriage and in his anger he scowls at Lalita, humiliating her like his father. Meanwhile, Girish assists Gurcharan's family and takes them to London for the heart treatment. Misunderstandings follow and upon the family\u2019s return from London, Shekhar assumes that Girish and Lalita are married and agrees to marry Gayatri. The film returns to the night of Shekhar\u2019s marriage when Girish hands him the ownership papers of Gurcharan\u2019s haveli. He shocks Shekhar by telling him that he got married to Koel because Lalita denied his marriage proposal. As a conclusion, Shekhar confronts his father and symbolically breaks down the wall separating the two families. He then brings Lalita to his home as his bride much to the delight of his mother. Before Parineeta, Pradeep Sarkar was a well-known personality in the area of advertisements. With 17 years in mainstream advertising and 7 years of advertisement film-making and commercial cinema, he completed about 1000 commercials and 15 music videos. Vidhu Vinod Chopra, the producer, took notice of his music videos and contacted Sarkar to direct some of the music videos of the film Mission Kashmir (2000). After carving a niche in filming music videos, Sarkar gave the thought of filming Parineeta to Chopra. There began the making of the film. About the film's comparison with the novel, Chopra said in an interview that, as compared to its 1953 namesake film by Bimal Roy, the story was based in the year 1962. He said that it took them one and a half years to script the film, with them adding new characters and emphasising under-represented characters from the novel. In a separate interview, Chopra admitted that he was actively involved with the screenplay because the film was an adaptation of the novel. When speaking about cinematic adaptation, Chopra gave due credit to Sarkar, and Natarajan Subramaniam (the film's cinematographer), for providing the vintage visuals. Saif Ali Khan once said that the film was initially attempted to be made in a contemporary way. When the film's crew did not find the depiction appealing, the filming began with the 60s look. Chopra once cited an interesting anecdote about his belief in Sarkar's film-making abilities. He said that he never personally signed the cheques for the film's expenditure. He transferred money into Sarkar's bank account and the cheques were eventually signed by Sarkar and his spouse. Chopra said in an interview that Saif Ali Khan and Vidya Balan were not the first choices for the lead roles in Parineeta. In fact Abhishek Bachchan was being cast as Shekhar and Saif Ali Khan as Girish. However Abhishek walked out of the project and Saif readily was accepted as a replacement. This fact was corroborated by Saif in an interview when he said that even though Sarkar had faith in his abilities, Chopra was not too keen on having him. The choice of Vidya Balan came with Sarkar's prior work experience with her in three music videos. Chopra said that Vidya was screen-tested for six months and only then they were sure of her acting abilities. Saif once said that he was not convinced of Vidya's abilities, since Parineeta was to be her first film. He instead hoped to work with established actresses like Aishwarya Rai or Rani Mukherjee. However, after seeing Vidya portray the character of Lalita, he was thoroughly appreciative of her performance. Getting an opportunity to debut with big names from the industry along with a lovely character to portray made Vidya accept the role of Lalita. The choice of Sanjay Dutt was because of his versatility, said Chopra in an interview. He also said that the affable nature of Sanjay was a plus during film making. Diya Mirza liked the script so well that she chose to play the role of the devious Gayatri in spite of it being a short role. Raima Sen had a similar story with her want to work with the duo of Chopra and Sarkar. The cameo of the veteran actress, Rekha was purely out of her interest in the song, \"Kaisi Paheli Zindgani\". Since Sarkar knew the city of Kolkata very well, the film was primarily shot there. While most of the film was made in Kolkata, a small portion was shot in Darjeeling. To re-create the 60s era, lot of efforts were made by the producers. For instance, Chopra said that it cost them money and difficulty to procure the green coloured car which was driven by Shekhar in the film. Chopra confirmed the authenticity of the piano used in the song \"Piyu Bole\", and of the toy train used in the song \"Kasto Mazza\". About the look of the characters, Mirza said that the 60s look was well captured by the make-up artist, Vidyadar. The song \"Kaisi Paheli Zindagani\" was based on the tune to Louis Armstrong's \"A Kiss to Build a Dream on\". Critics had high expectations from Parineeta's music because of the award-winning music that was provided in some of Chopra's previous films, such as (1942: A Love Story (1993) and Mission Kashmir (2000)). Shantanu Moitra, Parineeta's music director composed hundreds of tunes before six of them got finalised after a year's effort. After finalising the soundtrack, Chopra was appreciative of the musician's abilities when he said that Moitra has the potential to become another R. D. Burman, a yesteryear Bollywood music director. Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, the author of Parineeta, was a contemporary of Rabindranath Tagore; both authors documented Bengali life and social issues at the turn of the century. The 2005 cinematic version of Parineeta pays homage to this relationship by referencing Satyajit Ray's film Charulata, which itself is based upon Tagore's noted novella, Nashtanir. Lalita (Parineeta) is dressed to resemble Nashtanir / Charulata 's Charu (Madhabi Mukherjee), particularly during the song \"Soona Man Ka Aangan\", which incorporates Tagore's song \"Phoole Phoole Dhole Dhole.\" In both Parineeta and Charulata, \"Phoole Phoole Dhole Dhole\" is sung while Lalita and Charu are each on a swing. The film continues the above connection by placing Saif Ali Khan on the same train used in the film Aradhana which featured his mother, Sharmila Tagore. This film was the third one to bear resemblance to the novella, the other two being its 1953 namesake film and the 1976 film, Sankoch. Parineeta notched up Rs. 506 million in India at the end of 2005. Its overseas success was notable as well with gross collections of Rs. 36 million in the United Kingdom, Rs. 35 million in North America, and Rs 15 million in the rest of the overseas. Before its release on 10 June 2005, one preview wondered how the film would fare at the box office. Citing comparisons with the 1953 version, the preview suggested that debutant director, Sarkar's inexperience in film-making, the probable inability of debutant actress, Balan to portray Lalita's character appropriately, suitable 1960s depiction by contemporary actors and musician, Shantanu Moitra's until then unimpressive soundtracks, could be impediments to a successful adaptation. Post-release, the same critic said \"Vidhu Vinod Chopra's \"Parineeta\" \u2013 a remake of an old classic of the same name...(had) the love story (which) was received well by the younger generation and it went on to become the biggest hit of the year.\" It was generally well-received by the critics, with one of them terming the film as \"...a beautiful story, beautifully told. It approximates what most of us expect, and increasingly yearn for, in vain, our cinematic experience.\" A reviewer from About.com said that it is \"contemporary retelling of...(an) engaging and timeless tale rich with human emotion and universal drama\". The reviewer appreciates the film in most of the nuances of film making saying that this is \"enhanced by a brilliant musical score, and accentuated by superb performances by Sanjay Dutt, Saif Ali Khan, Raima Sen, Diya Mirza and debutante Vidya Balan in the lead role of Lalita\". 3000 copies of the novella were sold within weeks of the film's release, owing to the film's good reception. Derek Elley from Variety said \"A character-driven meller that's a treat for the eyes, with performances to match, \"Parineeta\" is high-end Bollywood near its best\". He also says that, \"though the climax is still emotionally powerful, it comes over as overcooked.\" A mixed review from Mid-Day says \"Pradeep Sarkar weaves the story like magic, especially in the first half\u00a0... excelling in the detailing\u00a0... the vintage look of the film (that stood out) with authentic costumes, props and the roads of Kolkata\". However, the review criticised the film's climax terming it as amateur, thereby diluting the whole film's impact. Another such review came from The Hindu which begins by saying \"A simple enough story, but Sarkar tells it well, with some great shots of Shekhar and Lalita together.\" The review eventually says \"Except for the end\u00a0... where it is too much to bear.\" The issue of piracy cropped up when a news article published in The Indian Express exposed the dark side of the film market. Hardly into weeks of the film's release, CDs were being sold at as low as Rs. 40. Another blemish was that Soumitra Dasgupta, a writer and close associate of Sarkar alleged that the film's story had a striking resemblance to his parallel work on the novella. In 2005, Parineeta's cast got a red carpet walk when it was the \"World Premiere Film\" at the International Indian Film Awards (IIFA) weekend in Amsterdam. Owing to this European premiere, Sarkar said that the film had a great opening in the American and English box-offices. The film was on the UK Top Ten films for four consecutive weeks. The film was chosen among 15 debut works for the 2006 Berlin Film Festival. It received enthusiastic reception from the audience as it ran to packed houses to the Chopra's surprise. Expecting an audience of about 100 Westerners, a critic visiting the festival was surprised to see the cinema hall full and people jostling for seats even on the steps. At the 24th Annual Minneapolis-St. Paul International Film Festival held in April 2006, Parineeta was the only Indian mainstream cinema to feature among 135 films from 40 countries. In 2006, the film featured in the Palm Springs International Film Festival, 24th San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival, Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles, Helsinki Film Festival and the International Film Festival of Marrakech. Apart from winning the National Award for the Best First Film Director, Parineeta won five Filmfare Awards. Best Art Direction to Keshto Mondal, Tanushree Sarkar and Pradeep Sarkar, Best Choreography to Howard Rosemayer, Best Debut to Vidya Balan, RD Burman Award to Shantanu Moitra and Best Sound Recording to Bishwadeep Chatterjee. It was also nominated for an additional nine awards, for the categories Best Film and Best Director, three for actors portraying Lalita, Shekhar and Girish and four nominations for the soundtrack. The film also won a prominent awards in the form of two Star Screen Awards, three Zee Cine Awards among a notable awards. Apart from these, the film was nominated for an eclectic mix of awards. 2006 Filmfare Awards 2006 Zee Cine Awards 2006 Screen Awards 2006 IIFA Awards The first version of the DVD version of Parineeta was released by UTV Motion Pictures on 30 October 2006. It has subtitle options in English, Arabic, Spanish, German, Italian, Malay, and French. An additional disc includes interviews with the actors and a behind the scenes look at the making of the film. It is available in 16:9 Anamorphic widescreen, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, progressive 24 FPS, widescreen and NTSC format. The soundtrack to Parineeta was released by Tips Music in April 2005 to positive reviews.",

        "full_text": " Pati Patni Aur Woh (English: The Husband, Wife And Mistress) is a 1978 Hindi movie produced and directed by B. R. Chopra. The film stars Sanjeev Kumar, Vidya Sinha, Ranjeeta Kaur, and in guest appearances Rishi Kapoor, Neetu Singh and Parveen Babi.   The film is a comical take on extra-marital affairs. Ranjeet Chaddha (Sanjeev Kumar) & Sharda (Vidya Sinha) meet, fall in love & get married. Eventually, Ranjeet gets a promotion, a higher salary & a temptation - Nirmala Deshpande (Ranjeeta Kaur), his new secretary. Ranjeet lies to Nirmala\u2014to get her sympathy\u2014that his wife is terminally ill. Nirmala feels sorry for Ranjeet and gets close to him. Ranjeet uses this to further his plans. But when everything is going as planned, Sharda gets suspicious. She spies on them & learns the truth. When Ranjeet gets busted in front of both the women, the proverbial hell breaks loose. The film starts off indicating the parallels of the story with that of Adam & Eve. Here, Adam is Ranjeet, Eve is Sharda while the apple is Nirmala. Ranjeet is newly employed in a company, whose pay scales can be gauged from the fact that he goes to work on a bicycle. However, this bicycle itself brings him face-to-face with Sharda, when he bumps into her by accident. Sharda's bicycle gets badly damaged & Ranjeet drops her off. The same evening, Ranjeet goes to the wedding of his friend Abdul Karim Durrani (Asrani), a co-worker & a poet. Sharda is also present at the ceremony. Sharda & Ranjeet's love blossoms from there & soon they get married. In the course of a few years, Ranjeet is Sales Manager of the company and father of a son. Sharda & Ranjeet are still living in marital bliss. That is, until Nirmala, Ranjeet's new secretary, shows up. Ranjeet is inexplicably attracted to Nirmala. She is an honest girl who is trying to make two ends meet. She is much more beautiful compared to Sharda. But most of all, she knows nothing about Ranjeet's true intentions & his married life. Ranjeet is initially upset with his thoughts about her, but finally gives in. He carefully plans his further steps. He pretends to be the helpless grieving husband of a cancer stricken wife, who won't live much longer. Nirmala feels sorry for him, thus making it easier for him to get close to her. Nobody, not Sharda, not even his closest friend, suspects a thing. One day, Ranjeet bluffs to Sharda that he will be late coming home as he has a meeting. He takes Nirmala out to dinner. Next day, Sharda finds Nirmala's handkerchief, with lipstick marks on it, in Ranjeet's pocket. She immediately confronts Ranjeet, who makes up a story about a co-worker whose handkerchief he may have accidentally taken. Sharda reluctantly believes him. Ranjeet decides to take his next steps more carefully. Sharda too starts thinking that her fears were unfounded. Ranjeet makes even more interesting back up plans: He prepares two books of poetry, professing his love. The poems are the same in both, only one book contains Nirmala's name, and the other contains Sharda's. Ranjeet courts Nirmala without Sharda's knowledge. The turning point comes when Sharda sees him in a hotel with Nirmala. She later asks him about his meeting, about which the clueless Ranjeet lies. Sharda's fears are confirmed. She starts spying on him & Nirmala, taking incriminating pictures. After sufficient evidence is obtained, she secretly meets Nirmala, posing as a journalist. Nirmala, who hasn't seen Ranjeet's \"ailing wife\" yet, thinks Sharda intends to blackmail her. But Sharda reassures her that she won't. Nirmala spills all the beans, upon which Sharda reveals her true identity. Meanwhile, Ranjeet gets another promotion & rushes home happily to tell his wife about it. Sharda catches him unawares and lets him know that he is busted. Ranjeet does not know what has hit him. He turns round, only to see Nirmala behind him. Sharda tells him that she is leaving him & the divorce papers will be soon sent to him. Sharda & Nirmala console each other. Ranjeet calls upon his friend & lies that Nirmala has said some malicious lies to Sharda about him. Ranjeet's friend sides with him & lies about Nirmala's character. Sharda exposes Ranjeet in front of him as well, with help of the evidence she has collected. Sharda tells Ranjeet to choose either her or Nirmala. Ranjeet quietly gives Nirmala some money & lies to her, in a last-ditch attempt at damage control. But honest Nirmala returns the money to Sharda, making things even worse for Ranjeet. Sharda prepares to walk out on Ranjeet, while Nirmala resigns and leaves Ranjeet as well. Sharda comes to visit Ranjeet one last time, when their innocent son asks what is happening. Sharda decides to give Ranjeet another chance, if only for their son and soon life comes back on track. But soon another secretary(Parveen Babi) joins the office & Ranjeet tries to resort to his antics once more. Just by coincidence, Ranjeet's friend suddenly walks in & Ranjeet backs off, taking this as a warning. All lyrics written by Anand Bakshi; all music composed by Ravindra Jain.",

        "full_text": " Peepli Live is a 2010 Indian satirical comedy film that explores the topic of \"farmer suicides\" and the subsequent media and political response. It is written and directed by Anusha Rizvi in her directorial debut, and produced by Aamir Khan Productions. The film stars Naya Theatre company member Omkar Das Manikpuri as well as Naseeruddin Shah, Raghubir Yadav, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Shalini Vatsa and Malaika Shenoy along with a number of newcomers. Peepli Live, distributed by UTV Motion Pictures, was released on 13 August 2010. Peepli Live was India's official entry for the 83rd Academy Awards Best Foreign Film category although it was not nominated.   Natha Das ManikPuri (Omkar Das Manikpuri), better known as Natha, is a poor farmer from the village of Peepli in \"Mukhya Pradesh\", who struggles to farm enough money for his family made up of his elder brother, Budhia Das Manikpuri (Raghubir Yadav), his wife, Dhaniya (Shalini Vatsa) and his ailing mother, Amma (Farookh Zafar), who spends most of her time lying down and screaming at Natha and Dhaniya. Natha and Budhia often pretend to go out farming when actually they save up whatever money they have to buy alcohol. This has left the whole family famished and now the banks are demanding repayment of loans or else the family will be stripped off their land and house. In the meantime, the Mukhya Pradesh Government have called a by-election due to continuous criticism of their blind eye towards the desperate poverty that surrounds India's largest state. The opposition Apna Dal Party believe they have a chance to form the government in this election as the people have lost faith in the long-serving Sammaan Party and its Chief Minister, Ram Babu Yadav (Jugal Kishore) who, along with Federal Agriculture Minister, Saleem Kidwai (Naseeruddin Shah), believes in the industrialisation of rural areas. To save his land and to save his family from becoming homeless, Natha, encouraged by his brother, decides to commit suicide after he attends a session with the rural headmen for help and they suggest him that committing suicide is a good way to get money waived, after which his family will receive heavy compensation for his death. While Natha and his brother are discussing the same at a local tea stall, this news gets reported by Rakesh, a local reporter from Peepli. This report then gets picked up and highlighted by the national English news channels and reaches the Chief Minister. The media starts surrounding Peepli sensing the possibility of a sensational suicide story. One ITVN journalist particularly keen on filming the event of Natha's death is Daytime Presenter, Nandita Malik (Malaika Shenoy). She joins the local reporter Rakesh Kapoor (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) and takes desperate measures to interview Natha and his family on the subject of Natha's suicide. However things get more tricky when rival Hindi news channel, \"Bharat Live\" finds out about Natha and Peepli. The news channel clashes with ITVN and each try to film Natha's death in their own manner. The Sammaan Party also soon discover Natha's plans and try to buy off Natha with sops to prevent him from committing suicide. Opposition parties like the Apna Dal and the CPI also get involved and plan to use Natha as a path to power in the elections. Peepli soon becomes the centre of attention across Mukhya Pradesh. Nandita's frantic attempts to interview Natha get worse when Rakesh does not find Natha or anyone else in Peepli to interview. She seems unimpressed with Rakesh's compassionate stand towards Natha and believes that as reporters their duty lies in reporting and following the news and nothing else. On the other hand, \"Bharat Live\" continues to be successful in their attempts to interview. Yet as time goes on, Natha does not die. Meanwhile, the Sammaan Party realise that if Natha commits suicide, they will lose the elections. The rural headmen secretly kidnap Natha and hold to ransom for money from the opposition. Yet their plans are foiled when Rakesh discovers Deepak and his men holding Natha hostage at a Peepli barn. A rush occurs when people from Apna Dal, the CPI, ITVN, Bharat Live and Peepli villagers all rush to find Natha. In the confusion, a spillage accident from a Petromax lamp sets fire to the barn, which explodes and Rakesh is killed. The Government officials mistake Rakesh for Natha and refuse to pay Natha's family the compensation money due to the death being an accident. Meanwhile, Natha is in fact alive and flees to Gurgaon and is seen working as a daily labourer in the construction industry. His family loses their land to the bank. Peepli Live began as a script written by NDTV journalist Anusha Rizvi called The Fallen. In 2004 Rizvi asked Aamir Khan to read her script and, although he initially refused as he was preoccupied with shooting Mangal Pandey: The Rising, he eventually decided to finance the film after she described the plot to him. In an interview, Khan explains the meaning of the movie title: \"When we were looking for the right title before we began the publicity and promotions of the film, we came up with Peepli Live. Peepli is the village that film is set in, the \"live\" part is meant to indicate: here is a story that is happening in Peepli that the filmmaker is bringing to you live. That's why it's Peepli Live.\" Peepli Live was filmed on various locations in Madhya Pradesh such as Bhopal, Indore, Tikamgarh, Khurai as well as in New Delhi. Maxima Basu designed the costumes aptly capturing the rural essence of the film. According to Aamir Khan, many of the actors are Adivasis from the sub-urban area of Bhopal, Bhadwai in Madhya Pradesh. Other cast members are from playwright Habib Tanvir's theatre troupe Naya Theatre. Peepli Live competed in the Sundance Film Festival, the first film from India to achieve this feat. With support of media billionaire Keyur Patel of Fuse Global who is major hollywood financier \"Peepli Live\" was selected at Sundance Film Festival and his relationship with Robert Redford provided a great platform there. It received an 'A' adult certificate in India for language use. The movie was picked up by speciality German distribution company Rapid Eye Movies for a special screening at the Berlin International Film Festival. It was also named the Best First Feature Film at the 31st Durban International Film Festival in South Africa. In the United Kingdom, the film was released on 24 September. Peepli Live reportedly recovered its cost before its release itself. Peepli Live received positive reviews. Subhash K. Jha, film critic and author of The Essential Guide to Bollywood, describes Peepli Live as \"a work of damning ramifications.\" He further states that, \"To most of us out here sitting in the auditorium, farmers' suicide is just a headline. Read, regretted and then put to bed. Peeply (Live) is that savagely raw and hurtful wake-up call for the conscience which does not mince words.\" Nikhat Kazmi of the Times of India gave the film three and a half out of five stars stating,\" How smart can Indian cinema get? Exhilarating answer: Very smart. And that's the bottomline of Peepli Live, a small little film, that showcases the real India without glossing over the contradictions of our fumbling-bumbling democracy or getting overtly sentimental about garibi and the attendant grime that goes with it. Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph wrote \"Peepli Live demands to be absorbed and not just watched over the weekend\" and praised the director Anusha Rizvi \u2013 \"she has the gift of the dark humour satire ala Shyam Benegal and in her uncompromised shooting style, she shows the fire of Mira Nair\". Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave it four and a half out of five stars and argues that \"the concept [farmers' suicides] would instinctively translate into a serious, thought-provoking film. But Peepli [Live] takes a grim and solemn issue, turns it into a satire, garnishes it with populist sentiment and makes a far greater impact than a mere documentary, had it tackled the burning issue. In fact, like all Aamir Khan films, Peepli [Live] marries realism with a winning box-office formula most brilliantly.\" Mayank Shekhar of The Hindustan Times gave the film four out of five stars arguing that \"the satire is irresistible; the subtext, compelling. And yet neither shows itself up in any form of self-seriousness. The comic writing is immaculately inspired\". Noyon Jyoti Parasara of Yahoo gave the film 3.5 out of five and said, \"Peepli [Live] is a class act and director Anusha Rizvi and producer Aamir Khan could take a bow for working this into reality\". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN also gave it three and a half out of five stars, calling it \"a scathing satire on the country's apathy towards the rural class, and specifically towards farmers, Peepli Live employs a comic tone to tell a serious story. The witty script turns Natha into something of a local celebrity, who draws out the true character and motivations of all those who cross his path.\" Mathures Paul of The Statesman gave the film 4 out of 5 stars noting that, \"Anusha Rizvi demolishes successfully whatever little faith we had in the political process. Peepli (Live) is entertaining and inspiring\". As of 2 October 2010, Peepli Live has received a rating of 83% from critics (19 fresh and 4 rotten reviews) at Rotten Tomatoes. On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 69 out of 100, based on 12 reviews, indicating \"Generally Favorable\" reviews. According to Box Office India, Peepli Live took a good start and did a business of \u20b940 million (US$620,000) on its first day. The film collected \u20b9299.1 million (US$4.6\u00a0million) by the end of its third week and was declared a super hit. Overseas, the film opened to a limited release at 64 places in the U.S, and was ranked third, grossing $350,054 in the domestic market and $700,000 worldwide in its opening weekend. The music is composed by Indian Ocean, an Indian band and Ram Sampath. Peepli Live is the subject of a few controversies. VJAS (Vidarbha Janandolan Samiti), the Nagpur-based farmer's advocacy group, asked the Maharashtra government to ban the film due to its depiction of farmer suicides.Kishor Tiwari, the president of VJAS, stated: \"TV serial 'Bairi Piya' has shown that debt-trapped Vidarbha farmers are selling daughters to clear their debt, while 'Peepli Live' is far from reality and an insult to poor farmers of Vidarbha who have been victims of globalization and wrong policies of the state.\"  In addition, according to the Hindustan Times, \"folk singer Rama Joshi alleges that a song Chola Mati Ke Ram, which has been used in the film, does not give credit to Gangaram Siwar, a celebrated folk singer of Chhattisgarh and the original lyricist of the folk song.\" In response, Nageen Tanwir, who sang the song in the film, stated: \"The song, Chola Maati Ke Ram, has been composed by Gangaram Siwar in Chhattisgarh, but the Habib Tanvir theatre group has officially purchased rights for the song. So I don't understand why people from Chhattisgarh are asking for their due again.\"  Also, according to John Travolta, Peepli Live was inspired by 1997 English film Mad City. In an interview with The Hindu, he stated that he was astonished to learn that India's official entry for the Oscars this year, Peepli Live, was inspired by Mad City, his best film as an actor. The film's storyline also shares similarity to Malayalam film Pakal. Its director M. A. Nishad says: \"The storyline of the Bollywood movie Peepli Live has a similar theme to Pakal, which was released much before the Hindi film. The difference was in the narrative style.\" The song \"Mehngai dayan khaye jat hai\" was challenged in court by the Congress party alleging that Sonia Gandhi was called as \"Dayan\" (female ghost) in the movie. However, the argument did not sustain and the case was dismissed by the court holding that Sonia Gandhi was not responsible for the rising inflation in India.",

To prevent Sohni's arranged marriage with Harbanslal, Ram decides to rob the pawn broker. But he is caught in the act, and he murders the pawn owner. Ram's conscience keeps telling him to admit his crime. But he never picks up the courage to do so. The police inspector on the case keeps suspecting Ram for the crime. With no proof he, too, is helpless. Ram learns that police have already arrested another thief and have charged him with this robbery and murder. On the last day when the court is to rule in the case, Raj makes up his mind and admits. He pleads saying how he was acting in self-defense against real villains of the society. The court sentences him for three years of imprisonment. Sohni promises that she will wait for his release and then marry him. Lyrics for this socially relevant film were composed by Sahir Ludhianvi and music by Mohammed Zahur Khayyam, popularly known as Khayyam. The song \"Chin-O-Arab Hamara, Hindustan Hamara, Rahne Ko Ghar Nahin Hain, Saara Jahan Hamara\" sung by Mukesh and picturised on Raj Kapoor, became very popular yet controversial and was very close to being banned then.[citation needed] Phir Subah Hogi fared successfully at the box office and was the fourth highest-grossing film of the year 1958 behind Madhumati, Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi and Yahudi. The music composed by Khayyam is considered as \"rich and beautiful\". Songs like \"Chin-O-Arab Hamara\" and \"Woh Subah Kabhi To Aayegi\" penned by Sahir Ludhianvi were satirical on the condition of India and the Nehruvian politics. \"Chin-o-Arab Hamara\" was a parody on Iqbal's song \"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\". Lal Krishna Advani, a senior leader of \"Bhartiya Janata Party\", many a time in his speeches has talked about watching this movie along with his friend and colleague Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Advani reminisces that former prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee was very fond of watching movies. He narrated an incident where in the 1958 he and Vajpayee, after facing an electoral defeat in Delhi Municipal Corporation election, straightaway went to watch a movie. Advani says that the film turned out to be 'Phir Subah Hogi'. Advani says that after Vajpayee became PM, he told party workers that the title of the movie had turned out to be prophetic and there was finally dawn.",

It tells the story of the short-tempered Piku Banerjee (Padukone), her grumpy, ageing father Bhashkor (Bachchan) and Rana Chaudhary (Khan), who is stuck between the father-daughter duo, as they embark on a journey from Delhi to Kolkata. The story and screenplay was written by Juhi Chaturvedi. Principal photography began in August 2014 and was wrapped up in December. Anupam Roy composed the soundtrack and score, and wrote the lyrics. Piku was released on 8 May 2015. It garnered wide critical acclaim upon release. Critics praised the screenplay, performances, humour and overall simplicity. It also emerged as a commercial success worldwide. Made on a budget of \u20b9420 million (US$6.5\u00a0million), Piku earned \u20b91.41 billion (US$22\u00a0million) worldwide. On January 11, 2016, the film was nominated for Best Film in the 61st Filmfare Awards, as well as other categories. Padukone won her second Filmfare Award for Best Actress, and Bachchan received his fourth National Film Award for Best Actor at the 63rd National Film Awards and his third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for his performance.   Piku Banerjee (Deepika Padukone) is a Bengali architect residing in Delhi, with her 70-year-old father, Bhashkor (Amitabh Bachchan). Bhashkor has problems with chronic constipation and traces every problem to his bowel movements. His habits often lead to quarrels with the servants and irritates Chhobi Mashi (Moushumi Chatterjee), who often visits them. Piku loves her father and, as her mother has died, takes good care of him but gets extremely irritated with him at times because of his eccentricities. Her colleague, Syed Afroz (Jisshu Sengupta) is a good friend, and she is a regular client of Syed's friend, Rana Chaudhary's (Irrfan Khan) taxi business. Rana has his own family problems with his mother and sister. Piku wants to sell their ancestral home in Kolkata, Champakunj, but Bhashkor objects vehemently and decides to go to Kolkata. Piku has to accompany him, since she cannot let him travel alone. Bhashkor brings up his constipation problem and decides to travel by road. Due to Piku being very problematic with other drivers of Rana, they back away before Piku's trip. Piku, disappointed with the agency tries to book a flight, but soon, Rana arrives at their home to take the family to Kolkata himself, without informing his family about the trip. On the way, the group encounters many incidents, including Rana on the verge of losing patience due to Bhashkor's fussy behaviour and constipation. They finally reach Kolkata, where Piku's relatives live in the old house and Bhashkor asks Rana to stay for some time. Piku and Rana go out in the city and gradually grow close. Rana also subtly hints not to sell the house during a discussion. Rana leaves Kolkata the next day and asks Bhashkor to stop his eccentricities which he eventually listens to. Piku changes her mind and decides not to sell the house. Meanwhile, Bhashkor's sudden desire to bicycle increases as he cycles through a part of the city alone, leaving everyone tense since he did not tell them about it. When Bhashkor returns, Piku berates him for eating street food and for being irresponsible, but he simply states that his constipation is cleared and he needs to bicycle every day. He remembers Rana who had told him to eat everything and not be choosy and picky about food. Piku is secretly happy but does not emote much. The next day, everyone discovers that Bhashkor has died in his sleep, probably from sleep apnea or cardiac arrhythmia. Piku states that he always wanted a peaceful death. She returns to Delhi, where she arranges his funeral. There, Dr. Srivastava (Raghubir Yadav), Bhashkor\u2019s doctor, reveals to her that Syed, too, has constipation and Bhashkor knew about it for a long time. A few days later, she pays up whatever due she owes Rana. She renames the Delhi house \"Bhaskor Villa\" in her father\u2019s memory and the maid, who had left due to Bhashkor\u2019s tantrums, returns to work.

In a 4 out of 5 star review, The Times of India praised the writing, direction and performances. Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph India gave an average of 7/10, saying \"Don\u2019t go in with a lot of laugh-out-loud expectations and you will enjoy Piku for what it is \u2013\u2013 a simple, slice-of-life bittersweet tale about a family fighting constipation\". Gayatri Sankar of Zee News gave 4 out of 5 stars and wrote \"In totality, Piku is a wonderful family film, which will certainly make you wear a broad smile.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and said \"On the whole, Piku is a must watch this season as it brings back the memories of the legendary directors Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Basu Chatterjee and likes\". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 4 stars out of five and said \"Piku, directed by Shoojit Sircar, is a charming, unpredictable comedy that \u2013 like Sircar\"s Vicky Donor \u2013 mines humor from the unlikeliest of places\". Anuj Kumar of The Hindu gave it a positive review, saying \"A slice of life that deals with the practical difficulties in loving your aging parents in a light-hearted, feel good way, Piku is a progressive piece of cinema that brings the parent back into the picture\".

Namrata Joshi of Outlook gave 3 out of 5 stars, and wrote \"Piku goes into an atypical zone for a Hindi mainstream film. It breaks the plot-driven, high on drama rule and yet manages to forge a big connect with the audience; The slice-of-life film has characters, relationships and interactions that feel real and evoke empathy in viewers\u2014be they aging parents or their caregivers\". On the contrary, Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave 2.5 out of 5, saying \"Piku sparks in moments, and I threw my head back and guffawed in a few. But the rest of it stays only mildly amusing. I wanted more motion in these motions\". Rachel Saltz of The New York Times wrote \"Piku, directed by Shoojit Sircar from a script by Juhi Chaturvedi, isn't a typical Hindi movie. It lopes along, following no formula beyond the roughest outlines of a romantic comedy.\"  Piku grossed \u20b950 million (US$770,000) in India on its opening day. On Saturday, the film earned \u20b985 million (US$1.3\u00a0million), showing a growth of 65%.

It stars Amitabh Bachchan, Taapsee Pannu, Kirti Kulhari, Angad Bedi, Andrea Tariang, Piyush Mishra, and Dhritiman Chatterjee. It was released on 16 September 2016. The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) granted the film a U/A certificate with four verbal cuts. The film was appreciated by both the audience and the critics, and garnered the National Film Award for Best Film on Other Social Issues.  The film was specially screened for the Rajasthan Police so as to train them to be sensitive and sensible about women's rights and dignity. The film was also specially screened at Rashtrapati Bhavan  and invited for a screening at the United Nations headquarters in New York City. On 4 November 2016 the movie completed a 50-day run in theatres.   Raunak Anand a.k.a. Dumpy (Raashul Tandon) and Vishwajyoti Ghosh a.k.a Vishwa (Tushar Pandey) rush their friend, Rajveer Singh (Angad Bedi) to the hospital. He is profusely bleeding from an injury to his head. They nervously refrain from filing a police complaint. Elsewhere three young women \u2014 Minal Arora (Taapsee Pannu), Falak Ali (Kirti Kulhari) and Andrea Tariang (Andrea Tariang) \u2014 hurriedly travel in a taxi to their apartment. They look disoriented, and it is implied that they have something to do with the incident. Minal and her friends are shaken but try to carry on with their normal life. They are independent and self-sufficient women living together in South Delhi. Minal goes out for her morning run, where she sees an old man staring at her. He turns out to be Deepak Sehgal (Amitabh Bachchan), their neighbor. Eventually a series of threats arise from Rajveer\u2019s friend Ankit Malhotra (Vijay Verma), who pushes for revenge. The threats result in Andrea being stalked and Falak losing her job. They are discouraged by a police officer from filing a complaint stating it would make their daily lives miserable. In reality the local police are aware that the young men are \"well connected\" and are backed-up by Rajveer\u2019s uncle who is a powerful politician from South Delhi. Nevertheless, Minal files a complaint. Minal is kidnapped by Rajveer\u2019s friends during her morning run. Deepak witnesses the incident but is unable to help. Minal is molested in the moving car and dropped back at night after being warned to drop the charges. A few days later, Minal is arrested by police from her apartment, based on a complaint from Rajveer labeling the women as prostitutes and charging Minal with attempted murder. Deepak visits Falak and Andrea at their apartment and helps them with the bail procedures. It turns out that Deepak was a reputable lawyer who retired after a decline in his mental health, and also to take care of his ailing wife Sara (Mamta Shankar). He comes out of retirement to help the women. In the courtroom, Rajveer\u2019s lawyer, Prashant Mehra (Piyush Mishra), presents the following version of events: Rajveer and his friends meet with Minal and her friends at a rock concert. The men invite the women for dinner at a hotel resort, where they have drinks. The women provoke the men and demand money, all signs indicating that they are prostitutes. Rajveer refuses to pay and an enraged Minal hits him on the head with a bottle and flees. Prashant\u2019s argument focuses on the poor moral character of the women. He pushes the idea that the friendly manner of the women, the fact that they attended a rock concert and the fact that they had drinks with the men indicate that they were prostitutes. Prashant attacks the fact that Minal has family in Delhi but chooses to live alone, Falak is in a relationship with an older man, and Andrea has moved to the city from the North East of India. Contrary to this, Minal and her friends state that the men tried to sexually assault them. Minal alleges that Rajveer tried to rape her, and she attacked him with the bottle in self-defense. Deepak\u2019s argument focuses on the issue of consent and a woman\u2019s right to say no. A series of interesting and chilling courtroom arguments ensues in the following days. Towards the end of the trial, Rajveer becomes enraged and provoked by Deepak, revealing the truth by stating that the women \u201cgot what they deserved\u201d. Deepak criticizes the regressed views of the society where women are stereotyped as prostitutes if they come home late, move out of their home, want to be independent, drink and so on, but none of these apply to men. In his closing remarks, Deepak mentions that his client said \u201cno\u201d. No means no and doesn\u2019t require further explanation. The court rules in favor of the women, acquitting them. Rajveer, Ankit, and Dumpy are charged, with the final verdict of their punishment pending. The closing credits shows what happened at the resort, with the events leading up to Minal\u2019s attack on Rajveer. In early March 2016 Amitabh Bachchan revealed that he was shooting a film in Delhi. It was rumoured that the film was titled \"Eve\". On 13 March Bachchan denied the rumours and announced through Twitter that the film is titled Pink. Director-producer Shoojit Sircar informed that Amitabh Bachchan accepted the role and Tapsee Pannu was their first choice. Andrea Tariang was also selected to play the role of one of the girls in the film. Tushar Pandey, Raashul Tandon and Arjun Chakraborty are making their debut with this film. The shooting of the film began in New Delhi on International Women's Day, 2016. The looks of Amitabh Bachchan in the movie was created by Shoojit Sircar however the idea of wearing the mask was suggested by Amitabh Bachchan since Delhi is very polluted. During the shoot, Amitabh Bachchan wandered the streets of New Delhi while wearing a costume in which the public could not recognise him. Amitabh Bachchan finished filming his scenes in April 2016. Taapsee often broke down on the shooting sets as she felt her character was very strong and challenging. She suffered from viral infection during the court scenes and wanted to dub later, however Shoojit felt that her illness would add more authenticity to the scenes. Despite the hardships Taapsee enjoyed and had lots of fun while filming the scenes. The original climax of Rajvir and his friends winning the case was modified so as not to hurt the sentiments of the audience. A special screening of the film was held for Amitabh Bachchan's co stars and the leading ladies of Bollywood. However Amitabh Bachchan could not attend the screening due to health issues. Taapsee also arranged a special screening of the film for the Telugu film industry at Hyderabad. Bishan Singh Bedi, father of Angad Bedi, arranged a special screening of the film in Delhi which was attended by cricketers like Kapil Dev, Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh. Shoojit Sircar and Amitabh Bachchan questioned their fans on Twitter as to what they think the film title \"Pink\" is all about. Times of India had opened a contest in which 5 lucky winners would get a chance to meet Amitabh Bachchan and other 10 winners would get free movie tickets of the movie -Pink. The winners were announced on 15-September-2016. The world television premier was held on 23 \u2013 October 2016 on Star Gold and to commemorate the same, Amitabh Bachchan's house Jalsa, Carter Road Promenade and SNDT Women's University were illuminated in pink colour. The title of the film has no relationship as being the favourite colour of girls but rather conveys that, women should have the freedom to speak and walk freely at night. Meena Iyer of The Times of India and Shubha Shetty Saha of Indiatimes gave the film 4.5 stars. Mayank Shekhar from Mid Day gave the film 4/5 stars, saying, \"The film, up until the closing credits, does not even visually describe the said incident. It grips you still with a gently piercing background score, moments of silence and dialogue, building up the tension, while the audience wonders what really could have happened one unfortunate night when three girls found themselves in a Surajkund resort with three guys.\" Anna M.M. Vetticad of Firstpost called Pink a powerful film. Filmfare, India Today, Mumbai MIrror, Hindustan Times, The Statesman, and DNA have given 4/5 stars, highly appreciating the superlative performances, especially of Amitabh Bachchan. Critics like Anusha Iyengar and Mayank Shekhar called it movie of the year. Namrata Joshi of The Hindu also praised the film. Shubhra Gupta of Indian Express gave the film 3.5 stars. Rajeev Masand from CNN-News18 rated the movie as 4.5/5 mentioning that \"I left the cinema, my mouth dry at the end of Pink. This isn\u2019t just an important film, but also excellently made. It\u2019s a giant leap for Hindi cinema, and easily the best film this year\". Pink grossed approximately \u20b94.32 crore on first day in India. The first weekend collection was \u20b921.51 crore. At the end of 7 days the domestic box office collection was \u20b935.91 crore. Pink grossed \u20b950 crore in first 10 days in India.

The film received positive reviews and emerged as the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, and ranks as the 70th highest-grossing film of 2014 worldwide. The film has been regarded as one of the best Hindi films of 2014. PK is the first Indian film to gross \u20b97 billion worldwide. It is also the first Indian film to gross US$100 million (Rs 630 crore) worldwide.   A humanoid alien (Aamir Khan) lands on Earth naked on a research mission in Rajasthan, but is stranded when the remote control of his spaceship is stolen. He manages to get the thief's cassette recorder, a Panasonic RQ-565D. On the same day in Bruges, Jaggu (Anushka Sharma) meets Sarfaraz (Sushant Singh Rajput) and falls in love with him. Jaggu's father (Parikshit Sahni) objects to their relationship because Sarfaraz is a Pakistani Muslim, while Jaggu is a Hindu. He consults godman Tapasvi Maharaj (Saurabh Shukla) who predicts that Sarfaraz will betray Jaggu. Determined to prove them wrong, Jaggu proposes to Sarfaraz, who accepts. She is heartbroken at the wedding chapel when she receives a letter calling off the marriage due to their cultural differences. Jaggu returns to India and becomes a TV reporter. She meets the alien and is intrigued to see him distribute leaflets about the \"missing\" Gods. She saves him when he attempts to take money from a collection box, earning his trust. The alien tells her that he is a research scientist from another planet. His people know nothing about dressing, religion or verbal communication. They transfer ideas by holding hands. The alien learned to fit in among humans by wearing clothes and using money stolen from couples having sex in \"dancing cars\". In the flashback, after being accidentally hit by a truck, the alien is befriended by bandmaster Bhairon Singh (Sanjay Dutt), who takes him along with his troop. The alien attempts to learn to communicate by grabbing peoples' hands but people chase him away, believing him to be a pervert. Bhairon takes him to a brothel, where the alien holds a prostitute's (Reema Debnath) hand for six hours and thus learns the Bhojpuri language. Bhairon has a conversation with the alien, and suggests that the thief may be in Delhi. The alien leaves for Delhi. Due to his strange behavior, the people assume he is drunk and call him \"PK\" (pee-kay, Hindi for \"drunk\"). People tell him that only \"God\" can help him find his remote. PK sincerely practices every Indian religion attempting to find \"God\", to no avail. He later discovers that Tapasvi has his remote, who claims it was a gift from God, and refuses to return the remote. Jaggu promises PK that she will recover his remote and he can go back home. PK conjectures that Tapasvi and other godmen must be dialling a \"wrong number\" to communicate with God, and are therefore advising the public to engage in meaningless rituals. Jaggu encourages the public to expose fraudulent godmen, by sending their videos to her news channel. This \"wrong number\" campaign turns into a popular mass-movement, to the dismay of Tapasvi. Meanwhile, Bhairon finds the thief and contacts PK, telling him that he sold his remote control to Tapasvi, after which PK realises that Tapasvi was actually a fraud all along and that it wasn't a \"wrong number\". Bhairon then informs him that they will come to Delhi, but both die in a terrorist attack. The terrorist attack is later declared by Tapasvi's group to be stated as protecting their Gods. Tapasvi decides to confront PK on-air. Tapasvi asks PK what the \"right number\" is. PK says that \"God that created us all\" is the only concept people should believe in, and that the other \"duplicate Gods\" are created by man. Tapasvi argues, saying that PK is trying to take people away from their Gods and that they will not stand for their Gods being taken away from them either. He claims he has a direct connection to God and refers to his prediction of Sarfaraz's betrayal to try to prove that Muslims are liars, but PK disagrees. PK realises that Sarfaraz did not write the letter. The letter was not for Jaggu. She contacts the Pakistani Embassy in Belgium where Sarfaraz worked part-time. The embassy tells her that Sarfaraz still loves her, and transfers the line to Sarfaraz, who is now living in Lahore. Jaggu and Sarfaraz reconnect, and Tapasvi is forced to return PK's remote, while also being exposed to the whole of India that he had planned to break Jaggu and Sarfaraz through his \"predictions\". Meanwhile, PK has fallen in love with Jaggu, but refrains from telling her because she loves Sarfaraz. Having filled multiple audio tapes with her voice alone, he takes two suitcases full of tapes and extra batteries when leaving for home. After his departure, Jaggu publishes a book about him. One year later, PK returns to Earth on a new research mission on human nature along with several other aliens (including one played by Ranbir Kapoor). \u201cPK\u201d was the only film which began from a desire to say something. I can\u2019t say what that thing is. The battle was the other way round\u2014how do you say such a serious thing in an entertaining way? For many years, we were struggling, until we finally found a way, where it will be entertaining, won\u2019t be offensive\u2014will hit the right notes, basically. After the success of 3 Idiots, director Rajkumar Hirani and writer Abhijat Joshi started work for next project, they had written a story about a character who had the ability to get into another person\u2019s mind to make that person a better human being. They spent one year to write a story, but it turned out to be similar to Inception. After watching Inception, Hirani and Joshi were shocked by the similarities between the films. Eventually, they decided to scrap the film, then Hirani and Joshi reworked on the script, changing the entire tone and angle. It took five years to make the film and three years to write it. In the film Khan played nine different avatars and during the course of the film, the actor had to chew over 10,000 betelnut preparations called paan. Betelnut is a psychoactive stimulant used throughout Asia and characterized by its ability to stain users' mouths red. \"In real life paan is not a habit, I have it once in a while but for this film I chew paan for every scene. I would at times eat about 100 paans in a day. We had a paanwala [a paan maker] on the sets,\" said Khan in the report. For every take, Khan had to eat a fresh paan to fill his mouth, also before beginning the shoot he would eat at least 10-15 paans to get the right color inside his mouth and on his lips. Viral Thakkar was the film's visual effects supervisor. The visual effects company was Riva Digital at a point employing 100 artists working on the film. In 2011, Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma signed on for the film. Khan's nephew Imran Khan and Ranbir Kapoor were considered for a role which eventually went to Sushant Singh Rajput before the release of his debut movie Kai Po Che. Earlier reports said that Rajkumar Hirani had signed Arshad Warsi for the film when it was reported that Arshad will be playing an important role in the movie. In 2013 Arshad said in an interview \"I couldn`t have worked out on dates. I wouldn`t refuse Raju for anything. In fact when he offered me the film, I did not even ask for the script, I was like I am ready to come on whenever you want. So that is the connection I share with Raju,\". Before Sushant and Arshad were signed on, R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi were said to be cast in the film. Junaid Khan, son of Aamir Khan worked as an assistant director in this film. In 2011, in its initial scripting stage, Rajkumar Hirani named the film 'Talli' then changed it to 'Ek Tha Talli' which he actually loved it but later on came to know that 'Ek Tha Tiger' was already in production which was released in 2012. So he dropped the idea and after many titles, he came up with a unique title which only had initials, 'PK'. After starting the film, Hirani felt PK was not a good enough title. He decided to change the title to \"Talli\". But after a few weeks of shooting, Hirani decided to go back to the original title. Firstpost compared PK to Hirani and Khan's previous collaboration 3 Idiots (2009), as they both involve \"A socially awkward and 'different' young man\u2014who walks and talks in a strange, enthusiastic childlike manner\u2014observes the system, questions it, asks you to look at the many ludicrous things that inform it, and eventually brings about a minor revolution.\" According to Rajkumar Hirani, PK is a \"satire on Hindu god and their godmen\". The co-director Khan began looking for shooting locations in July 2012. Second unit filming was set to begin in late 2012, which was stalled after the rumoured departure of three department heads for the film and bad weather stalling initial shoots. Hirani denied rumours that the film would be delayed, stating that principal filming had always been intended to begin in mid-January 2013 in Delhi and Rajasthan to \"capture the winter of Delhi\". Shooting officially began on 1 February 2013, with the filming scheduled to occur over a 45-day period. A 26-day schedule of shooting of PK started in Delhi from 27 September 2013. When the shoot of the film was going on in Chandni Chowk area of Delhi, an FIR was lodged against makers of the film for allegedly hurting religious sentiments in October 2013. The objection was regarding a scene in the film where a man dressed as the Hindu deity, Lord Shiva pulls the rickshaw with two burqa clad women as passengers. In July 2014, the makers released a motion poster of the film, revealing the first look. The poster sparked a controversy[vague] as it featured Aamir Khan posing almost nude with only a radio cassette recorder covering his genitals. Although the Central Board of Film Certification had already cleared the film, a PIL was filed in the court by the All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front to ban its release saying it promoted nudity and vulgarity. The Supreme Court dismissed the plea and gave the film a green signal. A case was lodged against Aamir Khan and Rajkumar Hirani in Rajasthan.[clarification needed] The second motion poster released on 20 August 2014, the poster features Aamir in a red angrakha teamed up with white pyjama and a trumpet in his hand. Aamir said at the launch of second poster \"There is a story in each and every image that we reveal. We will have a poster campaign and we will reveal eight to 10 posters till the time the film releases.\"  The third motion poster released on 15 September 2014, this time maker's launch Sanjay Dutt as Bhairon Singh. In this poster Aamir Khan asks the viewers, \"Why are you staring? It's not me. Its my friend\u2014Bhairon Singh.\" In last poster Aamir who is wearing a \"bandwaala\" costume, while this time he is seen wearing an oversized police uniform. The fourth motion poster featuring Anushka Sharma released on 16 October 2014. In the poster first Anushka dressed like Aamir holding a transistor and introducing herself as Jagat Janini after Anushka is seen wearing a plain T-shirt, shorts, & white long dress. The makers unlock a teaser trailer on 23 October 2014. The teaser achieved 3.4 million views on YouTube within 5 days, subsequently receiving 12 million views and has been regarded most viewed movie trailers on YouTube. The film's teaser was also attached with the film Happy New Year. The makers also released the videos of behind the scenes like making of the movie, characters, songs, PK funnies, PK ki bhasha, dialogue promos & battery recharge dance of Aamir and Anushka on YouTube.  In August the makers find a new promotional strategy to interact with the audiences by introducing talking standees. This is the first time in Bollywood film will be making of a talking standee at varied locations as a part of the film's promotions. The said standee will have Aamir Khan talking to people which will find a prominent place in popular theatres and multiplexes at various cities. In 7 December 2014, Aamir Khan begun the city tour for promotions with Patna. The character he plays in the film speaks in Bhojpuri which is the main language used for communication in Bihar. Aamir said at the event \u201cI have decided to launch the promotional campaign of my film \u2018PK\u2019 from Bihar to connect with the language. My character speaks Bhojpuri in the film.\u201d Hence the actor decided to start his promotional schedule from Bihar. Although he also wanted to visit Bhojpur, which is 60 kilometres away from Bihar, he could not because of security issues. In Bihar he visited the Litti Chokha stall to try the authentic flavor of the city. The Litti Chokha stall owner has renamed his stall on Aamir\u2019s name when he visited him last year and Aamir couldn\u2019t leave the city without visiting the stall again. Then the crew proceeded to Varanasi where they had a screening of their film 3 Idiots and they interacted with the people on a one on one basis. Aamir Khan made an impromptu visit to Krishana Paan shop for savour a Banarasi pan. The actor specially removed time from, his schedule to visit this place. He enjoyed a \"mitha banarasi paan\" there. After the crew visiting Delhi, Ahemdabad, Raipur, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Indore, Bangalore & various locations in India. Aamir and makers also promoted the film in Dubai. Indiagames, a part of Disney India\u2019s Interactive business, announced the launch of the official mobile game \u2018PK\u2019 based on the film.

The gamer has to avoid a number of obstacles on the way, which include cows, buses, Delhi trains, rickshaws, traffic jams and more. The various backdrops used in the game will give the player the feel of the actual movie. The film was earlier scheduled to release on June 6, 2014. The director who is also editor of the film, Rajkumar Hirani, wanted to spend more time on the editing. Besides, some portions with Sanjay Dutt were yet to be shot. Also, the second season of Satyamev Jayate was to kick off from March. So Aamir was not sure if he would be able to promote PK in June. Hence the makers of his film settled for a December release. Finally the film was released on 19 December 2014, as the 200th Bollywood release in 2014.

Prince is about a drama set in the times of resurgent India when the nation threw off the British Yoke, but some states still languished under the Princely yoke. It is the story of a Prince who brought about his own downfall so that he may rise as a human being.   Rajkumar Shamsher Singh is the only son of the local Maharaja, and has been brought up as a brat, and now he is an irresponsible, alcoholic, and womanizing adult, who wants everyone to bow down before him and his princely rank. One priest refuses to do so, and Shamsher pummels him mercilessly, in vain though. Frustrated, he asks the priest what he should do with his mundane life, and the priest tells him that he should repent, sacrifice all his palatial pleasures, and live the life of a simple and ordinary man, and hence learn the true meaning of life, for at least six months. Shamsher agrees to do so, and arranges an accident with his car, which plummets down a mountain, explodes and is blown to smithereens. Everyone in the palace believes that Shamsher is dead. He goes to a nearby village, and a blind woman there mistakes him for her long-lost son and starts calling him Sajjan Singh. Shamsher decides to play along as Sajjan. Two corrupt palace officials spot Sajjan, and notice his similarity to Shamsher, and conspire with him to pose as Shamsher for a hefty sum of money, to which Sajjan agrees. When he accompanies the officials back to the palace, he is shocked to find that his father has remarried a much younger woman, Ratna, and shortly after marrying her, has died, leaving the palace and its management to her and her greedy brother. Shamsher decides to reveal his true identity, but the officials threaten to expose him to his new-found blind mother, and Shamsher knows that he is trapped in the body of Sajjan Singh, forced to pose as none other than himself.

        "full_text": " Queen is a 2014 Indian comedy-drama film directed by Vikas Bahl and produced by Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane, and Madhu Mantena. The film stars Kangana Ranaut in the lead role, with Lisa Haydon and Rajkummar Rao playing supporting roles. Rani, an under-confident Punjabi girl from New Delhi embarks on her honeymoon to Paris and Amsterdam by herself after her fianc\u00e9 calls off their wedding. Bahl co-wrote the script of Queen with Chaitally Parmar and Parveez Shaikh. Anvita Dutt Guptan wrote the dialogues for the film. Ranaut, who was encouraged by Bahl to improvise her lines during filming, is credited as an additional dialogue writer. Amit Trivedi provided the musical score and Guptan also wrote the lyrics. Principal photography of the film began in 2012 and took 45 days to complete. Queen premiered at the Busan International Film Festival and released theatrically on 7 March 2014. The film garnered critical acclaim, with praise directed to the direction, writing, and Ranaut's performance. It is widely considered by critics to be one of the best films of 2014. Made on a budget of \u20b912.5 crore (US$1.9\u00a0million), the film earned over \u20b9108 crore (US$17\u00a0million) at the global box-office, emerging as a commercial success. Queen won several awards. At the 60th Filmfare Awards ceremony, the film won a leading six awards, including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Actress for Ranaut. At the 62nd National Film Awards ceremony, the film won the Best Hindi Film and Best Actress awards.   Rani Mehra is a sheltered, under-confident young Punjabi woman from Delhi. One day prior to her wedding, her fianc\u00e9 Vijay (Rajkummar Rao) tells her that he no longer wishes to marry her. He explains that his lifestyle has changed after living abroad in London, and her conservative habits and small town mentality would be a wrong match for him. Stunned and heartbroken by the development, Rani shuts herself in her room for a day. Wanting to take control of the situation, she asks her parents permission to go alone on her pre-booked honeymoon to Paris and Amsterdam. After initially hesitating, her parents agree, thinking that a vacation might cheer her up. In Paris, Rani meets Vijayalakshmi (Lisa Haydon), a free-spirited liberal woman of French-Spanish-Indian descent, who works at the hotel in which Rani stays. Overwhelmed by the new city and having gotten into trouble twice - once with the local police and once with a robber - Rani intends to return to India. However, Vijayalakshmi helps her out and gives her a tour around the city. The two have a series of adventures, during which Rani relives the memories of Vijay patronising her, criticising her, and forbidding her from dancing and drinking - which she's free to do in Paris. During one particular incident, Rani tries on what she considers to be a revealing outfit and accidentally sends a selfie of her wearing the outfit to Vijay instead of Vijayalakshmi. She quickly realises her mistake, but unbeknownst to her, the selfie regenerates his interest in Rani, and he begins to search for her in the hopes of a reconciliation. She decides not to return back to India, but rather go to Amsterdam as planned. Vijayalakshmi makes her accommodation arrangements and the two share an emotional farewell at the train station. However, when she arrives in Amsterdam, she finds to her horror that she has been booked to share a hostel room with three men: Taka from Japan, Tim from France and Oleksander from Russia. Despite being skeptical of the boys, she soon becomes good friends with them, and spends time shopping, sight seeing, visiting a sex shop, going to a church and meeting pole dancers in a club in the Red Light District. At the club, Rani befriends Roxette/Rukhsar, a Pakistani woman working as a dancer who is the sole bread-earner for her family back in Lahore, and who is also a friend of Vijaylakshmi. Rani slowly begins on a path of self discovery. She start to gain confidence by taking control of her decisions, and even develops a crush on a local restaurant owner. She also realises her cooking and earning potential by winning a cook-off by selling gol gappas (an Indian street snack). She learns more about her friends' backgrounds and begins to understand how different life can be for people in other parts of the world. One day, Rani finds Vijay waiting for her outside the hostel. Vijay apologizes to Rani and asks her to reconsider the relationship. Their conversation escalates, since she is unwilling to forgive him and he learns that she has been living with three men. He tries to grab hold of Rani, but her friends retaliate, and she asks him to leave. The two meet the next day to discuss the future, but Rani leaves abruptly, saying that she would rather speak to him after she returns to Delhi. She then meets up with her friends one last time at a rock concert which she had previously chosen not to attend, in order to meet with Vijay. After bidding an emotional farewell to them, Rani returns to India. Back in Delhi, Rani visits Vijay at his home, while she is on the way back from the airport. Vijay and his family think assume that she has come in order to reconcile. Instead, Rani hands him her engagement ring and after saying \"thank you\", she walks away with a smile on her face. Producer-director Vikas Bahl made his directorial debut with Chillar Party (2011), co-directed with Nitish Tiwari, which won three National Film Awards. Since he liked the story of Queen, he decided to direct the film himself. It was eventually produced by Viacom 18 Motion Pictures and Phantom Films, which he co-owns with Anurag Kashyap and Vikram Motwane. He wrote the script, the character of Rani was based on the people he had observed while growing up in Delhi. \"I know life for girls is planned out for them by their families. They lose their own perspective on life and they are okay with that.\" In a scenario where as a girl crosses 20, her family gets busy to get her \"settled\", she never plans anything by herself, unless as in this case of Rani, marriage plans go awry. Thus the script was developed so that in the \"first half, Rani gets over the guy, and in the second, she gets over herself.\" Bahl wrote the script of the movie keeping in mind Kangana Ranaut, however it was Anurag Basu who connected him with Kangana and helped cast her in the film. After her audition, actress Lisa Haydon, who played an Indo-French hotel staff member, Vijaylaksmi, practiced French for a month. Other actors Mish Boyko (Alexander) and Jeffery Ho (Taka) were cast after auditions in London, while Joseph Guitobh (Tim), who played Rani's third roommate, was spotted singing on a street and was asked whether he'd be interested in working in Hindi film, though he couldn't speak English. The film was shot in late 2012 over a period of 45 days, starting with Paris, followed by Amsterdam and Delhi. Despite shooting abroad, Vikas Bahl did not have a huge budget to spend on the film. He took a crew of 25 people from India to shoot the film in about 145 locations in 40 days. Locations were booked a couple of hours, before the crew would rush to another location as they often shot 3-4 locations in a day. The crew would eat their meals at nearby restaurants, and at times actors including lead Kangana Ranaut would change clothes in nearby public toilets and restaurants. Since the film was not shot in a linear fashion, the colour of mehndi, applied to bride's hand was faded to match its natural fading. During the filming upon Ranaut's suggestion some scenes were added, like the kiss scene with the Italian chef, and a small scene where Rani asks a stranger to click her picture in Amsterdam. She even ended up writing a lot of her dialogues, and was given credit for the additional dialogues. In fact during filming, the director allowed all the actors to improvise their dialogues, to add realism to the film. The remixed version of \"Hungama Ho Gaya\" was shot at Club NL, in Amsterdam, where a Hindi song was played for the first time. However, when 90 percent of the film was already shot, film's cinematographer Bobby Singh died suddenly following an asthma attack on 25 December 2012, after just having completed a schedule in Delhi. After seeing rushes of the film, Anurag Kashyap volunteered to edit the film himself and since Bahl didn't have any editors at the time, he too agreed. The trailer of the film was released on 20 December 2013. The film's soundtrack is composed by Amit Trivedi, with lyrics by Anvita Dutt. The Music of Queen was launched at Kala Ghoda Arts Festival, Mumbai on 2 February 2014. An additional track was released on 1 March, it was the remixed version of hit cabaret number of the 1970s Hungama Ho Gaya sung by Asha Bhosle for the film, Anhonee (1973) was remixed by Amit Trivedi for the film, with additional vocals by Arijit Singh. The song was also used in end credits of the film. Queen, as well as Ranaut's performance, won acclaim from critics. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film 4/5 stars and called the film \"spicy, balmy and uplifting\" and added, \"Kangana is the heart and soul of Queen and she does not strike a single false note\". Raja Sen from Rediff also awarded the film 4/5 stars and called Kangana \"gobstoppingly spectacular\", adding that the film is \"a showcase for an actress poised to reign\". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 4/5 stars calling it \"rare and disarming\" and described Kangana's performance as \"raw, nuanced, delicately comical\". Anupama Chopra praised Kangana's performance, hailing it as \"artfully transparent and heartfelt\", but said the film is \"meandering and indulgent\" at places, rating it 3.5/5 stars. Sarita Tanwar from Daily News and Analysis awarded the film 4.5/5 stars and said, \"Queen is irresistible. Highly recommended. A must-see film.

        "full_text": " Kalyanji-Anandji\nBiddu Qurbani (English: Sacrifice) is a 1980 Bollywood action drama thriller film. It was produced and directed by Feroz Khan (under the banner of FK International). The film stars Feroz Khan, Vinod Khanna, Zeenat Aman, Amjad Khan, Shakti Kapoor, Aruna Irani, Amrish Puri and Kadar Khan. It is an adaptation of the 1972 Italian film \"The Master Touch\".   Rajesh (Feroz Khan) was a motorcycle stuntman in a circus and is now a thief, expert in breaking open treasuries. In one such robbery, he is being watched by a jolly but shrewd police inspector Amjad Khan (Amjad Khan). Sheela (Zeenat Aman) is a gorgeous disco club dancer and singer. Rajesh and Sheela are in love. Rajesh has not disclosed to Sheela that he is a thief. An evil brother-sister duo- Vikram (Shakti Kapoor) and Jwaala (Aruna Irani) seek revenge against crime boss Rakka (Amrish Puri) who cheated Jwaala and siphoned her money. Vikram meets Rajesh in jail. Inspector Amjad Khan arrests Rajesh for theft after he is seen by an officer at a traffic accident. The court sentences Rajesh to two years imprisonment. Sheela is devastated after she realizes Rajesh was a thief. Meanwhile, Amar (Vinod Khanna) is an ace crime member in Rakka's gang who revolts against Rakka. He is a widower with a daughter Tina (Natasha Chopra) studying in a boarding school. However, before quitting Rakka's gang, Amar has committed a crime, masked, and inspector Amjad Khan is investigating that case. Amar saves Sheela from a gang of rowdy bikers. They meet regularly as Sheela likes Amar's daughter Tina. Soon Amar begins to love Sheela who does not reciprocate because she still loves Rajesh. After short time Amar and Shiela get together. Rajesh completes his jail sentence. While returning, he meets Vikram who again reminds him of the deal to rob Rakka. During the conversation, Amar incidentally reaches the site and a fist fight ensues between Amar and Vikram. While fleeing, Vikram swears revenge against Amar. Thus Rajesh and Amar meet for the first time. Rajesh takes Amar to introduce to Sheela; Sheela and Amar pretend as if they do not know each other since they don't want Rajesh to unnecessarily suspect them. Later Vikram's goons kidnap Amar's daughter and beat Amar who is hospitalized. In return for Amar and his daughter's safety, Rajesh agrees to do Vikram's job. He nurses Amar back to normalcy and soon they turn thick friends. Amar promises Rajesh he will support him in this one last robbery. They plan to shift to London after the robbery with the money. They concoct a scheme whereby Amar would steal gold bars and jewellery from a safe, phone the police, let Rajesh take over, get arrested, and get a prison term for about 12 to 18 months. After his release, he will join Amar in the U.K. Things don't go according to plan as Rajesh gets arrested for killing Rakka while Amar and Sheela reach London with the money. Rajesh construes that Amar deliberately framed him so that he can get Rajesh out of the way, keep all the money (as well as Sheela) for himself. Rajesh escapes from jail and reaches London to apprehend Amar. After a brief tussle, Rajesh realizes the truth and that Amar did not frame him. Vikram and his goons reach London to take revenge against Rajesh and Amar. In the climax of the movie, Amar sacrifices his life to save Rajesh, Sheela and Tina from getting killed by Vikram. To draw shock from the audience, a scene was included with the calculated decimation of a Mercedes Benz in an underground parking lot. This was at a time when not many in India had seen a Mercedes, let alone sat in one. UK stunts were designed and arranged by James Dowdall, photographed by Eric Van Herren and produced by Nick Farnes who, with James Dowdall, wrote the UK scenario. Feroz Khan initially asked Amitabh Bachchan to play the role of Amar. Amitabh replied he would be available in 6 months according to Feroz, but Feroz could not wait that long. So the role of Amar went to Vinod Khanna Qurbani became a box office success and the biggest hit of the year,Earning 6,00,00,000 at the Box Office.Its songs were popular and the movie sold the most number of records and tapes in that year. It is said the music and songs ushered in the \"Disco Revolution\" in India that lasted until the mid 80s. \"aap jaisa koi\" had a strong impact towards audience Biddu was the music director for the song 'Aap Jaisa Koi' which introduced him and Pakistani singer Nazia Hassan to Indian films. The first initial song Biddu recorded for Qurbani was a Hindi version of a Boney M song. When Nazia Hassan and Zoheb Hassan heard it, they refused saying they didn't want to sing a copy.They insisted they wanted an original song. A reluctant Biddu asked them what they had in mind. That's when \"Aap Jaisa Koi \" was born. The rest of the songs and the background score were set by Kalyanji-Anandji. The song Laila O Laila was also very popular. The movie is known for its music and songs, including the title qawwali Qurbani Qurbani, written by the Urdu poet, Faruk Kaiser and rendered by Anwar, Kishore Kumar and Aziz Nazan. It has a song performed by Mohammed Rafi, Kya Dekhte Ho, which was written by Indeevar. Qurbani Qurbani received a special award for 'The Most Amazing Evergreen Song' by Bollywood music producer, Rajesh Roshan. Feroz Khan met Biddu and Nazia Hassan at a party hosted by a close friend in England in 1980. Nazias parents insisted Feroz listen to Nazia sing. Feroz did and was highly impressed. But Feroz had his eye on International star Biddu to score a song for Qurbani. Biddu was reluctant to score music for an Indian film. It was with sincere persistence and Feroz telling Biddu to do it for his mom who lived in India. Feroz also played the Banglore card with Biddu since both Feroz and Biddu both hailed from Banglore. Many music directors (Including the film's original music directors Kalyanji Anandji) opposed Feroz Khan hiring Biddu to score a solo song in the film. Many tried to stop this because they viewed Biddu as an outsider. After several discussions, Feroz Khan stuck to his choice. Qurbani was remade in Tamil as Viduthalai in 1986 by producer K. Balaji. The film had Rajnikant in Feroze Khan's role and Dr.Vishnuvardhan in Vinod Khanna's role and was shot in United States of America, but was an utter failure.",

Exit polls predict a victory for Indu's party. On the counting day, Samar lures Veerendra and Sooraj to an unused factory by spreading a rumour about electronic voting machines being hacked. They fall in the trap, and Veerendra gets shot by Samar and his men. Sooraj has an open opportunity to shoot Samar, but can't bring himself to do it since he knows Samar is his brother.

Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India rated it 4/5 and said, \"The film basically anchors its plot in two classic tales \u2014 The Mahabharata and The Godfather \u2014 to create an engrossing diatribe on India's political system where democracy may prevail, but not in its purest form.\" Anupama Chopra of NDTV rated it 3/5 and said \"Jha creates a real sense of the machinations and sordid deals that fuel politics but then hobbles it with outlandish twists and some decidedly 'filmy' moments\". Rajeev Masand of IBN said, \"Raajneeti is thrilling and gripping for the most part, even though it does lose steam in its final act. For the superb acting, and for the exciting dramatic highs, it's a film I recommend you do not miss.\" Rachel Saltz of The New York Times said, \"[T]he film \u2013 full of romance, intrigue and fraternal strife \u2013 is too diffuse to score political points. Or to have much impact.\" Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times found that while it aimed \"for something trenchant about thwarted destiny and ugly ambition in modern Indian democracy\", it \"mostly winds up with a convoluted and tonally awkward Godfather rehash, with nary a character worth rooting for\" and that \"Kapoor's performance is stony rather than calculating....\" Frank Lovece of Film Journal International said, \"More pulpy than political, this Godfather-ripoff Hindi electoral drama is a candidate for oblivion in U.S. theatres. ... [I]t all eventually becomes so ridiculous and over-the-top violent that there is nobody, nobody, to root for.\" Rajneeti grossed \u20b91,431.1 million (US$22\u00a0million) worldwide.

However, what they find in their new home is more than they expected when a ghost starts haunting the place. The wife, Anjana suddenly finds that her husband is part of the ghostly conspiracy, which she must fix to escape. The film is an unofficial adaptation of What Lies Beneath. It was the second highest grossing film of the year 2002 behind Devdas, and the first installment in the Raaz series. Bipasha Basu was nominated for the Filmfare Best Actress Award. Raaz also marked the debut of actress Malini Sharma. A sequel to the film was released in 2009, under the title of Raaz: The Mystery Continues and the third installment of the series titled Raaz 3 was released on 7 September 2012. A fourth film, Raaz Reboot, has been released recently on 16 September 2016.   The film starts with a group of college students enjoying a picnic in a beautiful forest in Ooty. One of the girls, Nisha (Mink Brar) in that group, dies after being attacked under mysterious circumstances outside a bungalow in front of the forest. She had attacked her boyfriend too, who, though injured, managed to live on. She was rushed to the hospital, where just before dying, her facial look and voice changed completely for a short while, thus confusing all the attending doctors. Professor Agni Swaroop (Ashutosh Rana), who is supposedly an expert in phenomena involving the unexplained and the supernatural is called by the police to look into the matter. Prof. Swaroop and the police visit the forest at the same place where Nisha was attacked and after investigating from Nisha's boyfriend, Prof. Swaroop declares that she was attacked by a spirit. He further reveals that this spirit has waked for some purpose and it will not stop until that purpose is fulfilled. The story then turns to Sanjana Dhanraj (Bipasha Basu) and Aditya Dhanraj (Dino Morea) in Mumbai in a business party, where Aditya seems too busy to pay heed to the fact that his wife is longing to talk to him. She snatches the car keys from Aditya's pocket and leaves the party to return home. On her frantic drive home, she hears a voice in her head and loses control of the car. However, miraculously, she escapes the accident unscathed. After her recovery, Sanjana asks her husband for a divorce; Aditya, however, realises his fault and suggests a vacation to work out their problems. He offers Sanjana a trip to any corner of the world for some days and Sanjana chooses to return to Ooty (where their relationship first began) to save their failing marriage. In Ooty they stay in the same bungalow behind which Nisha was attacked. Initially, the couple enjoy their stay at the cottage but soon Sanjana starts experiencing mysterious things, such as hearing a woman screaming in the forest behind the cottage and inexplicable falling of objects. She later learns that their housekeeper's husband, Robert, also used to hear strange voices from the forest, and that he ran from the house in fear once he could bear it no more. She shares her problems with her friend Priya (Shruti Ulfat), a local girl, who advises Sanjana to visit Professor Swaroop. Prof. Swaroop arrives at the cottage and after a short investigation announces the presence of a spirit in the house. He also tells Sanjana about the earlier incident involving the girl who was attacked and killed by an evil spirit in those very woods. He then revisits the same spot in the forest where Nisha was attacked, this time accompanied by Priya and Sanjana. Sanjana goes alone to talk to that spirit, where after some time, she discovers a revolver. All three of them go to an arms store to learn more and are told by the shopkeeper that the revolver was licensed to a retired colonel named Col. Arjun Malik. They visit the colonel's house, suspecting him to be a murderer of innocent girls, but soon learn from the colonel that the spirit is actually his own daughter, Malini (Malini Sharma), who was mentally ill and had managed to escape from the mental asylum several times. Using the methodology suggested by Prof. Swaroop, Sanjana summons the spirit, believing that the spirit wants to tell her something. The spirit conveys that Malini had met Aditya when he came to Ooty the previous year for work. When Sanjana confronts Aditya, he admits that he had stayed at the same cottage where Sanjana and Aditya are currently staying. They eventually learn that Malini and Aditya had an affair and that Aditya rebuked Malini's demands that he leave his wife, claiming that the affair was never meant to be anything more than physical. An enraged Malini commits suicide in front of Aditya inside of his home. Aditya, with the help of his then manservant Robert, buried the dead girl's body in the forest behind the cottage. Sanjana storms off in anger leaving Aditya alone. Prof. Swaroop tells Sanjana that all this was an attempt by Malini's spirit to separate Sanjana and Aditya to take him with her into the afterlife. He believes that the spirit's next step would be to kill Aditya and that they should rush to Aditya before Malini attacks him. Sanjana goes to Aditya and tells him that she is doing this just to save him and that they should leave for Mumbai in their car immediately. After they leave, Sanjana, Priya and Prof. Swaroop arrive at the cottage where the bewildered maid tells them that Aditya just left with her. Prof. Swaroop realises that the earlier Sanjana was Malini's spirit in disguise and they rush after the car. Malini's spirit meanwhile causes the car in which Aditya is travelling to fall off a cliff. Aditya goes into a coma and is hospitalized. To prevent the spirit from succeeding in her plans, Sanjana, Priya and Prof. Swaroop go into the forest to locate the girl's body to burn it. Prof. Swaroop uses the lemon tied to a small thread for locating the dead body, believing that it will turn red after reaching the exact spot where dead body is supposed to be. Prof. Swaroop gives them the advice that it is better to burn the body here and goes to bring the petrol from the car. As he is getting the petrol from the car, a nearby power pole suddenly falls down and kills him. After sometime a possessed Prof. Swaroop arrives at the spot and gives the can full of petrol to Sanjana, in the meanwhile Prof. Swaroop attacks the three girls with a hoe but they somehow manage to escape. While pursued by the ghost, Sanjana finds the dead body of their old servant Robert hung on a tree, when suddenly Prof. Swaroop comes from behind and tries to kill her with the hoe, but she somehow manages to run towards the dead body, while the possessed Prof. Swaroop gets badly injured. Sanjana tries to burn the body, but as she is doing so, the spirit attacks her. She succeeds in getting to the dead body to burn it, and hence saves her husband.

        "full_text": " Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (English: A Match Made By God) is a 2008 Indian romantic comedy film written and directed by Aditya Chopra and produced by Yash Chopra and Aditya Chopra under the banner Yash Raj Films. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma. Khan plays a mild-mannered office worker named Surinder Sahni, whose love for the beautiful and vivacious Taani (Anushka Sharma) causes him to transform himself into the loud and fun-loving \"Raj\" to win her love. It was released worldwide on 12 December 2008 and marked Aditya Chopra's return to directing after an eight-year break, following his previous film, Mohabbatein. The film was not heavily promoted pre-release, contrary to previous Khan or Yash Raj films, mainly because of the filmmakers' decision to keep it low-profile because of the terror attacks in Mumbai. Upon release, the film received positive reviews and broke many box office records. It was declared a blockbuster despite the fact that it was released only two weeks after the 2008 Mumbai attacks, amidst uncertainty and apprehensions from the trade regarding market conditions at the time. At the end of its theatrical run, it grossed over \u20b91.58 billion (US$24\u00a0million) worldwide and was also the highest-grossing film of the year in the overseas market, thus becoming Yash Raj Films and Shahrukh Khan's highest-grossing film at the time of its release. The film's soundtrack was composed by Salim-Sulaiman, and it became the first Bollywood soundtrack to reach the top ten albums sales for the iTunes Store. The film's script was recognised by a number of critics and was invited to be included in the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, just a day after its release. The script is accessible for research purposes only; students, filmmakers, writers and actors are among the regular patrons.   Shy, introverted and kind-hearted Surinder \"Suri\" Sahni (Shah Rukh Khan) is an office employee for Punjab Power. He meets the daughter of his former teacher, and professor (M.K. Raina), beautiful and vivacious Taani Gupta (Anushka Sharma), during the preparations for her wedding. A short time later, the shocking news arrives that her fiance and his wedding entourage were killed in a road accident. Taani's father suffers a major heart attack due to the news. On his deathbed, fearing that Taani will be alone in the world and unable to bear the trauma, the professor requests that Surinder marry her. Surinder silently concedes because he likes her anyway, and Taani agrees for her father's sake. After an impromptu wedding, Surinder takes Taani to his ancestral home in Amritsar. While his good nature leads Surinder to treat her with exceptional care\u00a0\u2013 he even lets her have his bedroom all to herself\u00a0\u2013 he is too frightened to profess his love for her. Taani later tells him that she will try to be a good wife and thus respect her role in his life, but that she can never love him due to having no love left within her after the loss of her fiance. Surinder, grateful for the increasing acts of wifely affection that she shows, proceeds to indulge her wishes. These include regular evening trips to the cinema to see Bollywood movies which appeal to Taani's fantasies about romance and her passion for dancing. One day, while walking in the market, Taani sees a poster about a dancing competition; she soon asks for Surinder's permission to take the expensive dance class with a visiting Bombay company, to unwind from her mundane and boring life at home. He grants her request and provides the entry fee. During the evenings that Surinder and Taani spend at the movies, Surinder realises it is the strong and masculine images that Taani admires, and later on, he asks his long-time best friend, Balwinder \"Bobby\" Khosla (Vinay Pathak), a hair-salon owner, for grooming advice so as to help him win her love. Bobby gives him a complete makeover which includes trimming off his mustache (an accidental gag, due to the power cutting off), changing his hairstyle (putting on lots of gel and shaping it to be spiky), and fitting him out in a funky Western-style clothing, which he feels is very tight, from the front and the back, including aviator-style shades with oversize pastel lenses. Surinder is thus transformed into \"Raj,\" a name he borrows from the hero of a movie that Taani had admired. After having that makeover change done by \"Bobby\", Surinder goes to Taani's dancing competition venue to see her dance, without her recognising him, but he then gets pulled into the dance recital by an instructor. At the end of that dance class, all of the participants were put into groups of two by random numbers given by the staff, and somehow, both Surinder and Taani had the number '21'. By chance, or, as Surinder puts it that it was not chance but it was by the divine choice of God and so he becomes Taani's partner in the competition. Despite Raj's initial over-the-top attempts to emulate the \"cool\" images given by heroes, in movies, after the first attempt of impressing Taani in that way, Taani reacts badly, telling 'Raj' to never flirt with her. He and Taani become friends as they work together on their dance routine. Surinder feels encouraged when Taani does not want to tie a rakhi on Raj's wrist during the festival of Raksha Bandhan (doing so would indicate that she thought of him only as a brother). Soon Raj is unable to dance and thus decides to quit the dance competition during the rehearsals and thus is encouraged by Taani. Finally they both are selected for the finals and decide to do a competition of Golgappa (an Indian snack) it is decided that whoever wins this competition can ask for any thing from the other. Raj wins the competition and doesn't ask for anything then. The next day Raj then decides to invite her to his birthday, claiming the prize for beating her in an eating competition. He tells Taani of how he always spends his birthday alone. So they go on a day of visiting Punjab's wonderful cultures, thus, after some time, Raj declares his love for her. Taani is shocked, to say the least, and enters into a period of internal conflict. Surinder also faces a dilemma in Taani's misery. He thus attempts to win Taani's love as Surinder, an act which only alienates her further. She eventually runs away to find Raj to tell him the predicament she is in, hoping he will help her. He offers to elope with her, which she agrees to, tearfully. They set the date for their elopement to the next night, the night of the competition (the finals). Surinder is disappointed that Taani cannot see his love for her as himself, only as 'Raj'. Later that night, Surinder tells Bobby that he will end the charade in his own way, sacrificing his cravings for her love, leaving her his property and transferring himself to Delhi. On the day of the competition, Surinder takes Taani to the Golden Temple to gain God's blessings for her performance for that night and, internally, also for her life without 'Raj'. While there, Taani has a realisation in which she believes God has shown her a sign that her marriage to Surinder is divinely inspired. For the first time she reflects on her husband and becomes aware of the strength and integrity of Surinder's character, something which she can grow to love. Taani thus tells Raj on the night of the competition, that she cannot choose him over her husband. She leaves him in what appears to be a state of shock with tears in his eyes. When the time comes for their performance, Taani is stunned to see Surinder instead of Raj joining her on stage. While dancing Taani puts two and two together and through a series of flashbacks, she awakens to the fact that Surinder is in fact 'Raj'. Backstage, after their dance, she confronts Surinder, and when he confesses his love for her, she tearfully admits that she reciprocates his feelings. The two win the competition. The film ends with Surinder and Taani visiting Japan on their honeymoon.  Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi tells a story from the point of view of an ordinary person and, most importantly, conveys a message that being 'ordinary' is cool. The filmmakers were confident that it would be able to strike a chord with millions because the film has ordinary people as its target audience: \"As middle-class people, so many of us have a routine life. We wake up in the morning, get dressed, go to office, come back, sometimes for a change we buy things to take home, watch TV, eat dinner and go to sleep. And then we repeat this day after day, week after week. Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi talks about one such man who lives a routine life. It is simple film at heart.\" In February 2008, Aditya Chopra announced that he will helm another film titled \"Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi\" and that it will star his lucky mascot, Shah Rukh Khan. The female lead was to be a newcomer who would be chosen following a massive talent hunt for a young, demure woman with quintessential Punjabi features. In May, Yash Raj announced the casting of the 19-year-old model Anushka Sharma as the heroine opposite Shahrukh Khan. Yash Chopra commented: \"We were looking first for someone who could truly embody the spirit of small town Punjab. We know we have found her in Anushka. While she has no previous acting experience, we have seen that unique spark in her that makes us confident that she will be a standout even opposite Shah Rukh\" Sharma was chosen over hundreds of girls for this role and was kept hidden from the media during the filming. When asked about that, Khan said: \"The idea was not to keep her a secret; we wanted her work to speak for her. When new actors come into films, it is important for people to see their work and then question them. It becomes easier after the film releases.\" Vinay Pathak was cast to play an important role in the film, making it its first commercial outing. Filming began in May 2008; Yash Chopra was present at the shoot. A portion was shot with Khan at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Punjab. Khan had to lose the six-pack abs he developed for the song \"Dard-E-Disco\" of Om Shanti Om since he was playing the role of a very normal, regular person. The first poster of Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi was released in October in theatres and multiplexes across India, with full-page advertisements in national dailies. The first theatrical promo was released on 14 November, during the screening of Karan Johar's Dostana. Initially very little was known about the movie, and there were many theories floating around on the Internet about the story. The first music promo of the song \"Haule Haule\" was released on 2 November 2008, across all leading television channels to coincide with Khan's birthday. The song promo had received unanimous praise from the public. Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi was released across 30 countries worldwide on 12 December 2008 on over 1,200 screens, including approximately 300 prints for the overseas market, making it the first time a Bollywood film was released on such a wide scale. Before release, the film witnessed a large volume of advance bookings. Aditya Chopra, who is known for maintaining secrecy over his films and not showing them to anyone until the day of release, made an exception and held a special screening on 23 November 2008 at Yash Raj Studios. The screening was attended by Khan and his family, Karan Johar, Yash Chopra and debutant Anushka Sharma. There was a huge debate in the industry whether Aditya Chopra's decision to go ahead with the release of film in the wake of the terror strikes in Mumbai was the right one. With the trauma of the terrorist attacks on Mumbai city on 26, 27 and 28 November still fresh, there was divided opinion on the release schedule. While some felt that Chopra should go ahead with the release because the public, tired and depressed after watching news of the attacks and the aftermath on television screens, would be waiting for a true entertainer to divert its mind, others thought he should postpone the film release as the audiences, not just in Mumbai but all over the country, were still not in a mood to visit theatres. Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gave the DVD of Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi 3.5 out of 5 stars stating that it is a good choice if you \"want to watch a clean family movie at home.\" The DVD includes the documentaries, The Making of the Film and The Making of the Songs (\"Haule Haule\", \"Dance Pe Chance\", \"Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte\") as well as a number of deleted scenes and interviews. The film was released on Blu-ray a year after its theatrical release. Upon release, the film received positive reviews. Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times calls Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi an \"agreeably amusing comedy/romance/musical\" noting that, \"the magnetic Khan is a skilled enough comic actor with his physical transformation\u2014like a Peter Sellers-ish recessive turning into a Jerry Lewis extrovert\u2014that believing Taani wouldn't notice isn't difficult.\" Rachel Saltz of The New York Times describes it as \"soft, sweet and slow, in the words of one of its songs. It deftly blends comedy, the ruling tone of the new Bollywood, with melodrama, the ruling tone of the old.\" Manish Gajjar of the BBC gave the film 4 out of 5 stars noting that, \"Shah Rukh Khan makes you laugh and cry as the nerdy-looking, clumsy, bespectacled Surinder and the all hip and happening Raj. A true professional in his own right, Khan breezes through his dialogues during the emotional and comic scenes.\" Frank Lovece of Film Journal International argues that it is \"smarter and more self-aware of its rom-com contrivances than most Hollywood movies\" and notes that while \"the movie's cleverness eventually devolves into a simplistic Harlequin-Romance-for-males wish-fulfillment about beauty and the geek, it's a very well-acted variation on a Hollywood staple.\" Critic and author Maitland McDonagh of MissFlickChick.com stated that the film, \"has been dismissed in some quarters as self-conscious and artificial, a coyly self-referential reworking of outdated movie tropes a la Todd Haynes' Far From Heaven, but it works for me in a way that most contemporary Hollywood romcoms don't.\" Some critics did not give the film very favourable reviews. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN was critical, giving it two out of five stars and stating that \"Aditya Chopra's return to direction after eight years is marked by a flawed script, which in turn spawns a disappointing film. Where's the smart dialogue and the spirited characters that defined his debut film, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge? There's no trace of either in this film ... the problem then, at the root of Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, is that much like those artificial sets in the film, the emotions too are contrived.\" Derek Elley of Variety argues that the film has \"a huge, hollow center that sinks the project early on ... A paper-thin script drags itself to the finish line amid tiresome mugging by Khan, a huge credibility gap (she never recognizes him without his glasses and mustache?) and a blah score with only one showstopper (featuring five famous actresses).\" A number of critics have further noted the similarities between this movie and superhero films. Khalid Mohamed, of the Hindustan Times, gave the film three and half out of five stars stating that Suri \"is a soul brother to the mousy Clark-Kent-cum-Superman\" who \"makes you laugh and sob alternately.\" Mayank Shekhar from Mumbai Mirror gave the film three out of five stars and argues that \"[The] same person, oppositely twinned, is usually the stuff of super-hero films; the kinds of Clark Kent-Superman, Peter Parker-Spiderman etc. You feel entirely lost in this fantasy flick, because for most part, it\u2019s built around something so intimate and real. It\u2019d be much easier to travel to foreign countries around far-fetched situations with fake heroes.\" In addition, Sudish Kamath of The Hindu states that while Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi could have been an interesting art film exploring the dynamics of an arranged marriage, the director instead \"treats this character type like Sam Raimi would treat Spider-Man ... Superhero 'Raj' slips into costume and out, complains how it gets uncomfortable around the crotch, to win over his Mary Jane with not much saving-the-world business to keep him busy. But while Spidey does it for a bigger reason than just MJ, Raj\u2019s sole motivation is to stalk his wife and play out his fantasy as somebody else. His obsession with his alter-ego reaches new heights when he wants his wife to cheat on the real him\u2014the goofy Surinder Saini who starts off well.\" Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi collected \u20b9420 million (US$6.5\u00a0million) in its opening week. By its fourth week, it had earned \u20b9860 million (US$13\u00a0million), making it Shah Rukh Khan's third consecutive blockbuster in two years and Aditya Chopra's third blockbuster as a director.[citation needed] The film grossed $8.43 million in the overseas market of which $2.09 million was contributed by the United States and $2.24 million from the UK, and was declared as a blockbuster overseas. At the end of its theatrical run, it grossed \u20b91,578.9 million (US$24\u00a0million) worldwide, thus becoming Yash Raj Films' and Khan's highest-grossing film at the time of its release. It was the second-highest-grossing film domestically and the highest-grossing in the overseas market that year. The soundtrack of Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi was composed by Salim-Sulaiman. The song \"Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte\" pays homage to Bollywood actors Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Rajesh Khanna, Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor and actresses Nargis, Nutan, Helen, Sharmila Tagore and Neetu Singh. The performance of the song includes appearances by Kajol, Bipasha Basu, Lara Dutta, Preity Zinta and Rani Mukerji. Serbian pop singer Jelena Karleu\u0161a remade the song \"Dance Pe Chance\" as \"Insomnia\" in 2010, and it became a huge hit. Bulgarian pop singer Ivana also made a copy of the same song as \"Nedei\". The Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi film score is the first Bollywood soundtrack to reach the top-ten albums sales for the iTunes Store.

It tells the story of a cab driver hailing from a small town, who falls in love with a rich girl. Aamir Khan and Karisma Kapoor play the lead roles. Juhi Chawla was first offered the lead actress role but she refused the film. Released on 15 November 1996, it is a remake of the 1965 Hindi film Jab Jab Phool Khile starring Shashi Kapoor and Nanda. The film's music is composed by Nadeem-Shravan with lyrics by Sameer. The film went on to win five Filmfare Awards including the awards for Best film and Best Actors, and seven Screen Awards. Raja Hindustani was the third most commercially successful Hindi film of the 1990s. Made on a budget of \u20b957.5 million, the film went on to gross \u20b9763.4 million worldwide, becoming the highest grossing film of the year. The film's music became popular and was successful especially in central and eastern states of India. Karisma Kapoor was complimented for her looks and performance as Aarti, a rich beautiful sensitive young girl full of dreams and desires. She won the Filmfare Best Actress Award for her role. The film was remade in Kannada as Naanu Naane in 2002 starring Upendra and Sakshi Shivanand in lead roles.   Raja Hindustani (Aamir Khan) is a young man who works as a taxi-driver/tourist guide. He lives by his own simple code and is prone to violence when that code is violated. Aarti Sehgal (Karisma Kapoor) is a wealthy debutante who is seeking to connect with her past. Standing in the way of their love are a disapproving father and a stepmother bent on obtaining total control of the family assets. Mr. Sehgal (Suresh Oberoi) lives with his daughter, Aarti, and her stepmother Shalini (Archana Puran Singh) in a grand palatial home. Aarti decides to go for a vacation to a small hill station town named Palankhet to discover the memories of her dead mother. Upon arrival, she finds out she has no transportation from the airport to Palankhet, and so she hires the services of the only available driver, Raja Hindustani. During her stay in Palankhet, Aarti and Raja bond and ultimately fall in love. One day, to Aarti's surprise, her father arrives in Palankhet and intends to take her home with him. Aarthi tells her father about Raja, but Mr Sehgal says that he will only accept the marriage on the condition that Raja goes to Mumbai and learns to become a respectable member of society. Raja refuses and forces Aarti to make a decision. Aarti chooses Raja, but begs for her father's blessings. Her father refuses to offer his blessings and leaves for Mumbai. After some time, Mr. Sehgal forgives his daughter, and visits her in Palankhet. While there, he gifts his daughter and son-in-law a new house. Raja refuses to live in the house because he does not see the house as a gift, but rather as charity, since he is poor and Mr. Sehgal is rich. Shalini, her brother, Swaraj (Pramod Moutho), and her nephew Jai (Mohnish Behl) seek to exploit this conflict to gain total control of Mr. Sehgal's assets. Under the pretext of a birthday party, they bring Raja and Aarti to Mumbai and set in motion events which cause Aarti and Raja separate. Aarti realises that she is pregnant but due to health problems, the doctor advises her not to travel, so instead her stepmother is asked to go to Palankhet to inform Raja about his baby and to request him to come to Mumbai. However, Aarti's stepmother chooses to tell Raja that Aarti wants to divorce him but, Raja refuses. After some time, Raja comes to know that Aarti has a had baby, and is under the impression that she indends to keep him away from the child. Fearing that he will never be allowed to see his baby, he decides to kidnap the child. Distraught, Aarthi goes to see Raja and begs him to let her have their child back. Ultimately, the lies and deception of Aarthi's step mother are all revealed and Aarthi and Raja reunite. Film critic Anupama Chopra while reviewing the film for India Today wrote, \"the film is disappointingly dated but Darshan scores with his music-catchy Pardesi, pardesi\u00a0\u2014 and with his leading lady, Karisma.\" She went on to praise Kapoor's performance saying, \"Karisma looks stunning and acts surprisingly well. She is the lifeblood of this otherwise banal film.\" Although Raja Hindustani earned \u20b9871.5 million worldwide, after adjusting inflation its worldwide gross reaches \u20b93.79 billion, making it the third highest grossing Hindi film of the 1990s.

It is based on story \"Yehi Sach Hai\" by noted Hindi writer Manu Bhandari. The movie stars Amol Palekar, Vidya Sinha and Dinesh Thakur in the lead. Rajnigandha won the Best Picture, the Popular Award and the Critics Award at the Filmfare Awards in 1975. Rajnigandha was considered to have a realistic outlook on cinema in 1974, an era when potboilers were ruling Bollywood. The film was the first screen role of Vidya Sinha and first Hindi film of Amol Palekar, both of whom went on to work with Basu Chatterjee in many films.   Deepa (Vidya Sinha) is a graduate student in Delhi who is in a long-term relationship with Sanjay (Amol Palekar), whom she plans to marry. Sanjay is a loquacious, humorous, and a good individual who is also rather lackadaisical and forgetful with no sense of punctuality. A job interview call from a college in Mumbai re-acquaints her with Navin (Dinesh Thakur) whom she had split up with under acrimonious circumstances. Navin is in every way the antithesis of Sanjay: He is very punctual and looks after her during her stay in Mumbai. Navin shows her the city and helps her with the job interview. This rekindles Deepa's feelings for him, and she finds herself torn between the two men and between her past and her present. Upon her return to Delhi, she feels that her first love (Navin) is her true love. She receives a letter stating that she has got the job in Mumbai. At the same time Sanjay comes to her house and tells her that he has got a promotion. Deepa then feels that she should forget the past and get married to Sanjay. Whom she decides to marry forms the climax of the movie. The film's music director was Salil Chaudhury rendered commercially successful tracks and the songs were written by Yogesh.

Dilip Kumar who was known as tragedy king surprised the audience with his comedy act. Dilip Kumar won the Filmfare best actor award while Upkar got most of the awards. Dilip Kumar stated in an interview \"The script of Ram Aur Shyam (1967) offered me endless stimulation. Each scene was sharply written to highlight the contrast between the characters and their predicaments.\" Ram Aur Shyam has inspired remakes in Hindi movies too, with Seeta Aur Geeta (featuring female twins, played by Hema Malini) in 1972; Chaalbaaz (starring Sridevi) in 1989; and Kishen Kanhaiya (starring Anil Kapoor) in 1990.

        "full_text": " Ram Teri Ganga Maili (literal translation: Ram, Your Ganga's Become Impure) is a 1985 Bollywood film directed by actor-director Raj Kapoor. The movie stars Mandakini and Rajiv Kapoor, son of Raj Kapoor. It was Raj Kapoor's last film. The film became a \"Blockbuster\" at the box office and went on to be the highest grossing Hindi film of 1985. The music director Ravindra Jain received a Filmfare Award for this film. The storyline of the film is somewhat similar to Pakeezah. The film became very controversial because of Mandakini's bold scenes of breastfeeding and bathing in a transparent saree, which wasn't something the conservative Indian Censor Board allowed at that point in time.   Ganga lives in Gangotri with her brother, Karam. One day she comes to the assistance of a young man, Narendra Sahay, who has come with a group of Calcutta-based college students to study the source of the holy river Ganga, and to get some holy water for his wheelchair-bound paternal grandmother. Both are attracted to each other, and on the next Puran Mashi get married, and spend the night together. Narendra leaves, but promises Ganga that he will be back soon. Months go by, but he does not return. She gives birth to a son, and as soon as she is able to, she starts her journey to Alipor, Calcutta, to confront Narendra and ensure a better future for their son. At Rishikesh she is exploited by two women and a man from whom she escapes and takes shelter in a crematorium. Then at Banaras, she is molested by a Pandit, rescued by the police and given a ticket to Calcutta. When she alights en route to get water for her baby, the train leaves, and she falls into the clutches of Manilal who feigns blindness and lures her to a brothel near Banaras, where she is forced to stay so that she can provide for her son. It is here that she is introduced to powerful politician, Bhagwat Choudhary, who pays a hefty sum and asks Manilal to bring Ganga to Calcutta where he intends to keep her as his and Jeeva Sahay's mistress. What Ganga does not know is that Bhagwat's daughter, Radha, is Narendra's bride-to-be; that Jeeva is none other than Narendra's father, and that soon she will be asked to dance at his wedding reception. According to Philip Lutgendorf, the movie is an allegory that \"synthesizes classical and mythic narrative, soft-core political and social commentary (here condemning the corruption of politicians and capitalists and championing the nascent environmental initiatives of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi). The narrative recapitulates the Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntalam story that first appeared in the epic Mahabharata and then was reworked, some six hundred years later, by the poet Kalidasa.\" The movie was a hit, and it earned Mandakini a Filmfare nomination as Best Actress. The film also caused a stir because of two scenes: one in which Mandakini bathes under a waterfall wearing only a flimsy white saree through which her breasts are clearly visible and another in which she is shown breast-feeding a child. Some critics claimed that the scenes were vulgar and exploitative, and were used to get around the Censor Board's stringent rules against nudity. Kapoor, as usual, defended the inclusion of the scenes stating that they were tasteful. The film won five Filmfare Awards. Audio: HMV, Music and Lyrics: Ravindra Jain, except 5 and 9",

The literal meaning of the title can be translated as \"Paint me with the colours of spring\". It features an ensemble cast comprising Aamir Khan, Siddharth Narayan, Soha Ali Khan, Kunal Kapoor, R. Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Atul Kulkarni and British actress Alice Patten in the lead roles. Made on a budget of \u20b9250 million (US$3.9\u00a0million), it was shot in and around New Delhi. Upon release, the film broke all opening box office records in India. It was the highest-grossing film in its opening weekend in India and had the highest opening day collections for a Bollywood film. The film was well received and praised for strong screenplay and dialogues. The story is about a British documentary filmmaker who is determined to make a film on Indian freedom fighters based on diary entries by her grandfather, a former officer of the Indian Imperial Police. Upon arriving in India, she asks a group of five young men to act in her film. Rang De Basanti's release faced stiff resistance from the Indian Defence Ministry and the Animal Welfare Board due to parts that depicted the use of MiG-21 fighter aircraft and a banned Indian horse race. The film was released globally on 26 January 2006, the Republic Day of India, it received critical acclaim winning National award for most popular film. It was subsequently nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2006 BAFTA Awards. Rang De Basanti was chosen as India's official entry for the Golden Globe Awards and the Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category, though it did not ultimately yield a nomination for either award. A. R. Rahman's soundtrack, which earned positive reviews, had two of its tracks considered for an Academy Award nomination. The film was well received by critics and audiences for its production values and had a noticeable influence on Indian society. In India, Rang De Basanti did well at many of the Bollywood awards ceremonies, including a win for Best Movie at the Filmfare Awards. The film was declared \"Blockbuster\" by Box Office India.   A young, struggling British filmmaker Sue McKinley (Alice Patten) comes across the diary of her grandfather, Mr. McKinley (Steven Mackintosh), who served as a jailer in the Imperial Police during the Indian independence movement. Through the diary, she learns about the story of five freedom fighters who were active in the movement: Chandrasekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh, Shivaram Rajguru, Ashfaqulla Khan, and Ram Prasad Bismil. McKinley, in his diary, states that he had met two type of people in his life, those who died without uttering a sound and those who died with lots of anguish, crying over their deaths. McKinley reveals that it was then that he met with the third kind\u00a0\u2014 those who die with a smile on their face. Having decided to make a self-financed documentary film about these revolutionaries, Sue travels to India, with the help of her friend, Sonia (Soha Ali Khan), from the Institute for International Studies at the University of Delhi. After a few unsuccessful auditions in search of the actors, Sue finally casts Sonia's friends, four young men\u00a0\u2013 Daljit \"DJ\" Singh (Aamir Khan), Karan Singhania (Siddharth Narayan), Aslam Khan (Kunal Kapoor) and Sukhi Ram (Sharman Joshi)\u00a0\u2014 to portray the revolutionaries. Though they aren't very enthusiastic at the idea of acting in a film about the independence movement, Sue eventually manages to convince them. Laxman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni), a right-wing political party activist, joins the cast later, despite initially being unpopular due to his anti-Western ideology, due to which he is often at odds with the other four, and anti-Muslim beliefs and contempt for Aslam Khan. In the process of filming, the idealism of India's revolutionary heroes seeps into the protagonists. They gradually begin to realize that their own lives are quite similar to the characters they portray in Sue's film and that the state of affairs that once plagued the revolutionaries continues to torment their generation. Meanwhile, Ajay Singh Rathod (R. Madhavan), a flight lieutenant in the Indian Air Force who is Sonia's fianc\u00e9, is killed when his jet, a MiG-21, crashes. The government proclaims that the crash was caused by pilot error and closes the investigation. Knowing that Rathod was an ace pilot, Sonia and her friends do not accept the official explanation. Instead, they claim that he sacrificed his life to save hundreds of other lives that would have been lost had he ejected from the aircraft and left it to crash into a populous city. They investigate and learn that the crash was due to a corrupt defence minister Shastri (Mohan Agashe), who had signed a contract exchanging cheap and illegal MiG-21 aircraft spare parts for a personal favour. To their surprise, they learn that the key person who was responsible for organizing the deal was Karan's father, Rajnath Singhania (Anupam Kher). Angered by the situation, the group and their supporters decide to protest peacefully at India Gate, a war memorial in New Delhi. Police forcefully break up their protest using batons; in the process, Rathod's mother (Waheeda Rehman) is severely injured and slips into a coma. DJ, Karan, Aslam, Sukhi, and Laxman decide that they must emulate the early freedom fighters and resort to violence to achieve justice. As a result, they kill the defence minister to avenge Rathod's death, while Karan murders his father for his corrupt actions. The minister is reported to have been killed by terrorists and is hailed as a martyr by the media. To bring forth their intentions behind the killings, the five of them attempt to reach the public through a radio station. They forcibly take over the All India Radio station premises after having evacuated its employees. Karan goes on air and reveals the truth about the defence minister and his wrongdoings. While still on the air, the police proclaim that they are dangerous terrorists who have forcefully taken over the AIR, and therefore they are to be shot on sight. The first to be shot is Daljit, who tries to get out of cover and establish that they are not terrorists. Sukhi, unable to control his anger, shows himself and is instantly shot. As they are trying to lock the terrace doors, Aslam and Pandey are then killed by a grenade and the once archenemies die holding hands and smiling, as they have visions of Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan. Daljit manages to crawl to the recording room, where Karan is still on air. When Karan understands that he has been shot, they speak amongst themselves for the last time, regarding the others, about Sue and about Daljit's love for her. They are then killed by police commandos while laughing. It is then revealed that McKinley described the third kind of people he came across as being the ones who embraced death as a friend and an equal, with a heartfelt laughter. After their death, the public reacts with outrage and expresses urge to bring Indian politics to justice, following the motives of all the boys. The film comes to an end with Sue describing the impact of the boys on her life. As she and Sonia watch from the rooftop that Ajay proposed to her on, they have a vision of the boys running in the fields, singing happily and victoriously throwing their shirts in the air, acting as if they are celebrating life itself, as if the ebb of their once-there vitality still reverberates in the places where they once used to go, and a wave of melancholy comes over the two surviving women. In an afterlife-like state, the boys watch as a father tells his son (a young Bhagat Singh) about gardening. They watch over him with smiling faces, then depart as friends for eternity. Rakeysh Mehra took seven years to research and develop the story, including three to write the script. While some raised doubts about his morale following the failure of his last film, Aks, at the box office, he retorted by saying that it would not affect him at all. He added that not only did his storytelling technique improve, but past mistakes had helped him improve his filmmaking abilities. Rakeysh said the following in a scriptwriter's conference conducted by the Film Writers Association in the year 2008, \"I was making a documentary called Mamooli Ram, on the missed revolution with Kamalesh Pandey. We were sitting in a small hotel room in Nanded, drinking. We started singing songs, and we both realised we liked similar songs. And so Rang De Basanti was born. He was angry with the system, I was helpless with the system. We wanted to do so much. But we really can't do anything and it was born out of anger. He wrote a story called Ahuti, meaning sacrifice. Ahuti was about the armed revolution about India, between the years 1919 and 1931. It started with Ashfaqullah Khan, Ramprasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, went on to Chandrashekhar Azad and so on. We had this amazing screenplay called Ahuti, which we had also termed as The Young Guns of India, which started with a train robbery, Azad on a horse and so on. I said, \"let's do The Young Guns of India\". We were going to go on the floor, and suddenly there were a couple of film on Bhagat Singh made. But they came and went. Not because they were good or bad films, not because they were written badly or not written so bad. I'm not being judgmental about them. And this is very important: because they did not reflect the sentiment of today's time. Nobody in the audience could identify with something which was past. It wasn't that there wasn't idea of patriotism in us, but it was sleeping somewhere. And you had to kind of relate to it in today's world. So a couple of bottles of vodka again, and three days later, with couple of vodkas down, Kamlesh ji comes up with 'You know what, I think I've cracked it'.\" Development of Rang De Basanti originated with several ideas Mehra came up with early on but later dropped or greatly evolved into new directions. One of these involved a group of youngsters who worked in an automobile repair shop, while another was about the life of Bhagat Singh, an Indian freedom revolutionary. During this time, he personally conducted a survey with a group of youths in New Delhi and Mumbai about the Indian revolutionaries he was planning on depicting, which indicated that many of youngsters did not recognize the names of some of the most prominent revolutionaries. This led Mehra to believe that the sense of \"patriotism had blurred\" in the young generation. Because of this, he dropped his original plans in favor of a new idea in which a British documentary filmmaker on a visit to India realizes that the local \"kids are more Western than her\". This new story, which eventually formed the basis for Rang De Basanti's script, was influenced by Mehra's upbringing, youth and experiences over the years, including his desire to join the Indian Air Force while in school, as well as his recollections of listening to Independence Day speeches and watching patriotic films such as Mother India. Although Mehra denies that the film is autobiographical, he confessed that the character sketches were loosely inspired by himself and his friends. Mehra approached Angad Paul after having been impressed with his production work on British films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. Paul, who was keen to work in India, liked Mehra's story and agreed to produce the film, bringing with him David Reid and Adam Bohling as executive producers. Despite having no prior knowledge of Hindi cinema, Reid and Bohling's belief in the script was strong enough that they each were willing to work at half their normal rate. While it was originally suggested that language versions of the film would be made concurrently, in English (as Paint it Yellow) and Hindi, the plans for an English version were dropped during development. Mehra believed that English-language version felt alien and that \"one can tell a film in just one language\". After the English version was dropped, the writer Kamlesh Pandey was brought on board to pen the first draft of Rang De Basanti in Hindi, marking the start of his screenwriting career. Thereafter Mehra and co-writer Rensil D'Silva took over the script, working on it for about two years. Prasoon Joshi, the film's lyricist, worked on the dialogue, marking his foray into screenwriting. Rang De Basanti suffered a significant setback when one of the initial producers ultimately failed to contribute any funds towards it; the shortfall left production looking uncertain just two months away from the beginning of principal photography. However, after Aamir Khan agreed to act in the film, Mehra approached Ronnie Screwvala of UTV Motion Pictures with the script. Screwvala, who supported Mehra from the beginning of the production, had faith in the film, reasoning that in historical films, \"the treatment and execution is very different from regular masala fare\", and that such films \"find favour with the audience owing to their elaborate sets and period costumes\". The budget was reported as Rs.\u00a0250\u00a0million (approximately US$5.5\u00a0million), and, despite going a little over the initially planned budget, Mehra did not have any serious disagreements with UTV. Aamir Khan agreed to act in Rang De Basanti immediately after reading Mehra's script. Mehra described his character as a simple man with a strong sense of integrity and dignity. Khan, who would turn 40 during the shoot, lost about 10 kilograms (22\u00a0lb) with a strict diet and exercise regime to more convincingly depict a man in his late twenties. Atul Kulkarni and Kunal Kapoor were publicly attached to the film by the time it was officially announced; Kapoor had been the assistant director to Mehra during the filming of Aks and was already familiar with the material Mehra had been developing. Mehra gave Kulkarni biographies of Ram Prasad Bismil as preparation, including Bismil's autobiography. Early rumors indicated that actors Arjun Rampal and Arjan Bajwa would be amongst the male leads, but these roles ultimately were filled by Sharman Joshi, Siddharth Narayan and R. Madhavan. Rang De Basanti marked Siddharth's Bollywood debut, following on the success of his Telugu film Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana. Having previously worked as an assistant director, Siddharth praised Mehra as being \"by far the most ambitious technical filmmaker in Indian cinema\". Madhavan, despite being a well-known Tamil cinema actor, took the smaller role of a fighter aircraft pilot because he was convinced of the film's potential and wanted to be a part of it. Om Puri appears in a two-scene cameo as Aslam's staunch Muslim father. Soha Ali Khan and Alice Patten immediately became Mehra's clear favorites for each of their roles during casting, which led to Patten flying to Mumbai for a screen test with the entire cast. She was informed that she had won the documentary filmmaker role after she returned home to the United Kingdom. Soha, portraying the pilot's fianc\u00e9e, was filming Rituparna Ghosh's Antarmahal and David Dhawan's comedy Shaadi No. 1 concurrently with her work in Rang De Basanti. In particular, the demands of her emotional scenes in Antarmahal often left her exhausted, thus requiring \"a lot of personal overhauling\" to ensure that her performance in Rang De Basanti was unaffected. During filming, reports indicated that co-stars Siddharth and Soha had become romantically involved with each other. Alongside the two lead actresses, Lakh Tandon played the role of Aamir's Grand Father and Kirron Kher played the mother of Khan's character. The film, which was shot in New Delhi, Mumbai, Rajasthan and Punjab, was officially launched at a hotel on 1 February 2005. When shooting began, Mehra made an announcement to his crew saying that they would enjoy their holiday only in July. Instead of filming at the actual locations from the script, other locations were selected for picturisation. One such scene is where Soha Ali Khan is filmed at the India Habitat Center that masquerades as the University of Delhi. On similar lines, New Delhi's Modern School at Barakhamba Road served as the location for all the scenes pertinent to All India Radio station, which is shown to be stormed by the youngsters in the film. The Delhi Tourism department was happy to encourage filming in the city if it helped promote tourism, though any filming near India Gate was prohibited due to the ensuing bureaucratic paperwork. Similar issues with bureaucracy were faced by Mehra while filming at the Jaipur Fort. To use a historical location for filming, they had to seek permissions of seven officials ranging from the local police to the Archaeological Survey of India office. Nahargarh Fort, which oversees the city of Jaipur, was another such historical location where one of the songs was filmed. Besides these locations, the filming was also done at Amritsar's Harmandir Sahib Gurudwara. For Aamir Khan, a Muslim, it was for the first time that he was playing a North Indian Punjabi character and it took him some time to get the right dialect and diction. While speaking about his experience of visiting the Gurudwara for the first time, he said: It's one of the most peaceful places I've been to. As you enter the place there's a certain serenity that surrounds you. I really enjoyed being there. The first shot we took was of our feet entering the water just as you pass the doorway of the temple. The water was cold but it was great! Once the locations were finalized, the team of Lovleen Bains and Arjun Bhasin was chosen for designing the look of Rang De Basanti. Bhasin had previously worked on Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love (1996) and Dil Chahta Hai (2001), the latter of which featured Aamir Khan, and he was referred to Mehra by Khan due to their previous association. Since the film's plot focused on men in their late twenties, Bhasin designed their look accordingly. Although he was responsible for Khan's rebellious look, Sharman Joshi's (who played Sukhi) lovable persona or Madhavan's dignified appearance, Bhasin credited Bains for her major contributions to the film. Khan's hair was styled by Avan Contractor, who came up with soft curls falling over Khan's forehead. This new look, which took Contractor one hour to come up with, surprised the audience at the film's launch. In post-production, the visual effects were handled by Tata Elxsi's Visual Computing Labs. The military aircraft they created was so realistic that the Indian Air Force called to check the producer's permission of using an actual MiG-21. The soundtrack of Rang De Basanti, which was released by Sony BMG, featured music composed by A. R. Rahman and lyrics penned by Prasoon Joshi and Blaaze, an India-based rapper. From the film's announcement in April 2005, Rahman was slated to compose the music. In a press conference with pop singer Nelly Furtado, he said that she was to originally have featured on the soundtrack, although this was ultimately prevented from happening due to a change in producers and other factors. Aamir Khan, with his knowledge of Hindi and Urdu, worked with Rahman and Joshi for the soundtrack. In addition, Mehra and Rahman chose him to sing for one of the songs. Joshi, one of the lyricists, was impressed with the director, Rakeysh Mehra, who was ready to adjust to his style of writing as well as his creativity. Confessing that the film's soundtrack was his favorite out of all his previous works, Joshi felt that it \"was a wonderful experience getting to know the mindset of today's youth and to pen down their feelings\". Speaking about one of his songs, \"Luka Chuppi\", in which veteran Lata Mangeshkar sang with Rahman, Joshi said that it was developed while discussing with Rahman the scene about a mother losing her son. Joshi wrote the lyrics about the mother and son playing hide-and-seek with the sad reality of the son being hidden forever. He confessed to have been in tears while Mangeshkar was singing the song. The soundtrack won the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director, and had two of its tracks, Khalbali and Luka Chuppi, considered for an Academy Award for Best Original Song nomination. While discussing typical Bollywood soundtracks, Nilanjana Bhattacharjya, a professor of music at Colorado College, noted that Rahman integrated traditional Punjabi cultural elements within his music for this soundtrack. Regionally defined elements such as a woman's prayer at the Sikh Gurdwara (Golden Temple) and the bhangra harvest dance are incorporated alongside more contemporary, global styles such as hard rock and hip hop to depict the cosmopolitan lifestyle of the youngsters in the film. Rang De Basanti received its world premiere on 26 January 2006, with high expectations that it would be a success with western audiences, though it also faced ire from several organizations because of certain controversial scenes. The film contained scenes of a MiG-21, a controversial aircraft in the Indian Air Force, which has a long history of fatal accidents in India. Promptly, the Indian Defence Ministry raised concerns, causing the Indian censor board to urge the filmmakers to seek clearance from the ministry. Accordingly, Khan and Mehra screened the film for the then Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee along with other top officials from the armed forces. One Air Force official reportedly said that it was \"not a review, but a preview\". After the special screening, the defence ministry did not insist on any cuts, but on their recommendation more names were added to the slide that dedicates the film to deceased MiG pilots. After this clearance, the Animal Welfare Board raised objections on the use of animals in the film. Although the filmmakers had obtained a No Objection Certificate from the board officials, Maneka Gandhi, a well-known animal rights activist and member of the welfare board, found flaws in this certificate. Subsequently, this certificate was revoked and with only a few days left for the world premiere, Mehra personally requested Gandhi to reconsider her objection. After another viewing, the board cleared their objection stating that the use of animals in the film was natural and justified. However, after they recommended the deletion of a 20-second scene that depicted a banned horse race conducted by the Nihang Sikhs, the filmmakers deleted this scene. Mrs. Kavita Gadgil whose son, late Flight Lieutenant Abhijeet Gadgil was killed when his MiG-21 fighter crashed, objected to the film's release because she believed that the film was loosely based on her son's life and the producers should have shown her the film. In response, Kamlesh Pandey, one of the writers of the film, said that the film was not inspired by Abhijeet Gadgil. The film was screened at several international film festivals. In 2006, it premiered in France with the Lyon Asiexpo Film Festival, the Wisconsin Film Festival and the Morocco-based International Film Festival of Marrakech. As a part of the publicity, the cast, visited prominent University campuses in New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Pune with an intention of interacting with the students. After hiring international experts for the film's publicity, the marketing expenditure for the film grew to 40 percent of the total production budget of \u20b9250 million (US$3.9\u00a0million). This expenditure was unprecedented in Bollywood because usually the Indian filmmakers spend only about five percent of their production budget on marketing. Out of the \u20b9100 million (US$1.5\u00a0million) marketing campaign, a fifth of it came from the producers while the rest was obtained through brand tie-ups and partnering. Since Rahman's last musical success, Saathiya, was back in 2002, there were high expectations from the soundtrack in the media. The soundtrack, first released commercially in early December 2005, generally received above average reviews. One of the songs, \"Masti Ki Paatshaala\" (translation: \"Classroom of Fun\"), was voted as the \"Song of the year\" for 2006 by leading Indian television channels, while two compositions were considered for an Academy Award nomination. Before its theatrical release, the producers tied up with several top brands to help in the marketing the film. An alliance was formed with The Coca-Cola Company by releasing special edition bottles to commemorate the film's release, a first of its kind in Bollywood. Besides this, the music CDs and cassettes were co-branded with the cola company along with the launch of the sale of collectibles from the film. Provogue, a well-known clothing retail chain in India, launched a special limited edition clothing merchandise targeting the youth of India. Besides these, the producers collaborated with LG Group, Berger Paints, Bharti Airtel and Hindustan Petroleum. The producers tied up with several media partners such as MSN India, Channel V and Radio Mirchi to further enhance their marketing efforts. A video game launched by an Indian mobile content company was based on an adaptation of the film's plot. In India, The Hindu reported that with audiences from the metropolitan cities turning out in large numbers, Rang De Basanti was notching up record collections in its opening week. Accordingly, 55 percent of the film's revenues came from multiplexes in these cities. While the opening week box-office collections from Mumbai, the home of Bollywood, were reported to be over \u20b940 million (US$620,000), theaters in New Delhi earned about half of Mumbai's revenue. Throughout the country, the cumulative collections in the first week was about \u20b980 million (US$1.2\u00a0million). Overseas collections from the United States, United Kingdom and Australia were collectively put at over \u20b960 million (US$930,000) for the same week. Released in about 60 theaters in the United States, the film grossed \u20b931 million (US$480,000) in its opening weekend and earned \u20b999 million (US$1.5\u00a0million) within 10 weeks. With \u20b91.23 billion (US$19\u00a0million) alone coming from the Indian territory, the film earned more than \u20b91.36 billion (US$21\u00a0million) worldwide. Currently, the film holds the record for the highest-grossing film to be released in January. Within a week of the film's theatrical release, illegal copies of the film priced at \u20b910 million (US$150,000) were seized at an Indian airport. A report carried out by The Times of India highlighted copyright infringement on the Internet where movies like Rang De Basanti could be downloaded freely. The DVD release sold more than 70,000 copies over six months, and as a result the film was the highest selling title at the time of its release. Rang De Basanti was released on Blu-ray (plus steelbook edition) in May 2014. Critics gave the film an overwhelmingly positive response, in particular the ensemble cast's performance and credibility. Although The Indian Express spoke positively of the cinematography and the film's story, it noted that \"the message that the film carries with it tends to get diluted towards the climax. Praising the film's cast for their performance and the cinematography of Binod Pradhan, Taran Ardash wrote that the film would be successful with the urban audiences. The Hindustan Times summarized the film as being a \"well-scripted, skilfully crafted [and] thought-provoking entertainer\". Saisuresh Sivaswamy of Rediff.com wrote that films like Rang De Basanti can easily get into \"preachiness\", but believed Mehra got his message across while avoiding this, also appreciating the music, cinematography, dialogues and art direction. The Hindu credited Kamlesh Pandey for writing a story that would have been a difficult film to make, but it added by saying that the transformation of the youngsters into heroes seemed poetic. Although the screenplay, direction and the cast were also well-appreciated, the reviewer felt that Rahman's soundtrack lacked pace. The film also received positive reviews from critics outside India. The review from the BBC gave it the highest possible five star rating and added that it was \"an entertaining mix of romance, history and social commentary\". The Bloomberg website wrote positively about \"the raw energy of a young cast and A. R. Rahman's splendidly rousing soundtrack\". Sight & Sound magazine conducts a poll every ten years of the world's finest film directors to find out the Ten Greatest Films of All Time. This poll has been going since 1992, and has become the most recognised poll of its kind in the world. In 2012 Cyrus Frisch voted for \"Rang De Basanti\". Frisch commented: \"Corruption became the subject of fierce debate in India after the major success of this film among youngsters.\" A major point of criticism the film faced was regarding the possibility of Army attacking students in a radio station. When Rakeysh was questioned about the same in a scriptwriter's conference conducted by the Film Writers Association in the year 2008, he said the following, \"So, in 2005, in Allahabad, a bunch of 4 students took the TV station there, and they were shot dead. Everything I did, it was kind of was kind of borrowed, as I said right here. Obviously, what I am also learning is the way I tell a story is not real; you can term it as a-real. For maximum impact, for the message to go through, I felt\u2014since the story was against the establishment\u2014let the establishment do it. After all, the establishment did hang Bhagat Singh. After all, the establishment did come down on the innocent, innocent students in Mandal Commission. After all the establishment did come down on Tiananmen Square. After all the establishment did come down when the whole concept of Flower Power emerged in America. So it's all there. It's borrowed, maybe not as realistically, but it is definitely there in the society. During emergency, there are horror stories. If we have to go back to Kriplani and his movement in Bihar, the stories are absolutely horrific.\" Since the film \"reflected contemporary Indian reality and had cinematic excellence\", it was chosen as India's official entry for the 79th Academy Awards despite stiff competition from films such as Krrish, Omkara, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and Lage Raho Munna Bhai. While discussing if the selection committee's choice was correct, critics felt that the Academy members could have better related with Omkara, an adaptation of Shakespeare's play Othello. Despite these qualms and Mehra's belief that his film did not stand a chance at the Oscars, the efforts to publicize the film in the United States began earnestly. Music composer A. R. Rahman performed several concerts across the East Coast to promote the film. Besides his efforts, producer Screwvala planned to use resources and expertise from his partners in 20th Century Fox and Walt Disney Pictures for organizing its publicity efforts. When the nominations in the foreign film category did not feature this film, it sparked off debates on whether the film should have been India's entry for the Oscars. In one such debate on a television channel that involved Screwvala, the selection committee was questioned about its knowledge of the requisite artistic criteria for such award ceremonies. While one outcome of the debate was on how Omkara would have been a better choice, the other discussed the West-centric sensibilities of the Academy members. However, results from a simultaneously conducted SMS poll indicated that 62 percent felt that the film was the right choice for the Oscars.  The film was also nominated for the Best Film not in English language at the 2007 British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards. Rang De Basanti had a noticeable impact on Indian society. A study of bloggers behavioral patterns during the first month of the film's release revealed a significant increase in public ire towards government and politicians for constantly being mired in corruption and bureaucracy and their inefficiency in providing basic amenities. Intense political discussions spurred on by the film's influence were observed in these patterns. While commenting on this, writer D'Silva said that the film \"has struck a chord somewhere\". Besides instigating political thought and discussions, it evoked social awakening for many. Some discussions rallied on how citizens should support and contribute to non-governmental organizations and exercising simple citizen duties of paying taxes and voting, while the others contemplated on how to become more responsible towards the country. Unlike other Indian films with jingoistic overtones, many young Indians could relate well to the characters of this film. While such reactions were observed on the Internet, youth activism took to streets to protest on public interest issues. A direct impact was on the 1999 Jessica Lall Murder Case, one of the high-profile murder cases in India. A month after the film's release, a court acquitted the main accused because of inefficient prosecution and hostile witnesses. This sparked intense civil protests and media campaigns that sought his re-arrest. Taking cue from the scene in which the protagonists hold a silent, candlelight vigil at New Delhi's India Gate, one such group of demonstrators carried out a similar rally to voice their protest. Shortly thereafter, a survey was conducted to assess reasons for the sudden upsurge in people's social involvements. Eighteen percent of the respondents felt that movies like Rang De Basanti were the main reason behind it. Another such massive youth activism was seen in the Priyadarshini Mattoo rape and murder case where similar rallies were organized in India, United States and around the world. Following the release of the film, another social outcry was against the introduction of reservations for socially backward classes in educational institutions. Young doctors and engineers joined hands in peaceful rallies in major cities across India. Though the film was not released in the neighbouring Pakistan, it evoked similar reactions there. Inspired by the film, Pakistan's national newspaper, Jang, launched a television channel that was to focus on citizens' issues and support public awakening. Reacting to these strong social reactions, actor Kunal Kapoor thought that the film was just a catalyst that presented \"patriotism in a package that the youngsters understood and empathised with\". In the Indian media, frequent referencing of the film was evident, with many brands using pictorials from the movie. In addition, the media also uses the terms \"RDB\" (abbreviated title of the movie) and \"RDB effect\" while referring to instances of public activism on matters of public interest. When the 2007 University of Delhi Student Elections focused more on the important issues facing the students than in the previous years, one student referred to this as the \"RDB Syndrome\". On similar lines, Kamal Sunavala wrote a play titled Under the Influence which focuses on a young Indian expatriate whose life changes after watching this film.",

        "full_text": " Rangeela (English\u00a0: Colorful) is a 1995 Indian romantic comedy drama film written, directed and produced by Ram Gopal Varma. The film starred Aamir Khan, Jackie Shroff and Urmila Matondkar in pivotal roles. The film was A. R. Rahman's debut Hindi film with an original score and soundtrack, as his previous Hindi releases were dubbed versions of his Tamil, Malayalam and Telugu films. The blockbuster film received critical acclaim, and was screened at the mainstream section of International Film Festival of India. The film was later remade in Hollywood as Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!. The film won seven filmfare awards that year. They were: Best actor in supporting role - Jackie Shroff, Best choreography - Ahmed Khan, Best Costume Designing - Manish Malhotra, Best Story - Ram Gopal Varma, Best Music - A R Rahman, the RD Burman Award - Mehboob, and a Special Jury Award - Asha Bhosle for \"Tanha Tanha\".   A street-toughened orphan by the name of Munna (Aamir Khan) is befriended by some kind folks, whose effervescent daughter Mili (Urmila Matondkar) soon grows to be his best buddy. Both gravitate toward the Mumbai movie industry. While Mili finds occupation as a movie extra, Munna earns his livelihood selling movie tickets in the black market. Mili has ambitions of becoming an actress. Fortune glances her way, when she dances her way into a movie star's attentions. This actor, Raj Kamal (Jackie Shroff), arranges for her to be auditioned for the heroine's role in his upcoming movie called Rangeela. Mili's shortcomings amount to distractions, but thanks in no small way to Munna and Raj, she lands the role. Raj and Munna both fall for Mili, but Mili is too busy making the movie to notice any of this. She starts spending a lot of time with Raj during the filming. Munna tries many times to tell Mili that he loves her, but he is unable to, or Raj gets in the way. Eventually, feeling inferior, Munna decides to leave Mili to Raj, who can give her a better life than he can. The matter is not resolved though, as Mili hears of this on the film's opening night. She asks Raj to help her find Munna, which he does after realizing that Mili seems to love Munna and not him. Mili stops Munna in the midway, misunderstandings get cleared and the lovers unite. Rangeela opened with a positive response and was declared a Super-hit in the box office, grossing over 210\u00a0million. It was also the fourth biggest grosser of 1995. Urmila Matondkar became an overnight sensation, and her fame was bolstered by hits like 'Tanha Tanha' and 'Rangeela Re'. Her designer Manish Malhotra also received instant fame. The movie proved to be a turning point for Aamir's career, whose chemistry with Urmila was also appreciated. The choreography of 'Rangeela' also deserves a special mention. The amazing dance sequences led by choreographers Ahmed Khan and Saroj Khan were considered classic and appealing. Rangeela's music was also highly successful that helped the film to achieve victory at the box office. The film was highly successful at the box office. Box Office India declared it a 'Blockbuster'. The soundtrack featured 7 songs composed by A. R. Rahman with lyrics penned by Mehboob and an instrumental theme song. The audio was released in September 1995 by Rahman's mother Kareema and the soundtrack proved immensely popular upon release. It is listed in almost all lists of best Bollywood soundtracks. The soundtrack fetched Rahman two filmfare awards, Filmfare Best Music Director Award and Filmfare RD Burman Award for New Music Talent. Mehboob got two nominations for Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist, for the tracks \"Kya Kare\" and \"Tanha Tanha\". Shweta Shetty and Kavita Krishnamurthy were nominated for Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer for their respective tracks. Rangeela marked the return of the then 62-year-old veteran playback singer Asha Bhosle, who sang two super hit songs for the movie. Asha, like her sister Lata Mangeshkar, had long retired from accepting playback singer awards, but she received the Filmfare Special Award that year for her rendition of the song \"Tanha Tanha\". The song \"Yaaro Sun Lo Zara\" was originally composed for a Telugu film Super Police as \"Baabu Love Cheyyara\". The soundtrack was also released in Tamil, with title Rangeela itself and lyrics penned by Vairamuthu. However, the reused track \"Yaaro Sun Lo Zara\" was not included in the Tamil version. Compact Cassettes are the only media to enjoy audio tracks during those days in INDIA. TIME AUDIO company launched the audio cassettes of this movie for Rs 36 only. The cassettes sold like hot cakes during those days. It is very unfortunate that VINYL industry had closed its door just 2 years back of this movie release. Otherwise every one had enjoyed the movie songs in VINYL discs too. But now Audio CD's and MP3's are available to listen to this evergreen album. The soundtrack rights are now acquired by Tips Music Company.",

        "full_text": " Gauri Khan, Ra.One is a 2011 Indian science fiction superhero film directed by Anubhav Sinha, and starring Shah Rukh Khan, Arjun Rampal, Kareena Kapoor, Armaan Verma, Shahana Goswami and Tom Wu in pivotal roles.The script, written by Anubhav Sinha and Kanika Dhillon, originated as an idea that Anubhav Sinha got when he saw a television commercial, and which he subsequently expanded. The film follows Shekhar Subramanium (Shah Rukh Khan), a game designer who creates a motion sensor-based game in which the antagonist (Ra.One) is more powerful than the protagonist (G.One). The former escapes from the game's virtual world and enters the real world; his aim is to kill Lucifer, the game ID of Shekhar's son and the only player to have challenged Ra.One's power. Relentlessly pursued, the family is forced to bring out G.One from the virtual world to defeat Ra.One and protect them. Principal photography began in March 2010 and took place in India and the United Kingdom, and was overseen by an international crew. The post-production involved 3-D conversion and the application of visual effects, the latter being recognised as a technological breakthrough among Indian films. With a budget of \u20b9150 crore (US$23\u00a0million), inclusive of publicity costs, Ra.One was one of the most expensive Indian films at the time of release. The producers spent \u20b9150 crore (US$23\u00a0million) out of a \u20b952 crore (US$8.0\u00a0million) marketing budget, which involved a nine-month publicity campaign, brand tie-ups, merchandise, video games and viral marketing. Ra.One was initially scheduled to release on 3 June 2011, but delays due to a lengthy post-production process and escalating costs pushed back the release date. The film also faced controversies involving plagiarism, content leaks and copyright challenges. Consequently, Ra.One was theatrically released on 26 October 2011, the beginning of the five-day Diwali weekend, in 2D, 3D and dubbed versions, with three international premieres being held between October 24 & 26, 2011. The film witnessed the largest international theatrical release for an Indian film as of 2011, and was preceded by high audience and commercial expectations. Upon release, Ra.One received mixed reviews, with critics praising the visuals and music, but criticising the script and direction. Commercially, the film became the third highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2011 domestically, the highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2011 worldwide, and broke a number of opening box office records, though it managed to sustain at the box office after its extended opening weekend. As the film earned more than Rs 170 crores it was considered as a superhit film as the distributors recovered their investment. The film subsequently won a number of awards for its technical aspects, notably one National Film Award, one Filmfare Award and four International Indian Film Academy Awards.   Jenny Nair (Shahana Goswami), an employee of London-based company Barron Industries, introduces a new technology that allows objects from the digital world to enter the real world using the wireless transmissions from multiple devices. Shekhar Subramanium (Shah Rukh Khan), a game designer who also works at Barron Industries, has delivered a number of commercial failures; an irate Barron (Dalip Tahil) gives him his last chance to develop a successful game. To impress his sceptical son Prateek (Armaan Verma), and upon the request of his wife Sonia (Kareena Kapoor), Shekhar uses his son's idea that the antagonist should be more powerful than the protagonist. His colleague, computer programmer Jenny uses Shekhar's face as a model for that of the game's protagonist G.One (Shah Rukh Khan) (Technically Good One and in Hindi Jeevan, which means life), while the shape-shifting antagonist Ra.One (Technically Random Access Version One and in Hindi Ravan, a mythical demon) is made faceless. Another colleague, Akashi (Tom Wu), implements the characters' movements. The game, named Ra.One, contains three levels, the final level being the only one in which either character can be killed. Each character possesses a special device \u2013 the H.A.R.T (Hertz Amplifying Resonance Transmitter) which gives them their powers. Upon reaching the last level, the characters gain a gun with one bullet; the other character can be killed by this bullet but only if his H.A.R.T is attached. When Ra.One undergoes final tests, Akashi notices unusual glitches but chooses to ignore them. When the game is officially launched, it receives a standing ovation from the audience; an enamored Prateek insists on playing it immediately. He logs in under the ID Lucifer and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by Akashi. Ra.One, unable to end his turn with Lucifer and angry that a player has proceeded so far, becomes determined that Lucifer will die. He uses a wireless technology (which Jenny had introduced in a conference) to enter the real world, a process which causes the mainframe to malfunction. Akashi informs Shekhar, who partially understands the situation and rushes home, fearing for his son's life. Meanwhile, Ra.One murders Akashi and assumes his appearance; he goes to find Lucifer, and meets Shekhar in the process. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer, but his lie is exposed when Ra.One scans his identity card. Consequently, Ra.One kills Shekhar and makes it look like a car accident. Sonia, devastated after Shekhar's death, tells Prateek that the family will return to India after Shekhar's funeral. A suspicious Prateek notices digital patterns on the fateful road and realises that Ra.One has come to life. He convinces Jenny of the same when they see the destroyed game laboratory, and the latter tries to bring G.One into the real world. Meanwhile, Ra.One, having taken the form of Akashi, kills Akashi's mother viciously at his family home and chases the family on their way to the airport, but G.One enters the real world and causes a gas explosion which temporarily destroys Ra.One. G.One takes Ra.One's H.A.R.T. and accompanies the family to Mumbai after Sonia realises that she needs him. Subsequently, Ra.One returns to life, takes the form of a billboard model (Arjun Rampal), and tracks down G.One to Prateek's birthday party. Hypnotising Sonia, he assumes her form to kidnap Prateek. Ra.One then instructs G.One to give him his H.A.R.T. back, and sends the real Sonia in a malfunctioning local train. The train crashes into the Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus, but G.One saves Sonia and others in time. To save Prateek, he returns to the virtual world and fights Ra.One; both reach the third level, the former left with little power. G.One tricks Ra.One into shooting him without his H.A.R.T. attached, leaving Ra.One helpless; furious, the latter creates ten copies of himself. Prateek, unable to identify the real Ra.One, asks G.One to quote Shekhar: \"If you join the forces of evil, its shadows shall always follow you\". The duo realise that only one of the ten Ra.Ones has a shadow: the original one. G.One shoots and destroys him, absorbs Ra.One's remains and disappears. Six months later, Prateek and Sonia return to London, where the former manages to restore G.One to the real world. The major characters of Ra.One were played by protagonists Shahrukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor, and primary antagonist Arjun Rampal. Supporting roles were played by Tom Wu, Shahana Goswami and child artist Armaan Verma. The film featured cameo appearances by Rajinikanth playing the Enthiran character Chitti, Sanjay Dutt and Priyanka Chopra, the latter two being characters in a dream sequence. Additional minor roles were played by Dalip Tahil and Satish Shah, and an important voice-over was provided by Amitabh Bachchan. Khan performed both as Shekhar and G.One. The titular character Ra.One was enacted by three actors \u2013 Rampal, Wu and Kapoor, signifying the character's shape-shifting ability. Khan was the first actor to be cast in the film. Three actors had initially been considered for the lead female role; Kapoor was ultimately chosen because she insisted on playing the part. Rampal accepted the role of Ra.One after Sinha expressed a strong desire to cast him in the film. Wu was contracted to the film in July 2010, and Goswami was cast one month later. Bachchan agreed to be a part of the film after being requested by Khan and Sinha. Several cast members prepared extensively for their roles; Rampal and Kapoor followed special diets to lose weight, and Verma learnt capoeira. Khan and Verma performed their own stunts, and Kapoor subsequently did so as well despite initial reluctance. However, the cast did encounter problems during production. Khan faced difficulties with his superhero suit and prosthetic makeup, and injured his left knee. The decision to cast Rampal was met with scepticism due to \"questionable acting abilities,\" a statement Sinha criticised. In addition, Rampal encountered back problems (which were treated by the time production began), prompting speculation of a possible replacement by Vivek Oberoi. Jackie Chan had initially been approached for the role of Akashi, but he declined the offer. Rajnikanth suffered from health problems which caused a delay in the filming of his cameo appearance. Dutt faced a scheduling conflict with Agneepath (2012), which was later resolved. \"Ra.One is the modern, new age technology version of our mythological \"Raavan,\" who was a mixture of ten different evil characters. I am essaying the role of G.One or better say \"Jeevan,\" a superhero who saves the mankind from Ra.One's torment. Through this film, I want to prove that Indian superheroes can also be as cool as the international ones.\" According to director Anubhav Sinha, the idea of Ra.One originated when he saw an advertisement on television which showed children remotely controlling a human. He was attracted to the concept and wrote a script based on it. Sinha then approached Khan, who liked the story and decided to produce the film under his production company Red Chillies Entertainment. Sinha was apprehensive of retaining Khan's support after the former's previous film Cash (2007) became a commercial failure, but Khan reportedly \"remained unchanged\". Shahrukh Khan felt that the film possessed significant commercial potential, in addition to being a fulfilment of his \"childhood dream\" to be a superhero and to fly. He stated that he wanted to \"make a film that gives me the right to deserve the iconic status that I've got for 20 years.\" He also said that he wanted to make a film dedicated to father-son relationships, which were, in his opinion, \"neglected\" in Bollywood. Khan's idea was to make a simple family drama which expanded into an action film. He declined to make the film in English to increase its appeal for Western audiences, feeling that \"cracking Hollywood on their terms\" was unnecessary. Both Khan and Sinha credited their children for providing encouragement, and regularly \"approving\" the film's execution. Red Chillies Entertainment continued to work on other projects before finalising the production aspects of Ra.One. After providing the visual effects for My Name Is Khan (2010), the studio focused solely on Ra.One and did not take up any other films. Khan initially approached a number of directors to helm the film, including Aditya Chopra and Karan Johar, but they declined; eventually, Sinha was made the film's director. To prepare the film's premises and characterisation, Sinha spent several months viewing video clips, digital art portals and comic books. Sinha and Khan also watched around 200 superhero films from all over the world. The storyboards were designed by Atul Chouthmal, who was contracted after he met Khan at Yash Raj Studios. While the former began work on the storyboards, the producers hired a storyboard artist from Hollywood. Chouthmal revealed that Khan and the other artist differed on their visions of the film, and so he was brought back. Before filming, Khan reportedly took tips from actor Kamal Hassan regarding the production of large-scale films, having been impressed by Hassan's Dasavathaaram (2008). \"I have always felt this \u2013 and even Alfred Hitchcock said that in a movie, which has a larger than life hero, the villain's role should be very strong. So, I [also] felt [that] if the villain looks good, the superhero will also look good.\" The title of the film received significant media attention due to it being the name of the antagonist rather than the protagonist. The move was considered innovative, and noted as a sign of the \"rising importance of the villain in Bollywood.\" According to Sinha, the title had not been planned as such, and was ultimately chosen because Ra.One \"sounded cooler\" than G.One. Khan was advised to name the film after his own character; he declined to do so, citing the inter-dependence between good and evil. He also called Alfred Hitchcock as his inspiration, and pointed out that the antagonists in films like Sholay, Mr. India and Sadak were better remembered than the protagonists. The crew of Ra.One featured both Indian and overseas personnel. Nicola Pecorini served as the director of photography, with V. Manikandan providing assistance. Andy Gill and Spiro Razatos were hired as the stunt supervisors, and Nino Pansini was hired as the stunt cinematographer. Sabu Cyril and Marcus Wookey were responsible for the production design. The film's producer was Bobby Chawla, but Gauri Khan later stepped in after the former suffered a brain haemorrhage. Filming took place at a number of studios, notably Filmistan Studios, Film City and Yash Raj Studios in India and the Black Hangar Studios in the UK. Principal photography was initially set to begin in Miami, but the idea was abandoned due to budget constraints. The first phase of filming began in Goa on 21 March 2010 and continued until May. The second and third phases took place in London with the entire cast, beginning in July 2010 and ending in August. The next phase was split into two schedules; the first schedule commenced at Filmistan Studios in the first week of September 2010, while the second schedule began in December 2010 and took place over a seven-day period. The remaining portions were filmed in July 2011 at Film City. A cameo appearance and a music video were filmed in the weeks leading up to the release, the former at the Whistling Woods Studios in Mumbai. Ra.One featured three major action sequences, which were filmed in sets and real locations across Mumbai and London. The cinematography borrowed ideas from video games, such as rapid transitions between first-person and third-person perspectives. Procedures such as bullet time were also incorporated into the film. The production design was closely associated with the lighting and cinematography to facilitate smooth filming. However, filming faced a number of difficulties including increasing costs, delays and safety constraints. In addition, differences between Khan and Sinha caused tensions on the sets. As with the filming crew, the post-production crew of the film included both Indian and overseas personnel. Prime Focus carried out the film's 3-D conversion, with London-based colorist Richard Fearon performing the color grading. Red Chillies VFX partnered with a number of visual effects studios around the world, and undertook the incorporation of the visual effects under the supervision of Jeffrey Kleiser. Nvidia provided the information technology\u2013based software utilised for the effects, while Edwark Quirk supervised over the computer-generated imagery used in the film. Resul Pookutty was responsible for the film's sound design. The idea for converting the film to 3-D was put forth during filming, and was implemented in July 2011 due to a revived interest in 3-D films. The process required 2,600 artists to convert 4,400 shots of the film. The sound design involved bridging the real and the virtual world, and the required sound enhancements were achieved by using the Dolby Surround 7.1 system. Incorporating the visual effects began in April 2010, and was preceded by extensive research. 1,200 artists worked for 2\u00bd years to complete the visual effects work. A number of complex procedures were executed, including cubical transformations and the design of the faceless form of Ra.One. Despite precautions, the post-production faced significant delays owing to the digital inter-mediation, increased work-load due to the 3-D and dubbed versions of the film, and delays in the completion of the visual effects. The post-production also faced budget constraints and witnessed an overuse of CGI according to the cinematographer. The delays left only two days for printing the film and sending it to theatres, generating significant anxiety over a possible delay in the release. Khan subsequently kept strict tabs on the progress of work, and postponed his knee surgery to complete the film on time. The body suits worn by Khan and Rampal were designed by Robert Kurtzman and Tim Flattery, and made by a team of specialists based in Los Angeles. Sinha spent around three months conceptualising the costumes, watching various superhero films to design a costume not created already. He then wrote a 23-page document with his sketches and details of what he wanted, and gave it to the designers to work upon. To create the suit, Khan was required to enter a small chamber where a warm latex-like liquid was released up to his neck and allowed to solidify, forming the mould which was then peeled off his body. The suit was joined by a concealed zipper and subsequently modified. Computer-generated embellishments such as light beams and electricity were added to the suits after Khan expressed dissatisfaction with the initial rushes of the film. A total of 21 costumes were made for the film, with each suit reportedly costing \u20b910 million (US$150,000). Khan's suit was made of reinforced latex, coloured steel-blue and fitted with micro-computer circuitry. Rampal's suit was made of three-inch thick solid rubber, and was red in color. Both actors were required to wear additional suits inside their body suits to prevent skin contact. Wearing the suits created a number of difficulties for the actors. It took 20 minutes to put on the suits and 40 minutes to remove them. In addition, the non-porous nature of the suits created intense heat inside, causing excessive perspiration despite the presence of special air conditioning ducts. Khan later felt that the suits' conception had been a mistake since filming occurred during the day; digital adjustments to the suits brought \"all the efforts to naught.\" Manish Malhotra designed the look and the costume of Kareena Kapoor for the song \"Chammak Challo\", which received widespread media coverage. Kapoor wore a red sari draped in the style of a dhoti. Since the release of the song, the costume was termed a \"fashion rage,\" becoming popular in India and some overseas countries. Fashion experts applauded the costume and Kapoor's ability to carry it off \"stunningly,\" though certain experts dismissed the naming of the sari color. The soundtrack of Ra.One was composed by Vishal-Shekhar, with the lyrics being written by Atahar Panchi, Vishal Dadlani and Kumaar. A. R. Rahman provided the background score for a single sequence. Sinha announced that R&B singer Akon and the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra would be a part of the soundtrack; the former lent his vocals for \"Chammak Challo\" and \"Criminal\", while the latter performed in \"Bhare Naina\". The composers obtained the official license to use Ben E. King's \"Stand By Me,\" on which they based the song \"Dildaara.\" The soundtrack contains fifteen tracks, including seven original songs, four remixes, three instrumentals and an international version of \"Chammak Challo\". The music rights were bought by T-Series for \u20b9150 million (US$2.3\u00a0million). The Hindi version of the soundtrack was released on 12 September 2011; the Tamil and Telugu versions were released on 10 October 2011, featuring six tracks each. In India, the Hindi version of Ra.One was released across more than 4,000 plus screens worldwide- 3,100 screens in 2,100 theatres, breaking the record for the widest Bollywood release previously held by Bodyguard (2011). The Tamil and Telugu versions were released on 275 prints and 125 prints respectively. A week before the release, multiplex owners throughout India decided to allot 95% of the total available screen space to the film. Overseas, Ra.One was released in 904 prints. This including 600 prints in Germany, 344 prints in the USA, 200\u2013300 prints in South Korea, 202 prints in the UK, 79 prints in the Middle East, 75 prints in Russia, 51 prints in Australia, 49 prints in Canada and 25 prints in New Zealand and Taiwan. In early October 2011, a partnership deal was being finalised by the distributors to allow the film to be released in China across 1,000 prints. In addition, the film was released in Pakistan and non-traditional territories like Brazil, Spain, Italy, Greece and Hong Kong. The 3D version was released in 550 screens across the world. Ra.One was noted for the extensive use of digital prints, reportedly making up 50\u201360% of the total release; in India, the film was exhibited in over 1,300 digital theatres, breaking the record previously held by Bodyguard. The wide digital release was implemented to lower distribution costs, make the film accessible to a wider audience and reduce piracy. However, despite the measures taken, pirated versions of Ra.One were available on the Internet within hours of the film's release. The producers of Ra.One spent \u20b9100 million (US$1.5\u00a0million) out of a \u20b9520 million (US$8.0\u00a0million) marketing budget, \u20b9150 million (US$2.3\u00a0million) of this was utilised for internet promotions alone. The film's first theatrical poster was released in December 2010, and was followed by the release of two teaser trailers during the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. The first theatrical trailer premiered three months later. Khan and Sinha undertook a multi-city tour during which they unveiled a 3,600 feet-long piece of fan mail to collect audience messages. The official website of Ra.One was launched on 31 May 2011, and an official YouTube channel for the film was subsequently unveiled. On 20 October 2011, Khan held a live chat with fans on Google Plus, the first time an Indian film personality had done so. Rampal's look in the film, which had been kept secret, was revealed in late October 2011. The film's marketing utilised merchandise and games to facilitate the creation of a franchise. Khan marketed merchandise related to the film, which included toys, tablets and apparel. On 14 October 2011, a gaming tournament featuring games like Call of Duty was conducted in Mumbai and telecast live on YouTube. Red Chillies Entertainment partnered with Sony Computer Entertainment Europe to create \"Ra.One \u2013 The Game,\" a game for PlayStations which was released on 5 October 2011. The producers further collaborated with UTV Indiagames to design a social game titled Ra.One Genesis, with an independent plot based on G.One, in addition to designing digital comics based on the film's characters. In May 2011, the first rushes of Ra.One were shown to the cast of Khan's other home production Always Kabhi Kabhi (2011). Subsequently, the film was screened for test audiences to study and gauge the film's appeal across different age groups. A few days prior to the theatrical release, Khan arranged a special screening of the film's final cut in Yash Raj Studios, where he invited close friends, his family and the film's crew. Between 24 and 26 October 2011, Ra.One had international premieres in Dubai, London and Toronto, all of which were chosen due to their international significance and large South Asian populations. The premiere in Dubai was held on 24 October 2011 at the Grand Cinemas, Wafi. A high-profile dinner and charity auction followed, where Khan raised AED30,000 (approximately US$8,200) to build a workshop for children with special needs. The premiere included three simultaneous screenings of the film, for which tickets were placed on sale for the public. The premiere in London took place at the O2 Cineworld the following day, and the premiere in Toronto took place at the TIFF Bell Lightbox on 26 October 2011. Ra.One was submitted to the Central Board of Film Certification on 14 October 2011 to receive its viewership rating. The Board raised strong objections to the film's action scenes, fearing that they would influence young children to emulate the stunts. The police and the Indian Railways security force had made similar objections to the train-based stunts in the film, claiming that youngsters would \"blindly imitate them\" and hence put their lives at risk. The film was finally passed with a 'U' certificate without cuts, but under the condition that prominent disclaimers were shown, stating that the stunts were computer-generated and should not be imitated. The British Board of Film Classification rated the film 12A for \"moderate fantasy violence\". In March 2012, a Mid-Day report alleged that Ra.One had received a favourable rating, pointing out that the producers had violated the rules by meeting the Board officials during the screening. The film faced allegations of plagiarism with similarities to Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), the Batman series, Iron Man (2008), The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010) and Tron: Legacy (2010). Khan denied the allegations, saying, \"I got inspired from a lot of superhero movies but the movie is original. In fact, Ra.One will be the first superhero-based movie in the world in which the superhero lives in a family.\" A few days before the release, screenwriter Yash Patnaik claimed that Ra.One resembled a concept that he had developed several years before. Patnaik appealed to the Bombay High Court to delay the film's release, until he was given due credit or 10% of the film's overall profit. The court, observing prima facie evidence that there had been copyright violations, asked the filmmakers to deposit \u20b910 million (US$150,000) with the court on 21 October 2011 before releasing the film. However, Patnaik challenged the court's decision and demanded that the producers give him credit and not cash. Sinha later claimed that he alone had developed the film's story. Ra.One also faced cybertheft and hacking issues. On 3 June 2011, three days after its launch, the official website of the film was hacked by suspected Pakistani cyber criminals who stated that the act was in revenge for a similar attack on a Karachi press club website. The hackers defaced the homepage and left a note threatening the Indian Press Club. Despite precautions, the song \"Chammak Challo\" was leaked several months before the official release of the soundtrack. Khan clarified that the leaked song was a \"rough version\" of the actual song, and that the person responsible for the leak was being looked for. He subsequently refuted claims that the leak had been engineered as a publicity stunt. The television broadcasting rights for Ra.One were bought by Star India for a then-record sum of \u20b9350 million (US$5.4\u00a0million), surpassing 3 Idiots (2009). The Indian television premiere of Ra.One took place on 21 January 2012 on STAR Gold, garnering a 28% market sharefor the channel and a TVR of 6.7. Star India subsequently syndicated the television screening rights to Disney XD, where it premiered on 2 June 2012. In May 2012, International Media Distribution announced that Ra.One would be televised on Comcast and Cox, as a part of the celebrations of the Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. Discovery Channel tied up with Red Chillies Entertainment to produce a one-hour program titled \"Revealed: The Making of Ra.One,\" which aired on the channel on 30 March 2012. The program discussed the making of the film in detail, including the visual effects and the challenges faced while filming. Eros International released the DVD of Ra.One on 13 December 2011 across all regions in one-disc and two-disc packs complying with the NTSC format. The DVD of the film contained alternate endings. Initially, Khan had wanted to add alternate endings to the theatrical release itself, but later deemed it risky. The DVD version was made interactive as well. VCD and Blu-Ray versions of the film were also released. Upon release, Ra.One received mixed reviews from critics in India and generally positive reviews overseas. Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 69% of 16 critics gave Ra.One a positive review, with an average critic rating of 5.6/10, granting the film a \"Fresh\" consensus. On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean from film reviews, Ra.One holds a rating of 60% based on eight reviews, signifying \"mixed or average reviews.\" \"Some of the scenes are surely entertaining but when one goes to watch a SRK film, one hopes to be entertained throughout, and sadly Ra.One fails to do so.\" Positive reviews described the film as an ambitious initiative and a technological success, with some critics thinking that Ra.One had put Indian films on par with Hollywood. The visual effects received near-universal praise, though dissenting opinions stated that they were \"all over the place\". The action sequences were also widely praised. Other aspects of the film received more polarising opinions, and one very positive review was criticised for \"over-rating\" the film. Mixed views were opined regarding the plot's gaming concept, with some critics deeming it \"far-fetched\" and others lauding the \"gaming-style aesthetics\". Similarly, some critics called the emotional scenes \"fulfilling\" while others felt them to be \"lacking in connect with the audience\". The story was negatively received by several critics, with a number of them deeming it to be disappointing and lacking in originality; one critic praised the original idea but criticised its \"Bollywoodization\". The direction was criticised in a number of reviews, though a few critics praised Sinha's pacing of the film and the execution of the action sequences. Some critics pointed to the presence of scenes which were not child-friendly, despite Ra.One being promoted as a children's film. Particular reviews criticised the lack of character development and the film's \"incoherently hackneyed morality\". A few critics panned the film as a whole, describing it as a \"mess\"; one review commented, \"It's convenient to say that if you have no expectations from the film, you wouldn't be disappointed.\" After its release, Ra.One received numerous nominations and awards in India and abroad, a majority of them for its technical aspects. The film notably won the National Film Award and the Filmfare Award for Best Special Effects, and four International Indian Film Academy Awards. The film also received several business awards for its marketing and distribution. On the other hand, the film received negative (\"dishonorable\") awards as well. Ra.One won the titles of Worst Film and Worst Director at the Golden Kela Awards, and also won the Worst Film award at the Ghanta Awards. The budget of Ra.One was the subject of significant speculation prior to its release. A number of estimates placed the budget between \u20b91.4 billion (US$22\u00a0million) and \u20b92 billion (US$31\u00a0million). It was universally accepted that the film was the most expensive Bollywood film of all time, with certain sources stating that the film was the most expensive Indian film ever. The original budget was revealed to be \u20b91.30 billion (US$20\u00a0million) after promotional expenses. Khan stated that he had \"worked very hard\" to finance the film without borrowing money, and reportedly hosted a television show just to finance the film. Ra.One earned \u20b91.32 billion (US$20\u00a0million) from pre-release revenue sources, setting a new record for Bollywood films. The extensive marketing campaign greatly increased audience expectations of the film. Ra.One set records for the level of pre-release buzz for a Bollywood film, and also topped a number of polls gauging the most awaited Bollywood films of the year. Anticipation for the film was equally high among the trade analysts, with some commenting that the film would pass the \u20b91 billion (US$15\u00a0million) mark in one week and the \u20b93 billion (US$46\u00a0million) mark in over three weeks. Advance bookings commenced on 20 October 2011 on a limited scale, and expanded later. While initial ticket sales were low, they picked up considerably near the release date. A few days prior to the release, the advance booking was described as \"phenomenal,\" with an overall advance booking rate of 20\u201325% across the country. A number of advantages of the film's release were pointed out, such as the festive season and higher 3D ticket prices, though there had been doubt regarding the timely release of the 3D version. In India, Ra.One debuted at the beginning of the five-day Diwali weekend, and subsequently broke the Diwali opening day record. The film then set the records for the biggest single-day net revenue and the biggest three-day opening weekend earned by a Bollywood film, breaking the previous records held by Bodyguard. Subsequently, the film began to suffer significant drops in its collections, with its five-day extended weekend and nine-day extended week coming second to the records of Bodyguard. The film faced an 84 percent drop in collections in its second week and fell a further 90 percent in its third week, the latter primarily due to the release of Rockstar. The dubbed versions showed similar trends. The Tamil and Telugu versions together earned around \u20b950 million (US$770,000) nett. In overseas markets, Ra.One earned the highest three-day and five-day opening weekends among the Bollywood releases of 2011; by its second weekend, the film had become the highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2011 in overseas markets, but the collections suffered drops throughout. In general, families and children formed the major portion of the film's audience, and the 3D version is regarded as a success. \"A film like this requires a year-and-a-half of pre-production, so it's impossible for me to give you a time frame. I'm unsure if it'll even get made or if I'll use the technology in some other genre [...] I know it is going to be expensive, but perhaps the next film would be cheaper since I now have the technology.\" Reports of a planned sequel of Ra.One began surfacing prior to the film's release, though the extent of real progress on the sequel is unknown. Both Khan and Sinha admitted to formulating plans for a sequel, though the former noted that it would be \"presumptuous\" to start the sequel before the first film's release. Khan later refuted the speculations, saying that a sequel was unlikely due to his other commitments. After Ra.One won a National Award, an \"overjoyed\" Khan said that the film's world could be further explored. He stated that the sequel, if made, would be titled G.One and not Ra.Two, and that he would make it \"faster, bigger and better\" than Ra.One. Khan was reported to be looking for a script, without a fixed release date. In April 2012, Mushtaq Sheikh said that the pre-production of the sequel had begun. A number of reports stated that Kareena Kapoor would not be a part of the sequel. Despite Khan's enthusiasm for the idea of a sequel, the film industry expressed mixed opinions regarding it. Filmmaker Rajkumar Gupta commented, \"It would be challenging to take forward a story that has not worked earlier.\" Producer Ramesh Taurani responded negatively to the idea, saying, \"It is important for the film to be appreciated so that a sequel can be made.\" Trade analyst Atul Mohan called the sequel \"a bad idea.\" Conversely, others were supportive of the sequel. Producer Goldie Behl brushed aside arguments about the success of the first film, saying, \"If the people think that they can earn some more, then it doesn't matter how big or small the hit was.\" Director Kunal Kohli also reacted positively, saying, \"Certain ideas naturally lend themselves to sequels. So why not use that investment of your time and effort to make a sequel that will take the brand further?\"",

        "full_text": " Refugee is a 2000 Indian film written and directed by J. P. Dutta. It marked the debuts of Abhishek Bachchan, son of popular actor Amitabh Bachchan, and Kareena Kapoor, the younger sister of actress Karisma Kapoor. The film also starred Jackie Shroff, Sunil Shetty and Anupam Kher. Refugee performed moderately well at the box office and was the fifth highest grossing film of that year. It is the story of an unnamed Indian Muslim, who helps illegal refugees from India and Pakistan cross the border through the Great Rann of Kutch. The film is attributed to have been inspired by the short story \"Love Across the Salt Desert\" by Keki N. Daruwalla.   Bihar-based Manzur Ahmad and his family was migrated to East Pakistan after the partitioning of India in 1947. However, after the formation of the state of Bangladesh in 1971, he and several other people were forced to relocate to the western part of Pakistan. To do this by land, they will have to cross India. The route from Dhaka leads to Guwahati in India then to Delhi then to Ajmer then to Bhuj, and then on to Haji Peer in Pakistan. They get as far as Bhuj, but afterward they are assisted by an agent known only as \"Refugee\", who helps them trek their way across the Great Rann of Kutch to Pakistan. Refugee considers his clients as mere items of luggage and refuses to be emotionally involved with them and their stories. Then he meets Nazneen Ahmed, the daughter of Manzur Ahmed: He forgets this rule and falls in love with her. Police on both sides of the border are aware of the illegal refugee traffic and the Indian police regularly questions Refugee and his old father Jan Muhammad. One day, Refugee helps four men enter the Indian side of the border. These men enlist the help of Mr. Muhammad's other son to get to Delhi. Shortly thereafter, explosions take place in trains, buses, and buildings in the Indian capital. Refugee crosses the border once again to visit Nazneen. She asks him to take her with him since her father wants to marry her to Mohammad Ashraf, a Pakistani border security officer. While crossing the border through Rann they are captured by Pakistanis rangers. Refugee is beaten up and sent to India on a camel. The Indian BSF captures him and treats him in hospital. The Indians informs him that he unknowingly helped terrorists cross into India and caused several deaths. Refugee joins the BSF and fights the terrorists who laid siege to his village. The film ends with Nazneen giving birth to Refugee's child at the border between the two nations. Indian BSF and Pakistani Rangers personnel discuss the child's nationality in a lighter vein. Refugee's music received two National Film Awards: one for Best Music Direction and the other for Best Lyrics (for the song \"Panchi Nadiya\"). Taran Adarsh gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and praised the songs by saying \"The music touches the heart of every listener. Every moment you feel like a heavenly moment.\" The awards it won are highlighted in bold. The crew having traveled from Mumbai was based at the city of Bhuj and majority of the shooting took place around in the Kutch District of the Indian state of Gujarat including the Great Rann of Kutch (also on BSF controlled \"snow white\" Rann within), villages and Border Security Force (BSF) posts in Banni grasslands and the Rann, Tera fort village, Lakhpat fort village, Khera fort village, a village in southern Kutch, some ancient temples of Kutch, and with parts and a song filmed on set in Mumbai's Kamalistan Studios. Bipasha Basu was convinced by another judge, Jaya Bachchan, to play the role of a village belle opposite her son Abhishek Bachchan in J. P. Dutta\u2019s Aakhari Mughal. The film was cancelled, and Dutta changed the script and made Refugee with Kareena Kapoor. Basu was offered a role in Refugee opposite Sunil Shetty, which she declined. Tabu was signed to play a Doctor but her role eventually got scrapped.J.P. Dutta initially wanted Akshaye Khanna to play Shadab Khan's role but decided aganist it as the role was very small. Refugee is attributed to have been inspired by the story based around the Great Rann of Kutch by Keki N. Daruwalla titled Love across the salt desert. It is included as a short story in the School Standard 11 and 12 syllabus English textbook of NCERT in India.",

        "full_text": " Eros International Rockstar is a 2011 Indian musical romantic drama film directed by Imtiaz Ali, starring Ranbir Kapoor and Nargis Fakhri, with music composed by A. R. Rahman. The film also stars Moufid Aziz, Aditi Rao Hydari, Piyush Mishra, Shernaz Patel, Kumud Mishra in supporting roles, and also Shammi Kapoor, who makes his last silver screen appearance. The film was produced by Eros International Ltd. along with Shree Ashtavinayak Cine Vision Ltd. It follows Janardhan Jakhar a.k.a. JJ or Jordan, who dreams of becoming a rockstar like his inspiration, Jim Morrison. Yet, eventually on attaining all that he dreamt of, Jordan ends up anguished and despondent without Heer Kaul, whom he so fiercely, passionately loved. Development of Rockstar commenced in May 2010. Nargis Fakhri was cast as the female lead, after plans to give the role to Kareena Kapoor were shelved. Filming in India took place at Delhi, Kashmir, Mumbai and Dharamsala, while the foreign sequences were shot in Prague and Liberec, Czech Republic. Rockstar was released on 11 November 2011. On the day of release, Tibetans in Chennai and Dharmasala protested against the Central Board of Film Certification for asking the film-makers to censor scenes featuring the Tibetan flag. Upon release, the film received positive to mixed reviews. Critics highlighted Kapoor and Rahman as the stars of the film, but panned the plot. The film did well at the box office, managing to appeal the youngsters in the cities. Made on a budget of \u20b9600 million (US$9.3\u00a0million), Rockstar grossed \u20b91.08 billion (US$17\u00a0million) worldwide. Kapoor and Rahman received numerous awards for their work in the film. Since its release, Rockstar has gained a cult following across indian urban youths.   A large crowd gathers outside the Verona Arena in Italy, with eager fans queuing to watch the performance of Jordan (Ranbir Kapoor), a rock musician. Despite being mobbed, Jordan manages to escape and reach the arena. He shows a complete disregard for his fans, storms onto the stage in a fit of rage and starts strumming angrily on his guitar. A flashback reveals the story of Jordan, whose real name is Janardhan Jhakar a.k.a. JJ, a simple Jat boy from, Delhi. He is a student at Hindu College who dreams of becoming an international star, and this dream is often laughed at by his friends and class mates. Khatana(Kumud Mishra), the canteen owner, tells JJ that the only way a meaningful melody can be produced is by undergoing trauma via a heartbreak. JJ jokingly tells himself that since he hasn't yet seen bad times, he won't be able to reach his idol's (Jim Morrison) level of fame. He goes to the performance of Heer Kaul (Nargis Fakhri), a beautiful Kashmiri Pandit girl from St. Stephens College, and overhears that she is the \"perfect heartbreaking machine\". Instantly deciding to propose to her, he suffers humiliation, which he deciphers as the perfect method for receiving the heart-break needed to achieve stardom. However, over time they become good friends, often going on fun adventures together and sometimes engaging in behavior which the conservative JJ thinks is risky. Heer becomes engaged to Jai (Moufid Aziz) and ultimately marries him in Kashmir, after which the couple depart to Prague. During this time, she develops feelings for JJ and coins the nickname \"Jordan\" for him before leaving. JJ returns home finds himself thrown out by his elder brother for attending Heer\u2019s wedding and allegedly stealing \u20b95,00,000 - something which he did not do. He takes refuge for two months in the nearby Nizamuddin Dargah, singing qawwalis, and then moves into Khatana's home. Ustad Jameel Khan (Shammi Kapoor), a Padma Bhushan classical artist, remembers JJ singing at the Dargah, and prompts Dhingra (Piyush Mishra), the owner of \"Platinum Records\", to sign JJ as a future star. Sheena (Aditi Rao Hydari), a journalist, interviews JJ and hints to him that Dhingra intends to send some artists to Prague for a tour and recordings. JJ instantly volunteers to work there, in the hopes of reuniting with Heer. During this time, JJ is slowly gaining fame and transforming his public persona into 'Jordan'. Heer, meanwhile, suffers from continuous spurts of health problems. She meets JJ in Prague and they reconnect, but when he tries to profess his love for her, Heer, being married, spurns his advances. JJ tries to visit Heer one last time before she departs to India, but in doing so, he is arrested for trespassing on her property. While this goes on, Heer suddenly collapses. Upon being deported back to India, JJ is overwhelmed by the attention he receives, and he clashes with the media and the Indian Police out of frustration, resulting in a term in jail. Dhingra becomes happy about the publicity he has received because of JJ, as it has helped record sales. After being released, JJ terminates his contract with Dhingra's company, embarks on a country-wide tour for his concerts and finally morphs fully into 'Jordan' - the true Rockstar which he had always wanted to be. He turns into a bitter, arrogant and lonely man, finding that the fame does not fill the void in his life. Khatana is now his manager, but fails to control him, and Jordan is constantly involved in fights with the media and fans. In spite of all this, he remains a highly popular artist. Jordan meets Heer's younger sister Mandy (Sanjana Sanghi) during one of his performances, and she asks him to help Heer - who has been diagnosed with Aplastic Anemia. Although he is initially asked to leave by Heer's mother Neena (Shernaz Patel), Jordan's presence causes Heer to recover somewhat. He starts disregarding his musical obligations as he spends more time with Heer, and soon Khatana asks Heer to persuade Jordan to attend his concerts. Heer accompanies him to a show, and the media links them as a couple, portraying her as having an affair despite being married. Heer asks Jordan to complete his tour and allow them both them time to rest, before reuniting with her once again. During this time, her condition worsens; she slowly slips into a coma, and is discovered to be pregnant with Jordan's child. Mandy calls him for one last time hoping that he can help Heer recover. However, her condition only worsens and she falls into a coma, by which time Jordan realizes that she will not survive. Heer dies, and Jordan goes through intense emotion of anger, depression and heartbreak. This fuels his music and he becomes an international superstar, reaching the heights of his idol Jim Morrison. Back in the Verona Arena, Jordan starts the concert in an angry, apathetic manner. While performing, Jordan sees a vision of Heer walking towards him, smiling lovingly. The audience cheers on, despite his tears and oblivious to his anguish. A montage of all the happy times the couple spent together plays, ending with a line from Mawlana Jalal-ud-Din Rumi's poem: \"Away, beyond all concepts of wrong-doing and right-doing, there is a field. I'll meet you there\". The male lead of Rockstar is played by Ranbir Kapoor, with whom Eros International worked previously on Anjaana Anjaani. His role of Jordan is loosely based on Imtiaz Ali's Jat friend, who lived in a small settlement in Pitam Pura. He had seen Kareena Kapoor's performance in his Jab We Met and wanted to cast her in the film. However, the script required some romantic scenes between the leads. As Ranbir and Kareena happened to be cousins, this was touted as a problem. Moreover, the filmmakers did not want to replace Ranbir with any other actor as the character he portrayed was reportedly suitable only for him. They then made a joint decision to replace Kapoor with Nargis Fakhri, after initially approaching Sonam Kapoor and Diana Penty for the replacement. Voice actor Mona Ghosh Shetty dubbed for Fakhri. The film marked Shammi Kapoor's last appearance in a feature film; he died on 14 August 2011. The shooting for Rockstar began in May 2010. A major part of the shooting took place in Kashmir at Kulgam, Kupwara and Srinagar, while the last phase was shot in Delhi at places like the Kotla Mubarakpur, Nizamuddin Dargah, Greater Kailash, Munirka, Indira Gandhi International Airport, Amity School (deleted scenes), Connaught Place, Shri Ram College of Commerce, BL Kapoor Hospital, Rajendra Nagar, St. Stephen's College and the Hindu College, which was Imtiaz Ali's alma mater. Foreign sequences were shot at Wenceslas Square, Charles Bridge and the Old Town in parts of Prague and at Dr. Bene\u0161 Square in Liberec. The film was shot in reverse as the crew didn't want to break the continuity of Ranbir's hairstyle. The climax with long hair was shot first. Kapoor had to transform himself into a rockstar: he practised guitar at A. R. Rahman's studio in Chennai for many days, read Kurt Cobain's biography and familiarised himself with Jats. Rockstar's costumes were designed by Aki Narula and Manish Malhotra, who dressed Ranbir in \"small-town denim-and-sweater combination and later, Pathani-style kurtas with arm bands\", thus completing the rockstar look. Nargis Fakhri, who plays the role of a Kashmiri Pandit girl, wore a traditional Kashmiri Pandit wedding outfit in the wedding scene, which included Pandit Pheran, Dejhor (ear ornament) and Taranga (head cap worn underneath the veil). This also happens to be the first time in Bollywood that a Kashmiri Pandit wedding was shown. The music for the film is scored by A. R. Rahman, who replaces Imtiaz Ali's regular song composer, Pritam. This also marks the first Imtiaz Ali film since his debut Socha Na Tha, to have the same composer for both film score and songs. The soundtrack features 14 tracks, with all lyrics penned by Irshad Kamil. The recording of the album took place in Chennai, London and Mumbai. Mohit Chauhan had lent his voice for nine songs. The audio rights were bought by T-Series. Upon release on 30 September 2011, it received positive reviews from critics. \"Sadda Haq\" became the most popular song of the album and was named as a \"youth anthem\". Rockstar released on 11 November 2011 and saw a good advance opening at multiplexes closer to educational institutions. The film released in 2,500 screens, and saw cinema halls running 14 to 15 shows in a day. Major parts of the song \"Sadda Haq\" were shot at the Norbulingka monastery in McLeod Ganj, Dharamsala and people waving the free Tibet flag in the backdrop were shown in the song video. This triggered a dispute between Central Board of Film Certification and Imtiaz Ali when the Board asked Ali to blur the flag before the film hit the theatre, but the director refused to do it. Imtiaz Ali said, \"I am not concerned at all. I have been out of India for long and don\u2019t know whats going on, but I don\u2019t see anything controversial in the intention portrayal in the movie. The purpose of the movie is not to make any social message, its more about personal freedom rather than a geographical issue.\" However, he had to remove the sequence from the video to get the film's censor done. Later an official from the Board stated: \"The Censor Board chief explained to them that all the cuts were made by the director voluntarily,and he had the option of appealing to a review board which he didn\u2019t do. There were certain discussions between (Imtiaz) Ali and the Board regarding retaining a kiss between two actors (Ranbir and Nargis), but there have been no disagreement regarding deleting the flag from the frames.\" The controversy sparked protests among the Tibetan diaspora in Dharamsala and Chennai. Later television broadcasts blotted out a \"Free Tibet\" banner featured in the song. Raja Sen of Rediff gave the film 4 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Rockstar is a simple, unspectacular tale, sometimes even predictable, but director Imtiaz Ali masterfully weaves in details that draw us in.\" Aniruddha Guha of DNA too gave the film 4 out of 5 saying that the film was \"like an effective crescendo that leaves you wanting more.\" Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India also gave the film 4 out of 5 and stated that \"The highpoint of Rockstar is it's high tension, high-on-passion romance between two unlikely people\". Sukanya Verma of Rediff rated it 3.5 stars out of 5 and said, \"Rockstar is flawed but fabulous.\" Mayank Shekhar of Hindustan Times also gave a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and noted \"The canvas is wide like early Sanjay Leela Bhansali's; bird's view of the stunning bridge is very Mani Ratnam; witty, earthy dialogues are so Vishal Bhardwaj. Director Imitiaz Ali manages to retain a personal, auteur's touch in a genre vastly commercial, mainstream. This is a rare feat.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and said \"On the whole, Rockstar does not live up to the confidence and expectations from the otherwise very skilled and accomplished film-maker Imtiaz Ali.\" Hrithik Sharma of El Viaje Reviews included it into his select list of Bollywood classics and says that \"Rockstar is a unique cocktail of 50% drama, 40% romance and 10% comedy. What stands out is the music by A. R. Rahman. Each song in the film is a masterpiece and fits very well into the plot. Cinematography is realistic but prepossessing indeed. The film gets a 10 on 10 in this department. There are certain scenes in the film that may seem unrelated to the plot but those would be the scenes that would stay with you longer.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN also gave 3 stars out of 5, commenting \"Imtiaz Ali's Rockstar is a far-from-perfect film, but it has honesty and depth, which is mostly missing in Hindi movies today.\" Sumit Bhattacharya of Rediff gave a rating of 2.5 out of 5, saying that \"Rockstar is what is called a one-time watch\", and highlighted that the film \"is more Devdas than Jim Morrison\". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV too gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, and said \"Rockstar has a Sufi soul. If only it had been set free and allowed to go the whole hog!\" Komal Nahta of Koimoi again gave the film 2.5 out of 5, and said, \"Rockstar will meet with a mixed response: one section of the audience (mainly youngsters in the cities) will love it while another section (mainly the single-screen audience and public of smaller cities) will find it ordinary.\" Kaveree Bamzai of India Today gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and said \"AR Rahman's music is the soul of the film. What is missing is the spine, leaving just a jelly in place.\" Yahoo! gave the film 1 star out of 5, and said \"Rockstar drives home an unscientific hypothesis that people who\u2019ve endured sufferings/heart break etc will reach their creative best.\" A reviewer from Reuters commented that Rahman and Ranbir are the stars of the film while saying \"Rockstar works on so many levels, but it fails miserably on so many more.\". Upon release, Rockstar had a very good opening. The film opened to a good response at multiplexes with bookings averaging around 60\u201370%, and single screens witnessed a lower capacity at around 30\u201340%. It collected \u20b9100 million (US$1.5\u00a0million) nett on its opening day, thus becoming the second highest opener in a non-festival season after Ready. The good opening was attributed to the multiplexes across cities, the \"star power\" of Ranbir Kapoor as well as the youthful theme of the film. The film showed growth on Saturday by grossing \u20b9112.5 million (US$1.7\u00a0million) nett, therefore taking its two-day net total to \u20b9205 million (US$3.2\u00a0million). A similar growth was seen on Sunday, and hence the first weekend collection ended at \u20b9337.5 million (US$5.2\u00a0million) nett, the majority of which was collected from Mumbai, Pune, Delhi & Bangalore. Rockstar opened well on Monday collecting around \u20b957.5 million (US$890,000) nett, with 40% drop as compared to the first day collections, thus taking the four-day total to \u20b9390 million (US$6.0\u00a0million) nett. The film collection saw another noticeable fall on Tuesday as it collected around \u20b942.5 million (US$660,000) nett, with five days collection totalling to \u20b9432.5 million (US$6.7\u00a0million) nett. At the end of first week, the film had a good collection by grossing \u20b9474.6 million (US$7.3\u00a0million) nett, though the film had found appreciation only with a small section of the audience. In the process, it was ranked ninth in the list of all-time first week domestic collections. Rockstar grossed \u20b925.0 million (US$390,000) nett on second Friday, with a 75% drop as compared to the first day. On Saturday, the film collected \u20b932.5 million (US$500,000) nett, and \u20b942.5 million (US$660,000) nett on Sunday, taking the second weekend collection totalled at \u20b9100 million (US$1.5\u00a0million), representing a 70% drop from its first weekend. As of ten days, the film had collected approximately \u20b9574.6 million (US$8.9\u00a0million) nett. Rockstar made \u20b9158.5 million (US$2.5\u00a0million) nett in the second week, declining by 67% and taking the two-week collection totalled at \u20b9633.1 million (US$9.8\u00a0million) nett. The film on week three managed to earn \u20b929.6 million (US$460,000), and hence taking three weeks collections to \u20b9662.7 million (US$10\u00a0million). By the end of its fifth week, the film netted \u20b9674.9 million (US$10\u00a0million). Rockstar managed to gross $1.65 million from all overseas markets and was termed as below the mark.

Laxmikant Pyarelal were the music directors. It was released on 18 October 1974 with films like Roti and Benaam. The title is based on the Urdu phrase referring to the bare necessities of life, which was popularized in the late 1960s by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto ahead of the Pakistani general election, 1970. It was the highest grossing Indian film of 1974 and one of the biggest blockbusters of Manoj Kumar. The Telugu movie Jeevana Poratam, starring Sobhan Babu, Rajinikanth, Kaikala Satyanarayana, Naresh, Vijayashanti, is a remake.   After the retirement of his dad (Krishan Dhawan), the responsibility is on Bharat (Manoj Kumar) to look after his Delhi-based family. He has two younger college-going brothers, Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) and Deepak (Dheeraj Kumar) and a sister of marriagable age, Champa (Meena T.). Although Bharat is a college graduate, the only work he can find is as a low-paid singer, much to the frustration of his girlfriend, Sheetal (Zeenat Aman). Meanwhile, Vijay has turned to crime as a last resort to provide for the family, but after an argument with Bharat, he leaves home to join the army. Sheetal starts working as a secretary for rich businessman Mohan Babu (Shashi Kapoor) and Mohan becomes attracted to her. She becomes attracted to Mohan but is more interested in his wealth and luxury. She loves Bharat but cannot contemplate a life in poverty. Bharat finally finds a job as a builder but starts to realise that Sheetal is slowly drifting away from him. Soon he loses his job after the government takes over the building site and his financial problems increase further. When Mohan proposes marriage to Sheetal, she accepts, leaving Bharat heartbroken. After losing his love, Bharat also loses his father, which devastates him. Frustrated, he burns his diploma on his father's funeral pyre. Meanwhile, Champa has found a suitor, but Bharat has no money to pay for the wedding and it cannot go ahead. Depressed at the state of his life, Bharat soon finds salvation by helping a poor girl, Tulsi (Moushumi Chatterjee), who lives in poverty but gets by. He also makes friends with Sardar Harnam Singh (Prem Nath) who comes to his rescue when he attempts to save Tulsi from a gang of hoodlums. He then receives an offer from a corrupt businessman named Nekiram (Madan Puri) who persuades Bharat to do his illegal activities so he and his family will come out of poverty and be wealthy. The plot centers on whether Bharat agree to this or whether his moral nature stops him from turning to crime to provide for his family.",

        "full_text": " Rudaali is a 1993 Hindi film directed by Indian director Kalpana Lajmi, based on the short story written by famous Bengali litterateur Mahasweta Devi. The film was selected as the Indian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 66th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. The film is set in a small village in Rajasthan, India. It tells the story of a woman named Shanichari, who was abandoned by her mother shortly after her father's death. Bad fortune follows her throughout her life.   The title is a reference to a custom in certain areas of Rajasthan where women of a lower caste are hired as professional mourners upon the death of upper-caste males. These women are referred to as a \"rudaali\" (roo-dah-lee), literally translated as \"female weeper\" or \"weeping woman\". Their job is to publicly express grief of family members who are not permitted to display emotion due to social status. As the narrative begins, the dying zamindar/ Thakur (translation: landlord) (Amjad Khan) of the desert village of Barna has been shifted from his mansion to an outbuilding and is performing the rite of godaan\u00a0or gifting a cow to a brahman. Anticipating his imminent death, and realizing that none of his close relatives are likely to mourn him, he summons a rudaali named Bhikni (Rakhee) from a nearby town. While waiting for her client to die, Bhikni temporarily lodges in the modest home of Shanichari (Dimple Kapadia), a widow whose life has been plagued by misfortune. Born on a Saturday (a bad-luck day ruled by the malefic planet Shanichar or Saturn), the ill-omened girl child was blamed by villagers for the untimely death of her father, and then for her own abandonment by her mother, Peewli, who ran off to join a\u00a0nautanki\u00a0folk theatre troupe. The tale of Shanichari\u2019s life, told to the sympathetic Bhikni, unfolds in a series of flashbacks.  Shanichari\u2019s early marriage to a drunkard named Ganju ends abruptly when her husband succumbs to an outbreak of plague at a village fair. She is left with a son, Budhua (played as an adult by Raghuveer Yadav), whom she adores, though she realizes that he has inherited her mother\u2019s penchant for irresponsible wandering. Her poverty is relieved somewhat by employment at the zamindar\u2019s haveli (mansion) after the master\u2019s son, Lakshman Singh (Raj Babbar) takes a fancy to her. She attends on his spoiled but strictly secluded wife, and periodically converses with her benefactor, who lectures her on social equality and urges her to \u201clook up\u201d into his eyes when speaking to him. This romance leads to the master\u2019s gift to Shanichari, one night after a singing performance, of her own house and two acres of land\u2014a gesture that offers her a modicum of financial security within the village. One day, Budhua brings home a pregnant young prostitute,\u00a0Mungri (Sushmita Mukherjee) as his wife. Their marriage is brief, as the quarrelsome Mungri aborts their child, Shanichari\u2019s hoped-for grandson. Budhua then runs away from home. Shanichari\u2019s painful reminiscences of these trials\u2014throughout which, she says, she has never been able to shed a tear\u2014alternate with scenes in the present, depicting her growing bond with Bhikni. On the very night of the old zamindar\u2019s long-awaited death, Bhikni is called over to meet Bhimdata from the neighbouring village. As Shanichari bids adieu to Lakshman Singh, who plans to leave the village after his father's death, a messenger comes from Bhimdata. The messenger tells her of Bhikni's untimely death due to the plague, and of how in her dying breath she had asked Shanichari to be informed of how she was actually Peewli, her mother. This unleashes Shanichari\u2019s pent-up emotions and transforms her, too, into a rudaali. Dimple Kapadia won a National Film Award for her role of Shanichari in the film. Khan died before the film's release, and the film is dedicated to him in the beginning credits. Samir Chanda won National Film Award for Best Art Direction. Simple Kapadia won the National Film Award for Best Costume Design. The film has music by folk musician Bhupen Hazarika. All lyrics written by Gulzar; all music composed by Bhupen Hazarika. ",

        "full_text": " Saaransh (English: The Gist  ) is a 1984 Hindi drama film directed by Mahesh Bhatt and starring Anupam Kher, Rohini Hattangadi, Madan Jain, Nilu Phule, Suhas Bhalekar and Soni Razdan. It is about an elderly Maharashtrian couple living in Mumbai who come to terms with the loss of their only son. This was the screen debut of Anupam Kher. The film had music by Ajit Verman and lyrics by Vasant Dev. It was distributed by Rajshri Productions. It was chosen as India's official entry for the 1985 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, where it wasn't nominated.   The movie begins with B.V. Pradhan (Anupam Kher) waking up early in the morning to write a letter to his son, Ajay, who lives in New York. Midway through the letter, Pradhan remembers the tragic reality: Pradhan received a call from a friend of his son, Ajay, that Ajay has been killed in a mugging in New York. Pradhan's best friend, Vishwanath, and Pradhan's wife, Parvati (Rohini Hattangadi) are both worried that even though it's been 3 months, Pradhan has yet to fully come to terms with the loss of his only son. Pradhan confesses to Vishwanath that after the loss of his son, he no longer has any will left to live. He tries to commit suicide by diving under a speeding car, albeit unsuccessfully. Due to the death of their son, Pradhan has no source of income, so they rent out a room of their Shivaji Park (Mumbai) apartment to a budding Bollywood actress, Sujata Suman (Soni Razdan). Sujata is romantically involved with Vilas (Madan Jain), the only son of an influential politician Gajanan Chitre (Nilu Phule). Vilas wishes to marry Sujata, but he does not tell his father about Sujata out of cowardice and keeps on postponing their marriage plans. Meanwhile, Pradhan receives a registered letter that his son's ashes and a few other belongings (a TV, VCR, a refrigerator etc.) have arrived from USA to India. When Pradhan goes to the customs office to collect them, he is disrespected and gets no help from the Public Relations Officer. An emotionally disturbed and enraged Pradhan forcibly enters the office of the main head of the customs department and explains that he has come only to pick up his son's ashes and not any other material possessions. Pradhan demands that his son's ashes be handed to him immediately and breaks down to tears, upon which the officer consoles Pradhan and relents to his request. The officer apologises for the inconvenience and assures Pradhan that the remaining items will be transferred to Pradhan as soon as possible. Pradhan, an atheist, gives his son's ashes to Parvati, who takes his ashes to a Pandit (Alok Nath). The Pandit tells Pradhan and Parvati that Ajay will soon be reincarnated, in the form of a baby, near them. Disillusioned, Pradhan takes some of Ajay's ashes and spreads them near a park bench in the nearby kids park. Realising the futility of his painful life, Pradhan tries to commit suicide by ingesting liquid poison. Parvati implores him to change his mind, but Pradhan does not relent. Finally, they both decide to end their lives by consuming poison together. Just as Pradhan and Parvati are about to commit suicide, Sujata informs Vilas that she's pregnant. When Vilas still shows indecisiveness in marrying Sujata, she calls him a coward and throws him out. When Pradhan finds out, he offers to take Sujata to meet Gajanan with the hope that he will permit Sujata and Vilas to get married. When Vilas refuses to accept that Sujata is carrying his baby, Gajanan, despite knowing that Vilas is lying, refuses their proposal and threatens Pradhan and Sujata of dire consequences if Sujata does not abort the child and moves away to another town. However, Pradhan, out of principle, refuses to let a helpless Sujata leave and provides her a safe haven in his house. Parvati, upon hearing that Sujata is with a baby, starts believing that the baby in Sujata's womb is, in fact, going to be the reincarnation of Ajay. She starts caring for Sujata and her beliefs about Ajay being reincarnated get even more firmly entrenched in her mind. Gajanan tries all the tricks of the trade to dissuade Sujata from having the baby: his goons to try to bribe Pradhan, they harass Pradhan by cutting off the electricity of his house and beat up Vishwanath (thereby preventing him from supplying milk to Pradhan's house) and his goons even throw ignited crackers into Pradhan's house. Gajanan himself persuades a local doctor to illegally carry out the abortion of Sujata's baby in his clinic (where Sujata is scheduled for a checkup). When all else fails, Gajanan, through Vilas (who is unaware of his father's intentions) traps Pradhan in a fake scam of aiding and abetting a prostitution ring (involving illegal marked bills). Pradhan tries to call the Commissioner of Police for help, but is prevented due to red-tapism. Exasperated, Pradhan storms into the Mantralaya, the office of the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. The C.M. turns out to be one of Pradhan's former students, Shashikant. The C.M. immediately calls up the Commissioner of Police, the Remand Home where Sujata is being held in custody and demands Gajanan Chitre be produced to ensure that justice is rightfully served. Pradhan realises that Parvati's adamant belief that Ajay will be reincarnated as Sujata's baby will cause problems to them and Sujata and Vilas, so he asks them both to leave the city in the wee hours of the night and go live their lives happily elsewhere. He gifts them Ajay's belongings that have finally been handed over to Pradhan by the customs office. Sujata, however, requests to see Parvati one last time. When Parvati refuses to let Vilas and Sujata leave, Pradhan controls her and makes them leave. Parvati is shocked and heartbroken, but Pradhan helps her realise that Ajay has died and will never come back. When Parvati says that they should both consume poison together, Pradhan refuses, saying that he has realised that the Saaransh of his life is in her beautiful wrinkles, and they have both done a good deed in helping Sujata's baby survive despite the problems she faced. The movie ends with Pradhan taking Parvati for an early morning walk to the nearby kids park. There, they see that beautiful flowers have sprouted where Pradhan once scattered some of Ajay's ashes. Pradhan then tells Parvati that the real beauty of life is that we all are mortal, but life goes on. Made after his critically acclaimed Arth (1982), this film carried forward his venturing into the genre of confessional cinema. It was inspired by the death of a young son of Mahesh Bhatt's spiritual guru, U. G. Krishnamurti of cancer, and later by a Maharashtrian couple whose only son was murdered in New York. Initially Anupam Kher, originally from Shimla and a National School of Drama alumnus, was chosen to play the lead role. Later producers Rajshri Productions insisted in taking an established actor, Sanjeev Kumar for the role. Thus fortnight before the principal photography was to commence, Kher who had been preparing for almost eight months for his debut, got the news. When Bhatt confirmed the change, he packed his bags and left town. However, before leaving, he met Bhatt and expressed his frustration. Subsequently, Bhatt kept him as the lead, and the producers agreed. The film began on 1 January 1984 with very first scene of Pradhan played by Kher, receiving the phone call from New York. Kher was only 28 years old, when he played the role retired stubborn old man. For the pivotal scene, where he had to haggle with customs officials to recover his son's ashes. Kher had no reference of such a situation and tapped into all his hardships as struggling actor in Mumbai to reach the emotional point. The scene was shot at an office space in Film City, Mumbai, and was completed in a single take, without rehearsals or use of glycerine. He went on to win Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance. Saaransh explores how the couple copes with the loneliness and anxieties of old age and the utter aimlessness of life after the death of their only son, a victim of arbitrary violence. While the headmaster's wife seeks refuge in religion and faith, the headmaster remains stoic and becomes obsessive about the memories of his son. In his efforts to reach out to his dead son, he starts writing letters to him every day, only to tear them away. It also focuses on the importance of finding new meaning and purpose in life, no matter the age. Other themes it touches on are through Pradhan's interactions with custom officials and police \u2014 corruption, politics-crime nexus and bureaucratic delay, rampant bribery and red-tapism. The music was given by Ajit Varman and lyrics by Vasant Dev. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's \"Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema\" described Saaransh as Mahesh Bhatt's \"finest film\u00a0\u2013 moving, mellow, and mature\u00a0\u2013 as the viewer feels the pain and despair of an elderly couple...\"  The lead pair, Anupam Kher and Rohini Hattangadi, were praised for their portrayals, described by The Tribune as \"immortal performances\". Coming after the success of Arth (1982), the critical acclaim of Saaransh established Bhatt as a director of repute. Even today, it remains one of the few stand out in \"middle-of-the-road\" films of the 1980s decade Hindi cinema, which is retrospective seen as a decade decline of content in the mainstream cinema. It went on to win three Filmfare Awards: Best Actor for Anupam Kher, Best Story for Mahesh Bhatt, and Best Art Direction for Madhukar Shinde. It was nominated for four other awards, including Best Movie, Best Director (Bhatt), Best Actress (Rohini Hattangadi) and Best Supporting Actress (Soni Razdan). At the 32nd National Film Awards, the film also won one National Film Award for Best Lyrics for Vasant Dev. Saaransh was included in the Panorama section of the 1984 International Film Festival of India (IFFI). It was India's official submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, though it did not make it to the final run. Among other awards, Bhatt received a special prize at the 14th Moscow International Film Festival, and was a nominee for the Golden Prize.",

Suhani also expresses her own love and feelings for him. The film ends as Aditya and Suhani finally make up and hug each other on the hospital bed. There are 9 songs composed by A. R. Rahman and lyrics by Gulzar. A. R. Rahman re-used most of his compositions from the Tamil soundtrack of Alaipayuthey, with the exception of two songs, \"Mere Yaar Mila De\" and \"Naina Milaike\" which replaced their Tamil counterparts \"Evano Oruvan\" and \"Alaipayuthey\". The soundtrack turned out to be one of the strong points of the film. The soundtrack of Saathiya was considered for the Best Music Direction nomination for the 50th National Film Awards, however, since the music was reused from Alaipayuthey the jury dropped it. Saathiya won most of the music awards, though having tough competition. A. R. Rahman and Sonu Nigam received awards for Best Music Director and Best Male Playback for \"Saathiya\", respectively. Saathiya won six awards at the Filmfare Awards.",

R. Chopra. The film stars Vyjayanthimala and Sunil Dutt in the lead with Leela Chitnis, Radhakrishan, Manmohan Krishna, Uma Dutt, Ravikant forms an ensemble cast. The story, screenplay and dialogue was penned by Mukhram Sharma. The film revolves around Rajini (Vyjayanthimala), a prostitute's love affair with a professor (Sunil Dutt).   The film has a theme on the rehabilitation of prostitutes which was then a controversial topic. Furthermore, the film also questioned on the society of prostitution. The story revolves around professor Mohan who lives with his ailing mother and his mother would like him to get married but he oppose for this. Suddenly his mother loses consciousness and is not expected to live long and only way the son has to save her is to get married. So he brings a woman Rajini who is then introduced to his mother. Now His mother's health improves and his mother is so pleased with Rajini that she even gives her the family jewels. Then the mother and son receive the shattering news that the Rajini is actually a prostitute. Professor Mohan (Sunil Dutt) is a morally upright, honest young man living with his beloved mother (Leela Chitnis), who is singleminded in her pursuit of one goal. Mohan teaches literature and poetry at a nearby college. During one lesson about a nobleman who has fallen for a prostitute, he makes his feelings about dancing girls quite clear. Not long after, his mother, who is running a fever, falls down the stairs in their home and is unconscious. The doctor is called, injections are given, the neighbors all come crowding in, and much shaking of the head ensues, but she finally regains her senses long enough to say this. The doctor pronounces his judgment that with the medication, she will get better; but the packed-in neighbors are much more gloomy. They all file out, still muttering amongst themselves. One of the neighbors, Jeevan (Radhakrishan), has creditors hounding him, and he sees a little opportunity to make some money. He tells Mohan that he knows a girl who might be persuaded to pose as his fiancee for a few days, but her father will probably want money. Mohan of course is willing at this point to do anything and agrees to give Jeevan whatever he wants. Jeevan goes to see Champabai, a local tawaif. He negotiates a price with her for posing as Mohan\u2019s fiancee for the evening. She puts on a demure sari and he takes her to see his mother and meet Mohan. His mother wakes up long enough to bless her before falling back into a deep sleep. Champa for her part is unimpressed by either mother or son and mocks them when she gets home. Jeevan gives her money, which is promptly pocketed by the brothel owner Lallubhai. The next day Mohan's mom asks to see \"Rajani\" again, and Mohan asks Jeevan to bring her again that evening\u2014Jeevan has told Mohan that she is the daughter of a distant relative. In any case, Champa/Rajani is bowled over by the expensive jewelry that Mohan's mom shows her as the family bride-to-be. She decides to forgo her fee, to Jeevan\u2019s dismay, in favor of pretending to have real feelings for Mohan until she can find an opportunity to steal it. She soon does, as one day Mohan's mom gives her the bridal sari and jewelry to take home and try on. She puts on her finery for her customers that evening, and they make fun of her. She flees in humiliation and the jewels she put on so happily moments before now feel like they are scalding her. Her customers sing a lively qawwali to try and coax her out. But when she emerges, this time in her dance costume, they laugh at her again and she realizes that she means nothing to them, they don\u2019t think of her as a person with feelings or emotions. The next day, subdued, she brings back the jewelry and bridal sari to Ma, who is recovering nicely. Ma\u2019s warm greeting and kind affection makes her feel even worse. Meanwhile, Mohan has fallen for Rajani, and he wants to speak to her father. Jeevan puts him off, and he returns home to find Rajani there. He expresses his affection gently, and she tells him that she is not worthy. She leaves sadly, and the next evening refuses to dance for her customers. Lallu\u2019s threats don\u2019t move her either, and she throws him out after an impassioned speech about how he has been living off her earnings for years. He goes, but vows that he will make her dance in the bazaar. She goes to see Jeevan and makes him promise that he won\u2019t tell Mohan the truth about her, not because she thinks she has a future with him, but because she can\u2019t bear to become a lesser woman in his eyes. Soon after that, Mohan sees Rajani walking in the street. When he calls her name she flees, and he follows her to her house. Mohan is horrified and angry. He tells his bewildered mother that he will never see Rajani again. For the lead role of Champabai, who is a prostitute, the initial consideration for that role was actress Nimmi, but she hesitated to enact a role of a prostitute and reject the offer which was instrumental in her career decline by the late 1950s. Later, actress Vyjayanthimala who previously worked with B.R. Chopra in Naya Daur (1957) agreed to be part of the film immediately after hearing the script from the director. Furthermore, Yash Chopra, the younger brother of B.R. Chopra, was an assistant director during the making of Sadhna. B. R. Chopra later gave him his break as a director the next year with Dhool Ka Phool (1959). The film's soundtrack was compose by Datta Naik who had a break through this album. Later on he composed some of the best Bollywood songs in the film Dhool Ka Phool (1957) and Aag Aur Daag (1970). The lyrics were provided by Sahir Ludhianvi and the vocal's were provided by Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammed Rafi, Bhupinder Singh, Geeta Dutt and Asha Bhosle. Sadhna received largely positive reviews from the critics and was one of the most critically acclaimed film of the year. Vijay Lokapally from The Hindu said, \"Among the great movies made on the subject of helpless women versus society, Sadhna holds its own for its realistic portrayal and treatment of a subject, so aesthetically documented by Chopra and Vyjayanthimala\". While actress Vyjayanthimala was praised by the reviewer whose performance was described as \"gorgeous when she entertains the clients at her kotha\" and \"stunningly restrained when she assumes the character of a prospective wife\". Adding to that, \"she slips in and out of the two challenging and contrasting roles with \u00e9lan, a remarkable feat for an artiste who was only 22 and hardly 10-films old when she signed to play this difficult but decisive role in her dazzling career\" and concluded that \"the movie is all about Vyjayanthimala\u2019s skills as a dancer and an actor[...]is captivating in her dancing numbers[...]The Filmfare Award for Best Actress that year could not have gone to anyone else even though she was also nominated in the same category for Madhumati.\" Similarly, the Rediff's reviewer Dinesh Raheja has commented that, \"Sadhna was quite progressive in its approach, boldly dealt with a prostitute's love story with a literature professor[...]it dared to portray not just the often seen tragic trajectory of a prostitute's life and times, but a happy ending as well\". Furthermore Raheja added that, \"Though Chopra's narrative style is conventional, he needs to be commended for attempting a reformist tale\". The music director Datta Naik and the lyricist Sahir Ludhianvi was praised for their involvement, especially the \"Aurat Ne Janam Diya Mardon Ko\" was described as \"crowning glory\" and \"hair-raising\" song of the film. At the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed around \u20b916,000,000 with nett gross of \u20b98,000,000, thus becomes the fifth highest grossing film of 1958 with verdict hit at box office. According to Ibosnetwork.com, the film had been grossed at about 8,000,000 and its adjust to inflation gross is about \u20b9 2,134\u00a0million. The film was the second direct box office hit film for the B. R. Films banner after Naya Daur (1957). After Sadhna which made Chopra financially the most-viable banner, the top heroes and heroines were prepared to work with him at half their remuneration for the box office guarantee offered by his banner.",

The picture tells the story of Nehalata (Sridevi), a young woman who regresses to childhood after suffering a head injury in a car crash. Lost, she ends up trapped in a brothel before being rescued by Somu (Kamal Haasan), a lonely school teacher who falls in love with her. The film is a remake of the 1982 of Balu Mahendra's own Tamil Film Moondram Pirai, starring Sridevi and Kamal Hassan. Sridevi's autistic child-woman performance was widely praised and is considered one of the finest performances and also brought her nominations in the Filmfare Best actress award category as well as State awards and National Awards. Kamal's performance in the film's climax won him the National Award in the Tamil original. The film flopped at the box-office,but as a film-it achieved cult status and is regarded as an all time classic featuring Kamal Haasan and Sridevi's best performances. Sridevi's role was initially offered to Dimple Kapadia, but she could not accept the role due to other commitments.   Nehalata (Sridevi) is a young, modern girl who meets with an accident. The parents are concerned as their daughter is unable to recognise them. The doctor diagnoses her with retrograde amnesia that leaves her with the memory and intelligence of a six or seven-year-old.

The sub-plot of the film follows the wife of Somu's boss who is attracted to Somu, though Somu doesn't reciprocate her feelings. It depicts how the outside world succumbs to carnal desires which have no place in Somu and Reshmi's relationship. Somu takes Reshmi to the village's medical practitioner who cures her and brings her back to sanity as she regains her memory up to the point of her accident. She boards a train that day back home with her parents. When Somu comes to meet Reshmi later that day, she is unable to identify or remember him. Despite his efforts to make her understand that he was the one who had taken care of her for several months, she is indifferent to him and leaves Ooty for her hometown, thus abandoning Somu and the life and relationship that she once had with him. All music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja, who retained most of his compositions from the original Tamil version except \"Vaanengum\" and \"Poongatru\". The film marked the composer's debut in Bollywood. Sadma is included in iDiva's list of '10 Must Watch Movies That Weren't Blockbusters'.

It won one Filmfare Awards and four BFJA Awards. Rajesh Khanna received nomination for BFJA Awards for Best Actor (Hindi).Asit Sen remade the 1956 Bengali film Chalachal, which was directed by him, in Hindi as Safar (1970). As per review by critics, Safar was carried more than ably by Khanna\u2019s immense charm at the peak of his popularity.Rajesh Khanna beautifully conveys his character's desperation and his conviction that surviving by a slender thread is not really living.This film is counted among the 17 consecutive hit films Rajesh Khanna between 1969 and 1971, by adding the two hero films Marayada and Andaz to the 15 consecutive solo hits he gave from 1969 to 1971. The movie is a remake of director's own 1956 Bengali movie Chalachal.   Movie starts with the desperate attempt of surgeon Dr.Neela (Sharmila Tagore) to save a patient, who she knew wasn't going to survive. She works under the guidance of Dr. Chandra (Ashok Kumar) who tells her that however hard doctors might try, sometimes a patient wouldn't survive. The story drifts into flashback. Neela meets Avinash (Rajesh Khanna) at medical college and after an initial misunderstanding, grows close to him. Avinash is a poor guy who works while attending medical college. He paints too and Neela finds out that most of his paintings are of her. Though he admires Neela very much, he never talks about love or marriage. Everyone thinks that it's because of his financial status, but it is later revealed that he has terminal cancer. Neela, due to financial troubles, starts working as a tutor where she meets her student's elder brother, businessman Shekhar Kapoor (Feroz Khan). Shekhar admires her and later meets his elder brother Kalidas (I. S. Johar) to ask her hand in marriage. Kalidas redirects him to Avinash saying that Neela would listen to him. Shekhar meets Avinash who approves of him and recommends him to Neela. Neela understands that Avinash has no intention to marry her, so she agrees to marry Shekhar. They spend some time happily but Shekhar always feels Neela wouldn't love him as much as he loves her. Facing losses in business, he expects Neela's empathy but gets none. Moreover, Neela regularly visits her brother's house where Avinash was a frequent visitor. Shekhar slowly grows suspicious of Neela and Avinash and asks his younger brother to spy on her. Later he finds a love letter, written by Avinash in the handwriting of Neela just for fun. Shekhar thinks that Neela has written that and becomes devastated. He wants to free her from him and commits suicide. Police suspects that Neela and Avinash killed him and arrests Neela as Avinash disappears. At the trial, Shekhar's mother Mrs Kapoor (Nadira) testifies in favour of Neela and the court acquits her. Later it is revealed that Avinash left to get away from their marital lives not knowing that Shekhar had committed suicide. Later he comes back in the final stage of his disease and dies in Dr Chandra's hospital. Heart-broken and devastated, Neela wouldn't want to live anymore but Dr.Chandra consoles and takes her under his wing to make her a great surgeon like him. The film ends with Neela sending her brother-in-law abroad for studies and dedicating her life to medical profession.

Safar became the tenth highest grossing film of the year in India. In a retrospective review, Rediff.com wrote, \"Safar is a story of ordinary people grappling with staggering challenges and compromises. But in this refreshingly non-melodramatic fare, a murmur of protest, an escaped sob and a half-concealed smirk are the only emotional luxuries its characters afford themselves in the inexplicable journey of life, the eponymous safar of the title.\" Safar received two nominations at the annual Filmfare Awards and won one award. Asit Sen received his first Best Director award (he was previously nominated in this category for Mamta in 1967), though the film was not nominated for the Best Film award. Sharmila Tagore received her second Best Actress nomination (she won the previous year for Aradhana). Awards and nominations are listed below: The Bengal Film Journalists' Association acknowledged Safar as the eighth best Indian film of 1970, and gave it three more awards: The soundtrack of the film contains 5 songs.

The film stars Guru Dutt, Meena Kumari, Rehman, Waheeda Rehman and Nazir Hussain. The film was a major critical and commercial success, with critics attributing it to Meena Kumari's performance as Chhoti Bahu, which is regarded as one of the best performances of Hindi cinema. It won four Filmfare Awards, including Best Movie award, was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 13th Berlin International Film Festival, and was chosen as India's official entry to the Oscars. However it was not accepted as a nominee. The academy wrote a letter to Guru Dutt saying a woman who drinks was not a permissible taboo in their culture. Indiatimes Movies ranks it amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films.   The film opens at the ruins of an old haveli in Calcutta, where a group of labourers are busy pulling down what remains. When the workers break off for lunch, the overseer (Guru Dutt) wanders through the haveli. As he sits at a place there begins a flashback to the end of the 19th century. The lower-class and educated Bhoothnath arrives in colonial Calcutta looking for work. He lives in the grand haveli of the Choudhurys, a family of zamindars with his Brother-in-Law. He works at the Mohini Sindoor factory run by Subinay Babu, a dedicated member of the Brahmo Samaj. Subinay Babu's daughter Jaba (Waheeda Rehman) is amused by Bhoothnath whom she considers an unsophisticated rustic. Bhoothnath becomes fascinated with the goings-on in the haveli and every night observes the decadent lifestyle of the Choudhury brothers. One night the servant, Bansi (Dhumal), takes Bhoothnath to meet the younger zamindar's (Rehman) wife Chhoti Bahu (Meena Kumari) who implores him to bring her Mohini Sindoor believing it will keep her unfaithful husband home. Bhoothnath is struck by her beauty and sadness and inadvertently becomes Chhoti Bahu's secret confidante. A bomb explodes in the marketplace and Bhoothnath is injured in the ensuing crossfire between freedom fighters and British soldiers. Jaba looks after him. Chhoti Bahu's repeated attempts to appease her husband fail until she becomes his drinking companion to keep him by her side. Jaba's marriage is finalised with Supavitra (a member of Bramho Samaj) but after her father's death she declined the marriage. Bhoothnath becomes a trainee architect and goes away to work on a training project. After his return he find the haveli in partial ruins. Chhoti Bahu is now a desperate alcoholic and her husband, paralysed. Meanwhile, he learns that he and Jaba were betrothed as children. One night Chhoti Bahu asks Bhoothnath to accompany her to a nearby shrine to pray for her ailing husband. Their conversation is heard by the elder zamindar, Majhle Babu (Sapru), who suspects that Chhoti Bahu is having an affair with Bhootnath (though really it was not). He orders his henchmen to chase them. As Bhoothnath and Chhoti Bahu travel in the carriage, it is stopped by the henchmen. Bhoothnath is knocked unconscious and Chhoti Bahu is abducted. When he wakes up in hospital, Bhoothnath is told Chhoti Bahu has disappeared and the younger zamindar is dead. The flashback ends. Bhoothnath's workers inform him a skeleton is found buried in the ruins of the haveli. From the jewellery on the corpse, Bhoothnath realises it is the remains of Chhoti Bahu. The last scene shows a nostalgic Bhoothnath riding away on a carriage with Jaba, who is now his wife. In this, the filmed version departs significantly from the novel, where Jaba and Bhoothnath do not get a happy ending. The film also depicts the decline of the old landed zamindari families of Bengal during the 19th century. Nargis Dutt and then photographer Jitendra Arya's wife Chhaya Arya were considered for the role of Chhoti Bahu but eventually the role went to Meena Kumari as to brought the necessary pathos for which she had been famous. Guru Dutt wanted S.D. Burman and Sahir Ludhianvi for the music and lyrics but SD Burman was unwell and Sahir declined the offer. Shashi Kapoor was the first choice for the role of Bhootnath, losing it when he showed up two-and-a-half hours late for a meeting with Guru Dutt and Abrar Alvi. The next choice was Bengali actor Biswajeet, whose Hindi film debut it would have been. Biswajeet backed out because he didn't want to be tied into an exclusive contract with Guru Dutt. Finally, Guru Dutt cast himself as Bhootnath, the Ghulam. Waheeda Rehman wanted to play the role of Chhoti Bahu. She even did a look test but the photographer V.K. Murthy realised that she was too young for the mature role. However, when Alvi offered her the role of Jaba, she accepted it despite the fact that it was a secondary role to Meena Kumari. Guru Dutt felt the role didn't go with her box office status and forewarned her that her name would come after Meena Kumari's in the credits but Waheeda wanted to be a part of the movie and she did the role. The film was shot at Dhankuria Mansion near Calcutta but Meena Kumari didn't come to the haveli, its interiors were recreated on a set in Bombay. The controversy about who directed Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam has increased over the years. Since the film is characteristic of Guru Dutt's feel and style, it is difficult to think that he did not direct the film. However, Dutt never denied Abrar Alvi's role in the film nor did he make any counter claims when Alvi won the Filmfare Award for Best Director for the film. Alvi has stated that Dutt did direct the songs but not the film in its entirety. The editor, Y.G. Chawan, says that it was Alvi who sat with him. \"Abrar worked so hard on that film but he never got any credit. People say it was produced by Guru Dutt so it had to be Guru Dutt's film.\" Waheeda Rehman, one of the film's stars, also confirmed that it was Alvi, not Dutt, who directed it. The music of the film was composed by Hemant Kumar. Shakeel Badayuni wrote the lyrics. The song \"Sahil Ki Taraf Kashti Le Chal\" was edited out of the film. The song had a shot which showed Chhoti Bahu resting her head on Bhoothnath's lap in the carriage. Audiences reacted sharply to this so Guru Dutt removed the song and the 'offending shot' changing the carriage scene to a dialogue exchange between Chhoti Bahu and Bhoothnath. He also shot an additional scene with the paralysed husband repenting his sinful and debauched lifestyle. Hemant Kumar reused the tune for the song \"Ya Dil ki Suno\" from Anupama (1966). Besides being a commercial success, the film was a huge critical success. To quote the review featured in The Times of India dated 24 June 1962: The well-knit screenplay, achieving an effective balance between the various characters and emotional phases, provides a neat dramatic pattern. It appears to be a specially successful job considering the verbosity and digressiveness of the novel of Mr. Bimal Mitra who, though often brilliant, writes in a highly disorderly way. Upperstall.com commented, \"Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam is a romantic and somewhat nostalgic tale of a bygone era. The film is a magnificent and sombre work with heightened atmosphere, rich dialogues, haunting cinematography, extraordinary song picturizations and brilliant performances.\" It also praised Meena Kumari's performance: \"While each of the performances are spot on, if there is one person who is the heart and soul of the film, it is Meena Kumari. Her portrayal of Chhoti Bahu is perhaps the greatest performance ever seen on the Indian Screen. The sequence where Chhoti Bahu dresses for her husband singing Piya Aiso Jiya Main is a poignant exploration of a woman's expectations and sexual desire. And later on when she has become a desperate alcoholic, you cannot help but cry with her in the sequence where she pleads with her husband to stay with her and then angrily turns on him to tell him how she has prostituted her basic values and morals to please him. However the common factors between the actress's life and Chhoti Bahu are too dramatic to be merely coincidental \u2013 The estranged marital relationship, the taking of alcohol, turning towards younger male company, the craving to be understood and loved \u2013 all elements evident in Meena Kumari's own life.\" Indiatimes Movies, while listing it as one of the \"25 Must See Bollywood Movies,\" wrote, \"The film remains with you forever simply because of the splendid performance of Meena Kumari.\"",

        "full_text": " Salaam Bombay! is a 1988 Hindi film directed by Mira Nair, and screenwritten by her longtime creative collaborator, Sooni Taraporevala. The film chronicles the day-to-day life of children living on the streets of Bombay, India's biggest city. It won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi, the National Board of Review Award for Top Foreign Film, the Golden Camera and Audience Awards at the Cannes Film Festival, and three awards at the Montr\u00e9al World Film Festival. The film was India's second film submission to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The film was among the list of \"The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\" by the New York Times.   Before the start of the film, Krishna has set fire to his bullying elder brother's motor-bike. This has landed him in big trouble with his mother. She has taken him to the nearby Apollo Circus and told him that he can only come home when he earns 500 rupees to pay for the damaged bike. Krishna agrees and works for the circus. The film begins as the circus is packing up to move on. His boss asks him to run an errand, but when Krishna returns, he finds that the circus has left. Alone, with nowhere to turn, and without the money to repay his mother, he travels to the nearest big city, Bombay. As soon as he arrives, he is robbed of his few possessions. He follows the thieves, befriends them, and ends up in the city's notorious red-light area of Falkland Road, near the Grant Road Railway Station. One of the thieves, Chillum, a drug pusher and addict, helps Krishna to get a job at the Grant Road Tea Stall. Baba, a local drug dealer, employs people like Chillum who are addicted to his drugs. His wife is also a prostitute and they have a little daughter. Baba's wife is annoyed that she has to raise her daughter in such an environment. Baba earlier promised to start a new life elsewhere, but it is a promise which Baba cannot, or has no intention of fulfilling. Krishna gets a new name, \"Chaipau\", and learns to live with it. His goal is still to get the money he needs to return home to his mother, but he soon finds out that saving money in his new surroundings is next to impossible. To make matters worse, he has a crush on a young girl named Sola Saal, who has been recently sold to the brothel. He sets fire to her room and attempts to escape with her, but the two are caught. Sola Saal, who is considered valuable property since she is still a virgin, denies starting the fire and tearfully tries to resist her enslavement. The madame of the house asks Baba to 'break her into' the business, which Baba agrees to do. The fire causes Krishna to get a severe beating, and he loses his job. He works odd jobs to feed himself and look after Chillum, who can't live without drugs. To get more money, Krishna and his pals rob an elderly Parsi man by breaking into his house in broad daylight. Krishna eventually checks on the 300 rupees he has saved, and finds out that they had been stolen by Chillum who had used them to buy drugs, which he then overdosed on and died. One night while returning home from work, the boys and Baba's daughter are apprehended by the police and taken to a juvenile home. Eventually, Krishna escapes and goes back to his world. He finds a new recruit in Baba's drug business has taken Chillum's place and name. Baba's wife is told that the authorities will not release their daughter, because the mother is a prostitute. Krishna meets Sola Saal and tries to convince her to run away with him. She reveals that she is charmed by Baba and not interested in Krishna; she is driven away to service her first 'client'. In a fit of rage, Krishna kills Baba, and attempts to run away with Baba's wife, but they become separated in a parade honoring Ganesh. Most of the young actors who appeared in Salaam Bombay! were actual street children. They received dramatic training at a special workshop in Bombay before they appeared in the film. In 1989, director Mira Nair established an organization called the Salaam Baalak Trust, to rehabilitate the children who appeared in the film. Most of them were eventually helped. The Trust is still in existence, and now lends support to street children in Bombay, Delhi and Bhubaneshwar. Shafiq Syed, who played the role of Krishna in the movie now earns his living as an autorickshaw driver in Bangalore. Salaam Bombay! earned $2,080,046 in the United States and Canada.",

        "full_text": " Sangam (Confluence) is a 1964 Bollywood Romance film written by Inder Raj Anand, produced and directed by Raj Kapoor. The film stars Vyjayanthimala in the lead role opposite Raj Kapoor and Rajendra Kumar with Iftekhar, Raj Mehra, Nana Palsikar, Lalita Pawar, Achala Sachdev and Hari Shivdasani appearing in supporting roles. Sangam was Raj Kapoor's first colour film, distinguished by its technicolor and epic length (even by Bollywood standards). It is also considered the Magnum Opus or best work of Raj Kapoor. It became a hit in India and is considered a classic today. One of the features of the film that became widely used later on in Bollywood is the use of foreign locales for on-location shooting, such as Venice, Paris, and Switzerland. This started the Bollywood trend of shooting songs sequences abroad (primarily in Switzerland), against the background of \"exotic\" landscapes. Director Dasari Narayana Rao remade the film in Telugu and Kannada languages as Swapna.   Sundar (Raj Kapoor), Gopal (Rajendra Kumar) and Radha (Vyjayantimala) have been friends since childhood. As they grow into adults, Sundar develops an obsessive romantic attraction to Radha, but she prefers Gopal, who is also in love with her. Yet, as Sundar has confided his feelings for Radha to him, Gopal decides to sacrifice his love for his friend's sake. Radha systematically resists Sundar's overtures, but to no avail. For him, she is the only woman in the world. Matching Sundar's great love for Radha is his unswerving devotion to his friendship with Gopal. Eventually, Sundar enlists in the Indian Air Force and is assigned to a military mission in Kashmir. Before leaving, he extracts a promise from Gopal, whom he trusts implicitly, never to let any man come between Radha and himself while he is away. Subsequently, Sundar's aircraft is shot down over Kashmir. He is listed as MIA and presumed dead. This news saddens Radha and Gopal, but they are nonetheless now free to profess their love for one another. Among other expressions of love, Gopal writes her an unsigned prem patra (love letter) which touches her particularly and which she hides away. Just when they begin taking steps to be married, Sundar returns, safe and sound. The self-effacing Gopal sacrifices himself once more, stepping back into the shadows, watching as the reborn Sundar resumes his wooing of Radha. Inevitably, the two marry. After the couple returns from an extended European honeymoon, Sundar is deliriously happy. His life's dream has been realised. Radha is resolved to be faithful to her husband and to put Gopal out of her mind. She privately asks him to stay away from her and Sundar because of the torture his presence causes her. Sundar's devotion to Gopal, however, is such that he constantly tries to draw him into their life, much to Radha's chagrin. The perfection of their marital bliss is, however, shattered when Sundar accidentally discovers the unsigned love letter Gopal had written to Radha. Sundar is thunderstruck, and assumes that Radha has been unfaithful to him. Producing a pistol, he demands she divulge the name of the supposed lover and threatens to kill the man, but she refuses. In the days that follow, Sundar becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of the letter's author and cannot return to normalcy. Radha's life becomes miserable, lived out against the incessant drama of Sundar's jealousy, threats, anger and fixation with the letter. Eventually unable to bear the wretchedness of her existence with Sundar any further, Radha flees to Gopal for help. Sundar takes the same route, unaware that Radha has gone to Gopal's house. There, matters come to a head. The overwrought Gopal admits his authorship of the infamous letter to Radha, an admission which almost destroys his friend. Gopal, perceiving no exit from the impasse at which the three have arrived, kills himself with Sundar's pistol. Radha and Sundar are finally reunited \u2013 in mourning. This love triangle is a psychologically multifaceted tale about male bonding, the meaning of love and friendship. In the context of these relationships, Sundar is the one who is preventing the other two people's happiness and finally also thwarts his own. He appears as being naive and innocent, yet he seems adamant at only noticing things that suit his mindset. He is full of self-pity and bullies the others emotionally. An important and critically regarded theme in the film is male bonding and the informal sharing of a woman between two male friends. Gopal indulges in his own \"sacrifice\", but never thinks of the woman's feelings he ostensibly loves. In the late 1940s, Raj Kapoor planned to launch a film under the title of Gharonda with Dilip Kumar, Nargis and himself in the lead playing the central characters. The story was penned by Inder Raj Anand during the making of Kapoor's first directional film, Aag (1948). However the film was postponed for several reasons and was in development hell until 1962 where it was titled as Sangam with new cast and crews. Initially Dilip Kumar was approached by Kapoor to play the role of Gopal Verma. Kumar agreed to play either one of the two male role with condition that he was given the right to edit the final copy of the film. Since Kapoor could not accept Kumar's condition, then approached Dev Anand for the role. The latter also declined the role citing call sheet problems as reason. Soon Rajendra Kumar was finalised for the role. The music for this film was composed by Shankar Jaikishan while the songs were written by Shailendra and Hasrat Jaipuri. The soundtrack was listed by Planet Bollywood as number 8 on their list of 100 Greatest Bollywood Soundtracks. Sangam was a success at the box office. Boxofficeindia.com reported the film had collected \u20b980,000,000 and its nett collection, \u20b940,000,000. Similarly, Boxofficeindia.co.in reported the film had the same box office collection while its adjust to inflation by comparing the collection with the price of Gold in 1964 is about \u20b97,173,154,362 (US$110\u00a0million). On contrary to the both report, Ibosnetwork.com claim that Sangam grossed around \u20b950,000,000 with its adjust to inflation grossed to \u20b97,602,400,000 (US$120\u00a0million). By the end of its overall box office collection, Sangam was labelled as blockbuster at the box office where it was the highest-grossing film of the year. Furthermore, Sangam also ranked as second highest-grossing film of the decade by Boxofficeindia.com behind Mughal-e-Azam where its adjusted to inflation nett gross reportedly is about \u20b9885,700,000 (US$14\u00a0million). The film was also ranked at fourth by Boxofficeindia.co.in in their list of \"Top 50 Film of Last 50 Years\" which feature all-time highest grossing Bollywood film by using the relative price of gold in different years to arrive at a hypothetical current value of box-office collections of past films.",

John started working on Sarfarosh in 1992. Seven years were spent on the research, pre-production and production till it finally released in 1999. The film deals with an Indian police officer's quest towards cross-border terrorism. The film was released at the time of the Kargil conflict when tensions between India and Pakistan were high. The film was critically praised and was commercially successful at the box office. The film won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment, the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film, and was screened at the International Film Festival of India. The film was remade in Kannada as Sathyameva Jayathe with Devaraj and in Telugu as Astram (2006) with Vishnu Manchu and Anushka Shetty.   Arms trafficking is taking place in India. An arsenal enters Indian territory via the state of Rajasthan, which makes its way to interior of India with help of many middlemen. Bala Thakur, a gun handler in Chandrapur, provides the arms to Veeran, a forest dwelling brigand. Later, Veeran and his gang attack a wedding bus, mercilessly gunning down every person in it which includes women and children. The government appoints a Special Action Team in Mumbai to trace the roots behind the attack. The team learns about Bala Thakur, but thanks to his informants, Thakur flees before he can be apprehended. Meanwhile, ACP Ajay Singh Rathod, a resident of Mumbai, is attending a concert by the famed ghazal singer Gulfam Hassan (a Muhajir), where he spots a familiar face, Seema. Ajay had a crush over Seema when they were studying in Delhi, but never got the courage to propose to her. The duo are happy to meet each other again and gradually fall in love. Gulfam, on the other hand, is Indian by birth, but had to move to Pakistan as a child during partition. Deeply scarred due to the experience, he is still happy that the Government allows him to live in his palatial residence whenever he comes to India. Gulfam finds a huge fan in Ajay, who used to attend his programs as a child. Despite the age difference, the two bond. Inspector Salim a Muslim inspector is taken off from the Special Action Team when a notorious gangster Sultan escapes his clutches and he is severely reprimanded his superior for this failure and for cuing the death of three other officers in the attempt. Despite being an honest and upright police officer with the best intelligence gathering network in the force, Salim is rueful that he is being given second class treatment because he is a Muslim and is being perceived as having let Sultan escape because he was a Muslim as well. His anger at the system doesn't lessen when Ajay, who was his junior, is told to head the team. Ajay wants Salim on the team, but Salim refuses. It is revealed that Ajay's father was going to testify against some terrorist who had threatened him not to testify, but in an attempt to stop them from doing so, Ajay's elder brother was killed. Ajay's father was kidnapped and by the time the terrorists spared him, the man had lost his voice. This motivated Ajay to join the police force. Unknown to Ajay, Gulfam is also working for the Pakistani intelligence which is attempting to create havoc in India and create a proxy war between both sides. Since Gulfam likes Ajay, he sees to it that nothing untoward happens to him. Here, Salim finds the location of Bala Thakur along with the information that Sultan, the man who escaped from his clutches, will also be there. Salim gives the information to Ajay who makes peace with Salim and convinces him to join the team again. An encounter at the criminals' rendezvous results in the death of Bala Thakur and Ajay is seriously injured. Though Sultan and his right-hand man Shiva manage to escape, the operation is deemed a success as the team is able to intercept a large consignment of lethal arms and ammunition meant for terrorist Veeran and his terrorist acts around the country. Sultan is later assassinated on Gulfams orders because of his failure and false information is leaked that he has escaped to Pakistan. While recuperating, Ajay has an epiphany which leads the team to Bahid in Rajasthan and to \"Mirchi Seth\" Rambandhu Gupt. The investigative team save for Ajay and Salim camp in Bahid and gather all possible information on Mirchi Seth. Ajay comes over to Bahid to investigate and meets Gulfam who is temporarily staying in his ancestral manor near Bahid. Gulfam attempts to derail the investigation through political means and ordering an assault on Ajay to subvert the investigation, but of no avail. The repeated failures on Gulfam's part displease the senior officers in Pakistani Intelligence, who dispatch Major Aslam Baig to take care of the business. Here, Ajay goes through the information collected so far and realises that he has seen many key suspects near Gulfam, but fails to make the connection. The investigative teams prepares for a final assault on the gun-running operation and in the pursuit of Mirchi Seth land up at Gulfam's mansion. Ajay feels betrayed when he learns of Gulfam's treachery, but is aware of lack of substantial evidence to indict Gulfam for his crimes. He goads and tricks Gulfam into killing Baig and arrests him for the offence. After realising what happened, Gulfam reveals how the incidents that happened during the partition embittered him and why he did those deeds. In retaliation, Ajay makes him realise that his actions are not benefiting people of any religion. After Ajay makes him see the error in his ways, Gulfam, unable to stand the humiliation and guilt, commits suicide. Gulfam's suicide is hushed up and the team returns triumphant to Mumbai to much accolades for busting the terrorist racket. At Mumbai Airport, Salim is tipped on the whereabouts of Veeran and Ajay embarks on another investigation with his team. Upon theatrical release, Sarfarosh received praised by the critics. Naseeruddin Shah was specially praised for his role of a Muhajir. The reviewer for Filmfare rated the film four out of five and wrote, \"What makes this film so exceptional is its carefully thought out characterization and brilliant performances.

        "full_text": " Sarkar (Hindi: \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930, translation: Overlord) is a 2005 Indian political crime thriller film written and directed by Ram Gopal Varma. The film stars Amitabh Bachchan in the title role alongside Abhishek Bachchan as the younger son, Shankar Nagre, along with Kay Kay Menon, Katrina Kaif, Anupam Kher, Kota Srinivasa Rao, Supriya Pathak and Tanisha Mukherjee. It is the first installment of Sarkar film series. The movie is inspired from The Godfather. Along with film's sequel, Sarkar Raj, released on 6 June 2008, the film was archived at the American Academy of Motion Pictures library. The blockbuster film was premi\u00e8red at the New York Asian Film Festival.   Subhash Nagre (Amitabh Bachchan), who is known by his followers as Sarkar, lives in Mumbai. The opening scenes show a rape victim's father (Veerendra Saxena) approaching Sarkar for justice (which the corrupt law and order system has failed to deliver) which Sarkar promptly establishes by having the rapist beaten up by his henchmen. His son, Vishnu (Kay Kay Menon), plays a sleazy producer who is more interested in the film actress Sapna (Nisha Kothari) than his wife Amrita (Rukhsar). Sarkar's other, more upright son, Shankar (Abhishek Bachchan), returns from the United States with his love Pooja (Katrina Kaif) after completing his education there. Pooja's doubts about Sarkar's image cause Shankar, who firmly believes in his father's righteousness, to break up with her later in the movie. One day, a Dubai-based don, Rasheed (Zakir Hussain) tries to strike a deal with Sarkar; he promptly refuses on moral grounds and also forbids him from doing it himself. Rasheed tries to eliminate Sarkar's supremacy with the help of Selvar Mani (Kota Srinivasa Rao), Sarkar's former associate, Vishram Bhagat and Swami Virendra (Jeeva). Meanwhile, they trap Sarkar by assassinating a righteous, upright, Ahimsa political leader and an outspoken critic of Sarkar, Motilal Khurana (Anupam Kher), and frame Sarkar for the murder. Everyone, including Vishnu believe that Sarkar is guilty but Shankar has deep faith in his father. Sarkar gets arrested and is imprisoned. Shankar now takes over the position of Sarkar temporarily. On learning of a plot to murder his father in prison, he approaches the police commissioner (Anant Jog) and asks him to arrange stronger security for his father, only for the commissioner to mock Shankar and his father besides not providing protection. Shankar gets a feeling that the police commissioner wants Sarkar to get murdered. Shankar and Khansaab, one of Sarkar's men, try to ask Selvar Mani for help to prevent possible murder, but Mani ultimately betrays them when he reveals that he is in an alliance with Rasheed. Rasheed prepares to kill Shankar and Khansaab but only Khansaab is killed when he decides to sacrifice himself for Shankar. By the time Shankar reaches the prison and appropriate action is taken, the attempt on Sarkar's life is already made. Sarkar is later acquitted. He remains bedridden as Shankar takes on Sarkar's enemies. Meanwhile, Selvar Mani, Swami, Vishram and Rasheed try to convince Vishnu to murder Sarkar. Vishnu was previously thrown out of Sarkar's house because he had murdered the actor who was having an affair with Sapna. Vishnu returns home pretending to have repented. When he approaches Sarkar in the dark of the night with the intent of murdering him, Shankar foils his plan and later kills him (establishing justice by the way of his father and not shown in the film but viewer can guess after watching sequel/s). Shankar eliminates Rasheed, Vishram and Selvar Mani. He also succeeds in making Swami his puppet. Shankar has also realised that Chief Minister Madan Rathore (Deepak Shirke) was really behind everything; he had instructed Rasheed to murder Sarkar.This results in legal action against the Chief Minister. The closing scenes shows a woman approaching Shankar for justice to a fake encounter of her husband by the police and calling Shankar the Sarkar, while Subash is busy with family. Sarkar was superhit at the box office and was greeted very well by critics. Critics liked the way the movie indigenised The Godfather and introduced a political angle to it. The actors, particularly the trio of Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan and Kay Kay Menon, were lavished with praise for their controlled yet intense performances. Abhishek Bachchan in particular, was rewarded for his portrayal as a son who is inexperienced but enters an unknown world so as to save his father. He won the following awards: The music of the film is composed by Bapi and muhatir choudhary. Lyrics are penned by Sandeep Nath. and muhatir choudhary A Telugu remake, titled Rowdy was made replacing the background of Marathi politics with that of South Indian factionism. Veteran actor Mohan Babu reprised the role portrayed by Amitabh Bachchan while his son Vishnu Manchu reprised the role played by Abhishek Bachchan. Rowdy released on 4 April 2014 to positive reviews from critics but was a moderate commercial success, grossing approximately Rs 8 Crores in its full run. A sequel titled Sarkar Raj was released on 6 June 2008 with Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan (who reprise their roles from the original) and new entrant Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. Supriya Pathak, Tanisha Mukherjee and Ravi Kale also reappeared in their respective roles from Sarkar. The film released on 6 June 2008, was critically and commercially successful.",

        "full_text": " Satya (lit. \"Truth\") is a 1998 Indian Hindi crime film directed by Ram Gopal Varma, and written by Saurabh Shukla and Anurag Kashyap. The film stars J. D. Chakravarthy, Manoj Bajpayee, Urmila Matondkar and Shefali Shah. The first film of the Indian Gangster Trilogy, tells the story of Satya, an immigrant who comes to Mumbai seeking his fortune but instead gets sucked into the Mumbai underworld. The film was show cased among the Indian panorama section, at the 1998 International Film Festival of India, the Fribourg International Film Festival, Switzerland, and the New York Asian Film Festival. The film was listed among CNN-IBN's 100 greatest Indian films of all time. In 2005, Indiatimes Movies included Satya in its list of 25 Must See Bollywood Movies. Made on a shoestring budget of INR 20\u00a0million Satya became a surprise hit at the box office of 1998. The film went on to win six Filmfare Awards, including the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie, four Star Screen Awards and Bollywood Movie Award \u2013 Best Director. Satya has been referred to as a modern masterpiece and it was considered one of the best films of the 1990s. It is also considered one of the best gangster films of all time. Film critic Rajeev Masand has labeled it (along with its sequel Company) one of the \"most influential movies of the past ten years.\" The film marked the introduction of a new genre of film making, a variation of film noir that has been called Mumbai noir, of which Varma is the acknowledged master.   Mumbai is in the midst of a turf war between two gangs, collectively referred to as the Mumbai underworld when Satya (J.D Chakravarthy), a man without a past, comes to the city looking for employment. While waiting tables at the local dance bar, he gets involved in a scuffle with Jagga (Jeeva), bag man for dreaded don Guru Narayan (Raju Mavani). Jagga takes his revenge by getting Satya arrested on false charges of pimping. In jail, Satya clashes with yet another member of Mumbai's mafia, underworld don Bhiku Mhatre (Manoj Bajpayee), who is in prison pending trial for the murder of a prominent film producer. Mhatre, pleased with Satya's bravado, extends a hand of friendship and arranges for his release as well as accommodation. With Mhatre's help, Satya avenges himself by gunning down Jagga in the very same dance bar and joins Mhatre's gang. Before branching out on his own, Mhatre was part of a gang that included himself, Guru Narayan, Kallu Mama (Shunyashish Mohanty) and lawyer Chandrakant Mule (Makrand Deshpande). Bhau Thakurdas Jhawle (Govind Namdeo), presently a corporator in the Mumbai Municipal Corporation, was the gang leader. After Jhawle joined politics, the gang split into two with Kallu and Mule joining Mhatre and Narayan going his own way. While the gangs had carved out their own territories which were off limits to the rival gang, both still maintained a relationship with Jhawle. Jagga's assassination breaks the uneasy truce and Narayan reneges on his promise by attacking Mhatre's gang when they are out on business. Mhatre decides to kill Narayan but is forced to abandon his project at the last moment on orders from Jhawle; the murder right on the eve of the municipal elections would have triggered a gang war and would be detrimental to Jhawle's political prospects. Meanwhile, Satya, who has risen up the ranks and become a key decision-maker in the gang, has met and fallen in love with Vidya (Urmila Matondkar), an aspiring playback singer who lives next door, but has not informed her of his underworld connections. At one point he even threatens a music director and gets him to sign her up for a project, with Vidya being unaware of the entire episode. Satya tells Mhatre, fuming over Jhawle's orders to stay away from Narayan, to ignore him and they assassinate Narayan. Mhatre is now the unchallenged ruler of the underworld and Jhawle, knowing that he needs Mhatre's help to win the elections, patches up with him. This is when the city sees the appointment of a new police commissioner, Amodh Shukla (Paresh Rawal). Shukla and his force begin targeting Mhatre's gang through encounters. Satya, seeing the situation getting out of hand, convinces the gang that the commissioner has to be eliminated and gets him killed. The police respond by intensifying the crackdown. Jhawle wins the elections thanks to Mhatre's muscle power as well as public anger on the brutal methods adopted by the police in its fight against organized crime. In the midst of this, Satya and Vidya decide to catch a movie. Inspector Khandilkar (Aditya Shrivastava), on the basis of a tipoff that Satya is present in the cinema hall, surrounds the premises and orders that all doors be shut. Satya fires a gun, triggering a stampede which results in many fatalities, and escapes with Vidya. But the man who did not fear death now fears for Vidya's life. He decides to quit the underworld and reveals his decision to Mhatre, who decides to send them to Dubai where they would be safe. Jhawle holds a party to celebrate his victory and invites Mhatre, Mule and Kallu to attend the same. During the party, he shoots Mhatre dead for having disobeyed his order and sends Kallu along with Mule to kill Satya. Satya, unaware of Mhatre's death, runs off to Vidya to try to clear things up, but has to flee when the police arrive. Khandilkar spills the beans in front of Vidya. Kallu returns to his headquarters, kills Mule instead of Satya, and informs Satya about Mhatre's fate. Satya takes his revenge by murdering Jhawle during Anant Chaturdashi celebrations, but suffers a bullet wound in the process. Kallu has arranged for himself and Satya to escape in a ship to Dubai. However, Satya insists that he needs to meet Vidya one last time before leaving. Satya returns to Vidya's house to meet her but she refuses to open the door. He manages to break it open but Khandilkar, who had arrived to arrest him, shoots him down, having already shot and killed Kallu Mama. Satya collapses a few inches away from Vidya's feet and breathes his last. \"It ... struck me that you always hear about these gangsters only when they either kill or when they die. But what do they do in between? That was the first thought which eventually resulted in Satya.\" Varma's views on the underworld do not conform to those depicted in mainstream films. According to him, unlike their portrayal in films like Deewar and his own Shiva \"as men who rebel against injustice,\" gangsters are anything but. Instead, they are people with a violent streak. \"I read a book called The Criminal History of Mankind where the author describes a criminal as child who refused to grow up. He doesn't abide by the laws of society. If he has physical strength, he uses it, if he doesn't, he becomes cynical and blames society all the time,\" Varma said in an interview to the Indian Express (1998). So in Satya he decided to treat killing as another nine-to-five business, with the gangster having a family and children. He too would have his fears, would feel pain, would be just as human as anyone else. In late 2006, Anurag Kashyap, script writer of the film, wrote two posts on his blog that gave an incomplete behind-the-scenes account of the idea behind and making of Satya. Every character in Satya was based on someone Varma had met or heard about; some belonged to the underworld, others didn't. \"Everyone had a reference point.\" And the plot itself had multiple influences. One of them was a criminal Varma met in a court. The man was charged with multiple murders, but had found the time to fall in love with a lawyer when he was attending proceedings. The man told Varma how he committed his first murder. At the end of his encounter, Varma held on to three things: \"it took him half an hour to brace himself before the killing, he had high fever for three days after he gunned down his first victim. And the fact that he is in love with somebody.\" These elements found their way into the film. In the film, Vidya does not know until the very end that Satya is a gangster. This aspect was inspired by the story of a man who used to live in the same building as one of Varma's friends. The man and the friend would sometimes bump into each other in the lift and exchange pleasantries. Later Varma came to know that the man had been arrested for a murder he had committed somewhere in Karnataka, and had been an absconder all this time. \"[T]he thing about Bombay is that you may live for ten years as neighbor to somebody yet have no idea who he is,\" his friend had told him. The character of Bhiku Mhatre (named, according to Kashyap, after someone who served coffee) was conceived as \"an anti-social element [who] lives by his own rules and [who] would not abide by the social rules and systems,\" a law unto himself. Even his questions would sound like statements because his \"pride wouldn't allow him to make anyone feel that he doesn't know about something.\" The scene where Bhiku grieves over Chander's death by abusing him is based on a real-life incident Varma heard of. \"A gangster lives on power\" and Chander gets himself killed by not listening to Bhiku, thus taking away Bhiku's power to save him. \"Grief [coming] out as anger. I took that as the soul [of] Bheeku Matre's character.\" \"The way he sits on a chair, the way he laughs, his general behavior\u2026 there will be a certain wildness about it. There is a difference in the look between the domestic cat and a wild cat; the eyes just give it away. Bheeku Matre should be like a wild cat.\" Kallu Mama's character was based on an ex-gangster Varma met in a bar and whose behavior made him feel uneasy. But that feeling was absent the next time Varma met this person; he was very friendly. It was then that Varma realized that the man had created a false persona the first time around and \"[had been] trying to play up to an image which he thought I had of him because he knew that I knew who he was.\" Kallu behaves in a similar manner in the film. He puts on a gangster act when a builder comes to see him temporarily hiding the fact that \"he is a clown in the gang.\" Chander's character was based on a man who \"supposedly belong[ed] to Arun Gawli\u2019s gang.\" Varma had heard a lot about him but found out, on actually meeting him, that he was very sweet-natured and used Gawli's name in every sentence\u2014\"Gawli did this, Gawli did that, Gawli bought me a house.\" His world revolved around Gawli, and he didn't have an identity of his own. But it was Satya's character (who owes his name to a woman Varma knew in his college days) that troubled Varma the most as he was \"unclear\" about Satya's nature. Was he someone who had a\"criminal streak in his head\" or was he a normal person who turned to crime? This lack of clarity persisted even after the shooting had been wrapped up and contributed to the inconsistent behviour of the character. \"Satya slashes someone in cold blood in one scene and in another scene shyly smiles at Bhiku Mhatre after killing Jaggu and when Bhiku Mhatre is having a fight with his wife, like a zombie Satya stares at them. Why did he do that?\" Varma asks and answers that he did those things because \"I told him 'do it'.\" This was the reason the character was overshadowed by the others. Satya was shot on a limited budget with a cast of newcomers and relative unknowns. The absence of \"stars\" meant that they were available whenever Varma needed them. J.D Chakravarthy had already worked with Varma on Shiva, playing the role of J.D. in the film. When Varma approached him for the eponymous role in Satya, he was a bit reticent because he was working on another project. But then Varma told him that the film would be complete in two months (it took eighteen), and so Chakravarthy agreed. Manoj Bajpai had played a cameo in Varma's previous film, Daud and Varma, who had been floored by his intensity in a particular shot, told him that there was \"something interesting in [his] face.\" He decided then and there that Manoj Bajpai would play a part in his next film that was based on the underworld. And Bajpai became Bhiku Mhatre. Urmila Matondkar was the only member of the cast who was well known thanks to Rangeela. But she was not the first choice for Vidya's role. Varma had approached Mahima Chaudhry for the part but, according to Rediff.com, she declined it when she heard that the film was about the underworld and hence Varma turned to Urmila. The Indian Express suggests, however, that Urmila replacing Mahima was a result of Varma's need for an established face, especially after Daud bombed at the box office. Shefali Shah had worked with Varma on Rangeela. But within two days, she had realized that hers was a bit part, and so she had walked out of the film. When Varma came back to her for Satya, she initially refused. But Varma apologized and even cut out a love scene from the film which Shefali had objections to. Finally, under pressure from both her husband as well as Bajpai, she agreed to play Pyaari Mhatre. Saurabh Shukla had a double deal with Varma. He was originally brought in to assist Anurag Kashyap with the script and dialogues. But he managed to bag the part of Kallu Mama in the film. Varma had first noticed Makrand Deshpande in Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak and had been planning to work with him for a long time. Varma cast him in a film which was later shelved. So when Varma began Satya, he called on Deshpande to play the part of the unscrupulous lawyer Chandrakant Mule. Character actor Govind Namdeo played the part of the corrupt and ruthless gangster-turned-politician Bhau Thakurdas Jhawle while Paresh Rawal became Amodh Shukla, the Police Commissioner who adopted the mafia's own tactics of intimidation and cold blooded murder against them, to good effect, and paid a heavy price for the same. Aditya Shrivastava played the role of Shukla's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Inspector Khandilkar who executed Shukla's ideas on the ground, and later avenged his murder by killing Satya. He also provides the voice over at various points in the film, including the beginning. Snehal Dabi played the part of Chander Krishnakant Khote, the oafish gangster wannabe who had never killed another man but bragged about having killed two, who was shot dead in an encounter by the police. Shabbir Masani was Yedaa, the only member of Mhatre gang who survives in the end. Other minor characters included those of music director Ronu Sagar (Neeraj Vora), Jagga's henchman Pakya (Sushant Singh), and Bhiku Mhatre's hitmen Vitthal Manjrekar (Sanjay Mishra) and Bappu (Rajesh Joshi). Varma had hired Kashyap to write the script but did not trust him with the dialogues; he wanted someone more mature (Kashyap was twenty three) to work on them. So he went to noted playwright Vijay Tendulkar, the man who had penned the script and dialogues for the cult classic Ardh Satya. But Tendulkar was unwell, and hence Saurabh Shukla, who also got to play Kallu Mama in the film, got the job. Kashyap and Shukla went to Varma's farmhouse in Hyderabad where they spent the next few days writing what \"looked and sounded like a script,\" before returning to Mumbai. The shooting began in Mumbai sometime in August 1997. On the third day the unit was shooting the scene where the character played by Sushant Singh, Pakya, demands a hafta from Satya. Varma had decided to cut the scene at the moment Satya slashes Pakya's cheek with his own knife. But Sushant improvised and screamed before Varma could yell \"cut.\" Kashyap recalls Varma saying \"now i know what my film is all about\" before trashing their script. This incident, the improvisation, was responsible for the realistic performances of the characters in the film. Varma gave them the leeway and controlled the performances in the editing. Sushant's scream influenced the \"style\" of Satya. But then music tycoon Gulshan Kumar was assassinated (12 August) and the changed circumstances required that a new script be written. Varma's original idea had an ending from a James Hadley Chase novel. In the final version of the film, \"that ending remained..Howard Roark didn\u2019t\". While Varma was shooting for the film, his previous film Daud was released (22 August) which was a box office disaster. That forced him to make some changes to Satya. He added some songs to the film and replaced Mahima Chaudhry with a more \"established\" Urmila Matondkar. Everything else, however, remained the same. The Ganpati immersion procession sequence and Bhau's murder sequence that form an important part of the film's climax were shot separately. On Anant Chaturdashi, a camera crew visited Chowpatty and recorded the procession. A particular wide shot where the camera zoomed into a Ganesha idol was recreated much later at Juhu beach with 500 junior artistes. The film was edited to \"create an illusion as if there were thousands,\" a trick Varma had previously used in Gaayam. The realistic scene in the beginning of the film where Manjrekar and Bappu murder a film producer on a busy street in pouring rain was shot on a set. The entire street had been created inside the studio and the vehicles parked on the side of the street belonged to the film crew. Gerard Hooper, who teaches cinematography at Drexel University, Philadelphia was the man behind the camera, and he was recommended to Varma by Kanan Ayar, the script writer for Daud. Mazhar Kamran later took over the job because Hooper could not allocate more than 40 days for the film. The film's cinematography and use of locations played a major role in its success. Unlike most Hindi films, much of Satya was shot outdoors. Hooper would roam around Mumbai filming the city even when no shoot was scheduled. \"The rawness of Satya\u2019s locales were stunning. Just see the difference an outsider gave to the film, as opposed to an Indian who takes Mumbai for granted and prefers to shoot on some set in Film City,\" Kashyap has noted. Varma gave a free hand to his cinematographers, according to Kamran, who could therefore allow the camera to move freely rather than shooting from fixed angles. This added a touch of realism to the film. \"The harsh, rough and true-to-life quality of the cinematography contributed immensely to the credibility in the film\u2019s story and played a crucial role in its commercial and critical success,\" states Kamran. Costumes Satya was primarily targeted at an urban audience and the countrywide release of the film, on 3 July 1998, was done on a commission basis to ensure that distributors didn't lose money on their investment. Telugu and Tamil language (dubbed) versions were released in the respective regional markets. It was later dubbed into English for screenings at international film festivals; Vivek Oberoi dubbed for one of the characters. Varma had expected that the Indian censor board would \"rip the film apart\" due to the \"excessive violence and liberal use of expletives\" in the film. But he was \"pleasantly surprised\" when the board passed it without any cuts though with an A rating. While this did not have any effect on the film's theatrical release, it created a small problem when Star Plus acquired the satellite telecast rights in 1998 by paying 13.5\u00a0million rupees. The movie was set to be telecast at 9:30 pm IST on a Saturday night (26 December), but had to be pushed back to 11:30 pm IST because, according to Indian laws in effect at the time, films having an A rating could not be telecast prior to 11:00 pm IST.  The film did \"record-breaking\" business in Mumbai with first-week collections of 85 percent, for a total of INR 40-50\u00a0million; it netted another INR 8-9\u00a0million in Delhi, and set new box office records in Andhra Pradesh. Satya collected 2.4\u00a0million nett from 15 screens in week one in Delhi/UP,and was a huge hit in Delhi/UP. It also benefited from the entertainment tax exemption granted by the Maharashtra government. Satya grossed \u20b9155 million (US$2.4\u00a0million) and became the 10th highest grossing Indian film of 1998. Manoj Bajpai's performance as Bhiku Mhatre enjoyed universal acclaim and turned him into a star overnight. \"It's overwhelming and also quite scary, because with a response like this, the audience also tells you that you can't afford to make mistakes,\" he said during a party held to celebrate the film's 100-day run. Aditya Srivastava, who played khandilkar, was offered his claim to fame the role of Sr. Inspector Abhijeet from TV series CID after the producer BP Singh saw him in Satya. Satya opened to positive reviews from film critics. \"It's an old-fashioned morality tale that, for a change, goes beyond the 'Bang Bang, you're dead' genre of local gangster movies. On the contrary, Satya is far more sophisticated and credible precisely because it attempts to penetrate and analyse the 'Whys' of criminality with a touch that's assured and insightful. It's far too intelligent and intense a film to break records at the box office\u2014which is a pity. It deserves to do just that,\" Shobha De wrote for the Sunday MiD DAY. \"Mumbai has never looked as sinister\u2014nor as seductive. Take a bow, Varma,\" she said. \"REJOICE. India's answer to Quentin Tarantino is here. Indeed, someone has finally had the guts to go ahead and make a movie about and for our times. No diabetic sweetness, no pretentious pontificating, no foolish fantasy out here. Believe it or not, Ram Gopal Varma belts it out straight, like a prize-boxer delivering a knockout punch,\" Khalid Mohammed wrote for Filmfare and concluded that \"Satya is a gritty, hellishly exciting film which stings and screams. No one will go away from it unprovoked or unmoved.\" It is one of the very few films to get a full 5-star rating from Mohammed. \"Picture the streets of Mumbai. Where the fine line between life and death gets more and more blurred with each passing day. The killing fields where gang wars, encounters, extortion and murder are a way of life. Where crime is just another nine-to-five job. Where criminals and cops fight for survival and supremacy, night and day\u2014only there are no winners in this game. This is Satya, a stark, chilling, almost suffocating tale of Mumbai as it is\u2014no frills, no gloss and absolutely not a moment's relief,\" wrote Deepa Deosthalee of the Indian Express. She also praised Chowta's background score and Hooper and Kamran's \"stark cinematography\" while concluding that Satya was \"an unforgettable experience\". \"I will remember 'Satya' as long as truth lives. I will remember 'Satya' as a film that threatened to tear my soul apart, trample my conscience. It is one film which will certainly shake up every young man about to take the first step into a dark and destructive land called nowhere. Ramu has done more than any modern social reformer has done. Generations to come will be grateful to him for having the guts to tell the truth as it is, the truth about the truth,\" Ali Peter John wrote for Screen Weekly. Some critics thought that through Satya Varma was glorifying crime, violence and the underworld, causing him to add a cautionary message to the end credits of the film: This film is an attempt on my part to reach out to all those people who took to violence as a means for their living. At the end of it, even if one of them out there looks into himself before he takes out his gun the next time, and understands that the pain he inflicts on others is exactly the same as he would suffer himself, I would consider this effort worthwhile. My tears for Satya are as much as they are for the people whom he killed. Varma has, on his part, clarified time and again that his films do not glorify crime. \"I'm not glorifying the underworld. I want to portray stark reality, as Shekhar Kapur did in Bandit Queen. I want to show the human side of the underworld, why a man picks up the gun,\" he said in an interview to Rediff.com even as the film was on the floors. \"Everybody who took the gun died a miserable death at the end of the day in the film. So when people accuse me of glorifying violence, this is my answer,\" he reiterated in a 2004 interview to the BBC. According to Indologist Professor Philip Lutgendorf, Satya has too many parallels with Raj Kapoor's Shri 420 for them to be mere coincidence. Satya won several National and International accolades. Ram Gopal Varma received the Bimal Roy memorial trophy for best direction. Satya won six Filmfare Awards, including all three Critics awards (Best Movie, Best Actor and Best Actress awards, male and female, for Bajpai and Shah), Best Editing (Apurva Asrani and Bhanodaya), Best Sound Recording (H. Sridhar) and Best Background Score (Sandeep Chowta). It won four Star Screen Awards including Best Supporting Actor (Bajpai), Best Supporting Actress (Shah), Best Screenplay (Shukla) and Screen Award Special Jury Award (J. D. Chakravarthy). Ram Gopal Varma won the Bollywood Movie Award \u2013 Best Director for this film. Bajpai also bagged the Zee Cine Award and the National Film Award for best actor in a supporting role.In 2005, Indiatimes Movies included Satya in its list of 25 Must See Bollywood Movies.

British director Danny Boyle has cited Satya as an inspiration for his 2008 Academy Award winning film Slumdog Millionaire. Satya's \"slick, often mesmerizing\" portrayal of the Mumbai underworld, which included gritty and realistic \"brutality and urban violence,\" directly influenced the portrayal of the Mumbai underworld in Slumdog Millionaire. The soundtrack of the film features music composed by Vishal Bhardwaj and lyrics written by Gulzar. Sandeep Chowta created the background score for the film, as in most other Varma films. Satya was the second hit soundtrack produced by the Gulzar-Bhardwaj collaboration, the previous one being Maachis. Planet Bollywood, giving it a 9.0 rating, said that while the music sounded and felt like that of Maachis it was \"almost as good.\" The Music Magazine called Bhardwaj's score for Satya \"a trifle short of outstanding\". But it was Chowta's haunting background score that created waves and overshadowed the original score. The Hindu, commenting on the dying art of film scoring, mentioned Satya when it noted \"interestingly (and hopefully) Indian films are just making a start with original soundtracks: Sandeep Chowta's background score for Ram Gopal Varma's 'Satya'\". And when Rediff.com announced that the background score had arrived in Hindi cinema, it said Satya had \"set the standards for background score\" and that the film's throbbing score \"took the audience inside the mind of its characters. Every time a bullet was shot or there were close-ups of actors, one could hear the haunting score, which had a hallucinatory effect on the audience.\" In an interview to Screen Weekly, Sandeep Chowta had this to say about background scores: When asked why his score overshadowed the film's music, Chowta said that in spite of Bhardwaj's songs being \"nice\", they did not fit into the film. In November 1998, the background score of the film was released as a separate album, Satya: The Sound. Satya gained three sequels, Company (2002), D (2005) and Satya 2 (2013).",

        "full_text": " Satyam Shivam Sundaram (English: The Truth, The Good and The Beauty) is a 1978 Bollywood film starring Shashi Kapoor and Zeenat Aman, directed by Raj Kapoor and written by Jainendra Jain. It is a social drama about the differences between physical and spiritual love.   The story is set in a village where Roopa (Zeenat Aman) lives with her father, the village priest. As a young child, the right side of Roopa's face & neck were burned by a pot of boiling oil, leaving part of her face disfigured. Henceforth, Roopa keeps her right cheek hidden under the cover of her Sari. Despite the terrible accident, Roopa remains religious and goes to the village temple daily, singing hymns and devotional songs. The protagonist Rajeev (Shashi Kapoor) is a dashing engineer who arrives in the village to oversee the operation of a major dam. He abhors anything that is ugly. He hears Roopa's religious singing and meets her, but somehow doesn't pay attention to her disfigured side, and falls in love with her. He then asks her father permission to marry her. After the wedding, he discovers the truth, and thinks that he was cheated and forced to marry someone else, at which point he disowns Roopa and drives her out of the house. Roopa decides to meet him at night, using a veil to hide the charred side of her face. Rajeev spends his days hating his wife, and his nights loving his mistress, not knowing they are both the same woman - Roopa. During one of their nights together, they make love and Roopa gets pregnant. When Rajeev finds out that his wife is pregnant, he suspects her of infidelity and still refuses to believe this his \"mistress\" and wife are one and the same. In the movie's climax, a terrible storm ravages the village, breaking open the dam which Rajeev had come to build. In the swirling waters of the flood, Rajeev realises how shallow he had been, and saves Roopa from drowning. Laxmikant-Pyarelal's music won the Filmfare Best Music Director Award. Lata Mangeshkar lends her voice to the main theme song \"Satyam Shivam Sundaram\", which was among the chart-toppers of the year, and still remains a chartbuster. Various recent music groups from both India and the United States, such as Thievery Corporation and Sheila Chandra, have re-done the theme song from the movie. Also, many variations of the song have been made (e.g. the original version is considered, in Indian music, a Bhajan, but Lata Mangeshkar has also made a bhangra-like version, a different style). Mangeshkar at the time of recording the main theme song was in dispute regards royalties with Raj Kapoor. She has conveyed that she came for the recording, practiced the song for a short while, sang the song in anger in one take and left. Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood gave 9 stars stating, \"Satyam Shivam Sundaram is still a soundtrack that shines more amidst L-P\u2019s many melody accomplishments.\" \"I visualised the story of a man falling for a woman with an ordinary countenance but a golden voice and wanted to cast Lata Mangeshkar in the role, the book quotes Raj Kapoor as saying.\"",

The movie starts with Mandhari, an old crippled man, telling a story of two friends to some kids. In the story, Rajeshwar Singh, a landlord's son, and Veer Singh, a poor boy, become friends. They are naughty kids, calling each other as Raju and Veeru respectively. As the duo grow up, Raju decides to get his sisters marriage arranged with Veeru. Neither his sister nor Veeru have any objections to the marriage. However, as luck would have it, a girls marriage is disrupted due to her in laws demanding dowry. Veeru steps in to save the face of the girl and her parents by marrying her. While Raju is shocked by this development, his sister, who had a secret crush on Veeru, commits suicide. A devastated and distraught Raju now declares that Veeru is solely responsible for whatever happened and that the latter is now his mortal enemy. With these new developments, the duo have their territories marked. They come to an uneasy and unwritten truce: no one will kill a living soul from the others territory, but anybody entering other persons territory will be doing this at his own peril. Chuniya, a kin of Raja, sees an opportunity to leech off the money of Rajeshwar by keeping the two sides at war. Chuniya has Veer's son Vishal killed, making the latter believe that Rajeshwar will stop at nothing to eliminate Veer. Over the years, the tension escalates. The clashes between the former friends become a headache for the Commissioner. Mandhari, who is now revealed to be a beggar and part of the story, happens to be one of the lucky few who do not have any fear of death from either side. Mandhari claims to the Commissioner that the day he finds out a solution to the problem, he will dance on one leg. Here, Rajeshwar's granddaughter Radha and Veer's grandson Vasu meet each other. Radha and Vasu are unaware of the enmity and fall in love. When Mandhari finds about this, he happily completes his pledge to himself and reveals the truth to the lovers.

Radha and Vasu's pleas fall on deaf ears. However, Chuniya's luck doesn't last long. The people with whom Chuniya had dealt attack Rajeshwar, exposing Chuniya's real face. A distraught Rajeshwar and a sympathetic Veer finally sort out their enmity of decades. Here, Chuniya grows desperate as has Radha and Vasu captured. The people from both sides unite to fight against Chuniya. Soon, Radha and Vasu are saved, but they are unaware of the fact that their grandfathers have reconciled. Raju and Veeru kill Chuniya, but get fatally wounded themselves. As the friends die in each other's arms, the final chapter on this friendship and enmity is closed. The story cuts to present, revealing that Radha and Vasu got married and they formed a trust in the name of their grandparents, which is taking the care of education of the children Mandhari is retelling the story to. Radha and Vasu inaugurate the school as Aarti looks on. The music for the film was composed by the legendary duo of Laxmikant-Pyarelal, and the lyrics were written by Anand Bakshi.",

        "full_text": " Seeta aur Geeta (translation: Seeta and Geeta) is a 1972 Indian Hindi-language comedy-drama film directed by Ramesh Sippy. The story is by Salim-Javed and the music by R.D. Burman. The story is about identical twins (played by Hema Malini) who are separated at birth and grow up with different temperaments. The twins then swap places (like The Prince and the Pauper). Hema's two partners in the movie are played by Dharmendra and Sanjeev Kumar. Manorama plays the evil aunt who changes her tune after her arm is twisted (literally). Furthermore, Hema Malini was noted for the novelty of her role as Geeta where she is rambunctious and sometimes violent. This theme has been repeated in other movies before and after. A prior movie on this theme was Ram Aur Shyam starring Dilip Kumar in the leading dual role. Subsequent Hindi remakes of the story have been made, including Jaise Ko Taisa starring Jeetendra, ChaalBaaz starring Sridevi, Kishen Kanhaiya starring Anil Kapoor, Judwaa starring Salman Khan, Duplicate starring Shahrukh Khan, Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi starring Kajol, in the dual roles. Remakes in other languages include the Telugu film Ganga Manga (1973) and the Tamil film Vani Rani (1974), both starring Vanisri in the dual roles. Hema Malini won her only competitive Filmfare Best Actress Award of her career. P. Vaikunth won the Filmfare Best Cinematographer Award. In 1976, the film was shown in Soviet Union where it was a success.   Seeta and Geeta (Hema Malini in a dual role) are twin girls who were separated at birth. Geeta, a feisty girl is raised in a poor neighborhood and is a street performer, while Seeta is raised by her cruel aunt Chachi and meek uncle. Chachi treats Seeta like a servant, despite the fact that the family is living off her late parents' money. Seeta's only consolation is her old grandmother. One day, Seeta decides life is not worth living and runs away to commit suicide. She is saved but is mistaken for her identical twin Geeta and is taken to Geeta's home. Meanwhile, Seeta's aunt and uncle are frantically searching for her and find Geeta. They attempt to force Geeta to go with them but, using some of her clever tricks, she escapes them and the police who have been searching for her. She then meets Ravi (Sanjeev Kumar) and, though he also mistakes her for Seeta, she goes home with him. Ravi is surprised by this \"Seeta\" and the Seeta he had met previously. Geeta realizes the cruelty that Seeta has been living under and vows to teach her aunt a lesson. Meanwhile, the real Seeta is living in Geeta's house. Her surrogate mother has attributed her new docile attitude to shock. Here, Seeta meets Raka (Dharmendra), Geeta's friend and fellow performer. Raka is also surprised by \"Geeta's\" sudden gentle nature and desire to do housework. When he tried to coax her into performing, she is unable to do so. Ravi meanwhile falls in love with Geeta. At home, Geeta begins to set everything on a proper course. She resumes control of the money and restores her grandmother to the head of the household, where she belongs. Raka begins to fall in love with Seeta. Trouble begins brewing when Chachi's brother Ranjeet comes to visit and sees the real Seeta in a marketplace. He follows her and discovers the truth, which leads to a showdown in the villains' den and then marriage. All the songs were composed by Rahul Dev Burman and lyrics were penned by Anand Bakshi.",

        "full_text": " Shaan (\"Pride\") is a 1980 Indian Hindi-language action-thriller film. The film was directed by Ramesh Sippy after the super success of his previous venture, Sholay. The story was written by Salim-Javed. The film was expected to match the success of Sholay but failed to do so.[citation needed] The film however, ran to packed houses in its re-runs and made a lot of money. Eventually, it was declared to be the highest grosser of 1980 by IBOS. It did obtain the services of Sholay's music composer, R.D. Burman, whose songs for the film provided it with a Best Music nomination at Filmfare, this being its sole nomination.   Logistical issues relating to other projects in which the cast were involved meant that Shaan took three years to make. While Sholay drew its inspiration from the American Western and spaghetti western films, Shaan took its lead from the James Bond films with fancy sets and beautiful costumes. Shakaal, the bald villain played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda, was based on the James Bond villain, Blofeld. A large golden eagle is prominent in Shakaal's island lair and in the Bollywood obligatory final song-and-dance. The eagle is reminiscent of the golden lamb in Cecile DeMille's Ten Commandments; construction on the golden eagle required outside experts to be flown in and cost, in Rupees, the equivalent of the chariot scene in Ben-Hur. Sippy wanted to repeat the cast of Sholay for this film but due to date issues, Sunil dutt played the role initially offered to Sanjeev Kumar, Bindiya goswami played the role initially offered to Hema Malini, and Shashi Kapoor was roped in when Dharmendra declined to do the character of Ravi. The film was set and partially filmed on the island of Steep Holm. DCP (Deputy Commissioner of Police) Shiv Kumar (Sunil Dutt), returns home to his wife Sheetal (Rakhee Gulzar) and their young daughter and announces that he has been transferred to Bombay. He has two brothers, Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) and Ravi (Shashi Kapoor), who live in Bombay. They are intelligent, capable guys but spend their time loafing about the city and swindling unsuspecting people. A mysterious man (Shatrughan Sinha) tries to assassinate Shiv Kumar twice in the city. Shiv survives both the times. After being swindled by Chacha (Johnny Walker) and Renu (Bindiya Goswami), the twosome decide to join forces with them. They are quickly joined by a glamorous thief Sunita (Parveen Babi). One of their tricks eventually backfires and lands Vijay and Ravi in jail. Shiv bails them out and reads them the riot act at home. After the two attempts on his life, Vijay and Ravi advise him to find a different line of work, arguing that his profession is unpredictable, dangerous and unsuitable for a family man. Shiv stands firm, citing his undying patriotic commitment to his corps and his country. Shakaal (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) is an international crime lord operating from a remote island outside India. Shakaal is a sadistic villain who rejoices in pain of his enemies and traitors. Shiv gets progressively closer to the root of the crimes in the city. Shakaal has Shiv brought before him. He compliments Shiv on his wits and valour, and offers him to come to the his side. True to his form, Shiv firmly refuses the offer. Shakaal tries to kill him, but Shiv breaks loose and tries to escape from the island. Shakaal unleashes wild dogs upon Shiv and eventually shoots him dead on the beach from a helicopter. As Vijay, Ravi and Sheetal lament their tragic loss, the mysterious man who tried to kill Shiv shows up. Sheetal angrily identifies him. The man introduces himself as Rakesh, a marksman and former circus performer who used to shoot targets blindfolded. He was recruited by Shakaal to assassinate Shiv, by holding Rakesh's wife hostage. Rakesh confesses that he deliberately missed Shiv on the two previous instances, hoping it would buy him time to rescue his wife. On realizing this, an angry Shakaal killed his wife. Rakesh sought out Ravi and Vijay so they could work together to bring down Shakaal. The trio seek the aid of a homeless cripple, Abdul (Mazhar Khan) and manage to find and destroy Shakaal's contraband warehouse in the city. Finding that Abdul was providing Ravi and Vijay with information, Shakaal has his men kill him. Enraged with the destruction of his warehouses, Shakaal kidnaps Sheetal and has her brought to his island. Vijay, Ravi and Rakesh fume, knowing that Sheetal will almost certainly be killed and that they have no clue about the location of Shakaal's island. At this point, Jagmohan (Mac Mohan), another of Shakaal's aides who has been mercilessly crippled by him, offers his help to the group to gain entry to Shakaal's hideout. Posing as a musical troupe (a familiar stratagem in many Bollywood films), Vijay and Ravi (with Renu, Chacha and Sunita) enter the island and perform for Shakaal. Shakaal, however, reveals that Jagmohan was sent by him to trap them. Jagmohan's fracture was a lie. Their cover is blown and they are captured. An elaborate sequence ensues as the three men escape. The trio and the widow avoid the booby traps and henchmen, ultimately capture Shakaal and finally end his ignominious existence. Shakaal, with his dying breath, sets his island hideout to blow up but the heroes escape via helicopter to safety.",

The film was produced and directed by Tinnu Anand. The story of the film was written by Amitabh Bachchan's wife Jaya Bachchan and the screenplay was written by veteran screenwriter Inder Raj Anand who died before the film was released. The film marked Bachchan's comeback after a three-year hiatus during which he had entered politics. The film became a blockbuster upon its release. This film was based on an old 'B' grade Indian stunt film 'Shabnam' starring Mehmood, L.Vijaylakshmi and Jeevan. The film is also similar to that of the 1982 film 'Shakti'; the two opposing enemies are Vijay and J.K., played by Amitabh Bachchan and Amrish Puri.   The movie opens with a corrupt and sniveling bank manager Mathur (Prem Chopra) and crime baron J.K. Verma (Amrish Puri). Mathur is in a financial dilemma as he has illegally loaned J.K. 2.5 million rupees, and J.K. orchestrates a bank robbery to bail him out. Inspector Anand Shrivastav (Kader Khan) gets wind of this plot. He arrests a key henchman of J.K., and is about to crack the case when J.K. enlists an exotic dancer, Julie (Aruna Irani), to use the robbery as a backdrop and frame the honest inspector for corruption. Inspector Shrivastav is arrested and is imprisoned for three months. Inspector Shrivastav, the honest and innocent inspector, is so depressed about the false charges that he hangs himself at home after being released on bail. This creates a lasting and powerful impression on his young eight-year-old son, Vijaykumar (Amitabh Bachchan), simply known as 'Vijay', who firmly believes in his father's hard work, innocence, and dedication, for years. Every day, he thinks about his father's uncalled for decision. Vijay retains the noose his father used to hang himself. He would someday restore his father's honour. Vijay and his mother leave their house and live in the house of another police inspector named Aslam Khan, who would take care of them as Vijay grows up. As Vijay grows, his determination to avenge his father grows too. 20 years later, a young Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) in the inspector uniform, grows up in the care of Inspector Aslam Khan (Pran), Inspector Shrivastav's friend and partner, who has allowed Vijay and his mother to live with him, and Vijay becomes a cop himself. Vijay is friends with Shaheena, the daughter of Aslam Khan. Aslam Khan is an honest cop much like Vijay's father. Vijay is an obsequious and cowardly inspector, prone to bribery and generally scared of powerful criminals. It doesn't take JK long to find Vijay, get him on payroll, and run his underworld crime empire (drugs, guns, racketeering) past the cops. A new apparition bursts upon this scene who calls himself \"Shahenshah\", a costumed crime fighter (see movie poster). He has a left iron hand which is used to attack enemies and smash objects, and Shahenshah's other weapon is a noose. Oddly enough, it is the same noose Vijay's father used to hang himself with. This is because it is revealed a bit later that Shahenshah is actually Vijay. When wearing Shahenshah's attire, Vijay describes himself as \"one who doesn't hold a cop's job but does the same work; one who apprehends criminals himself, conducts the trials himself, and, pronounces and executes the sentences himself\". A bit later, the mysterious Shahenshah reveals to the public that he is none othFrustrated and helpless at the corruption in the police force, Vijay has employed this new tack to get to the criminals. Vijay/Shahenshah's outward mission is to take out crime, but his real goal is to get to the guys who framed his father. Shahenshah quietly breaks up several of J.K.'s gambling dens and illicit liquor distilleries. He also halts the demolition of a slum. This catches the eye of small-time trickster Shalu (Meenakshi Seshadri) who lives there with her aging and ailing mother Julie. J.K. had ordered her assassination after she helped frame Vijay's father; she has been on the run from him ever since; this becomes Shalu's motivation for seeking out and eliminating J.K. Shalu decides to infiltrate J.K.'s coterie by becoming an exotic dancer. One night, she attempts to kill J.K. by shooting him but is shocked when J.K. reveals he had been wearing a bullet-proof vest the whole time. Vijay lies to J.K. that Shahenshah's weakness is not letting Shalu die. He also lies that if J.K. returns Shalu to Shahenshah, Shahenshah will return J. K.'s goods worth millions. But J.K. is ultimately fooled. Shahenshah later detonates a bomb planted in J.K.'s truck. Julie later reveals that she was on Inspector Shrivastav's side all along and was pretending to be on J.K.'s side the whole time; her supposedly helping J.K. frame Inspector Shrivastav was all just a part of her plan to help the police arrest J.K The fun begins when J.K. murders an honest crime reporter Mohammed Salim (Vijayendra Ghatge), who was about to expose JK's crime ring. Salim was married to Shaheena (Supriya Pathak), the daughter of Aslam Khan, and was also Vijay's brother-in-law. Vijay now decides to turn around his image as a cowardly cop. He openly defies J.K. Julie agrees to testify against J.K. Shalu provides ancillary evidence. And J.K. prepares for an all out war against Shahenshah/Vijay, Shalu and the lot of his enemies. At Salim's funeral, only one of the many witnesses of his death were present. He was about to reveal J.K.'s name, but a sharpshooter named Rana Pratap Singh shot him to death. There is a veritable bloodbath on the streets as Inspector Vijay tries to get Julie into the courthouse. And there is a final showdown where Shahenshah reveals his secret identity and becomes the nemesis for all the culprits. To give himself a chance to escape, J.K. abducts Shalu. The showdown leads Vijay, dressed in Shahenshah's attire, chasing J.K. to the roof of the courthouse where J.K. is pleading his case, because his cover is blown. J.K. falls through a hole in the roof and is clinging on for dear life, with the whole court, judge sahab, audience and all looks on in astonishment. Vijay throws the noose down to J.K., and he gratefully accepts it. J.K., being the ruthless man that he is, attempts to attack Vijay. Vijay lets go of the noose, which slips around J.K.'s neck, and before the whole court, J.K. Verma is hanged, avenging Inspector Shrivastav and Salim the reporter, Shaheena's husband. Now with the biggest crime lord removed from his way, Vijay becomes the most successful officer in India after his father. Tinnu Anand who had made the very successful film Kaalia with Amitabh, wanted to make another movie with him during the early 1980s. The story of Shahenshah was written by Amitabh's wife, Jaya Bachchan and further refined by Tinnu Anand's father Inder Raj Anand. Even though Anand signed up Bachchan in 1983, the film could not commence shooting because only three days before shooting was to begin in Bangalore, Amitabh fell seriously ill. After a thorough medical examination it was revealed that he had developed myasthenia gravis, a rare chronic autoimmune disease marked by muscular weakness without atrophy. Due to Amitabh's illness and his commitments to other movies, the start of Shahenshah's shooting was delayed until 1985. By this time, the main heroine of the film, Dimple Kapadia, was replaced by Meenakshi Sheshadri. The now iconic costume that Amitabh donned in this movie weighed almost 18\u00a0kg, and despite his illness, Amitabh insisted on wearing the costume in all of his fight scenes. During shooting, Amitabh and Tinnu got into a disagreement over one particular scene in which Tinnu wanted Amitabh to wear his police uniform but Amitabh insisted on wearing a blazer instead. The argument got quite heated and with neither of the two willing to change his stance, shooting was temporarily halted. It was not until Tinnu's father, Inder Raj Anand, intervened and convinced Amitabh to wear the police uniform by explaining its significance in the scene that the shooting resumed. The shooting eventually wrapped up in October 1987. Even though the film was initially planned to be released in November, the release date kept on being pushed back due to the threat of a boycott of the movie by some opposition political parties. These parties had had some conflict with Amitabh while he was a Congress MP and they maintained bitterness towards him even after he had retired from politics. Shahenshah was finally released in February 1988 and went on to become a huge blockbuster earning over 6 crores by its fifth week. The film performed very well at the box office despite strong competition from other superhit movies like Tezaab and Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, both of which were targeted towards the newer generation.",

It was written by the famous writing duo Salim-Javed and produced by Mushir-Riaz. Shakti was notable for being the first and only film to feature veteran actors Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan together on screen. Considered to be one of the greatest films in the history of Indian cinema, it went on to win several Filmfare awards among which were Best Film and Best Actor which was awarded to Dilip Kumar.The story focuses on a police officer and his son.

His son escapes, but grows up to be a rebellious young man, who still loves his father, but does not want anything to do with his father anymore, and his main mission is to eliminate the criminals who abducted him years ago. The movie had a similar storyline as that of the 1974 Tamil movie Thanga Pathakkam which went on to be remade in Hindi in 1982 as Farz Aur Kanoon.   An ex-cop Ashwini Kumar learns that his grandson Ravi Kumar wants to follow his footsteps. Kumar thinks that his grandson is taking this decision in a flow of emotions, without taking into consideration its implications. To warn his grandson about the dangers and pitfalls of the profession, Kumar decides to tell his own story. How the grandson makes his decision that would affect his whole life is the crux of the story. Retired Commissioner of Police Ashwini Kumar (Dilip Kumar) is at the railway station to receive his teenage grandson Ravi (Anil Kapoor), who has just returned after completing his B.A. exams. On being asked by his grandfather about his future plans, Ravi promptly replies that he wants to become a police officer and serve his country, just like his grandfather. Kumar tells him that the journey of being a police officer is fraught with many arduous challenges, and Ravi should reconsider his decision. Kumar starts by explaining his own life story in a flashback. Kumar had a happy family consisting him, Sheetal, Ravi's grandmother, and son Vijay, Ravi's father. In the course of purging the city of crime, Ashwini takes up cudgels against a dreaded gangster named J.K. Verma (Amrish Puri). He arrests a key henchman of J.K. named Yashwant in order to decimate J.K.'s supremacy. However, J.K. takes matters into his own hands and abducts Vijay. J.K. calls up Ashwini and tries to strike a deal: Yashwant's freedom in lieu of Vijay's life. Ashwini a virtuous cop, tells J.K. on the phone that even if his only son is killed in the process, he will not betray the law. Unbeknownst to Ashwini, however, the conversation is being tape recorded. When Vijay listen to his father's voice on the tape recorder, he is shocked and pained to hear his father's words and his lackadaisical attitude towards his own flesh and blood. With no help forthcoming, Vijay takes it upon himself to escape his abductors. Whilst the entire gang is searching for Vijay, K.D. Narang (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), another goon in J.K.'s gang, finds Vijay but pities the helpless child and helps him escape to safety. The police trace J.K.'s hideout, but find that Vijay is missing. Vijay manages to escape and reaches home safely, but Vijay slowly and surely distances himself from his father. Narang and J.K. become sworn enemies after J.K. discovers that Narang was behind Vijay's escape. As the years pass by, Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan), who has now become a young man, begins resenting his father and his father's love for upholding the law. During a chance encounter, Vijay rescues a young lady named Roma (Smita Patil), Ravi's mother, from 4 rowdy men who try to molest her. Vijay and Roma begin to form a close relationship. During a job interview for the post of Assistant Manager of a Hotel, K.D. Narang, the owner of the Hotel, happens to be passing by. He interjects the interview and promptly hires Vijay. Vijay remembers K.D. Narang as the person who had saved his life and decides to work in whatever capacity required with the man he perceives he owes his life to. The duo, J.K. and K.D., have now become sworn enemies in their illegal businesses, so J.K. decides to remove his thorns before they suck the blood out of him and his business. J.K. tries to get K.D. murdered but Vijay rescues K.D. with his presence of mind. Vijay reminisces to K.D. how Vijay owes his life to K.D., and now Vijay becomes K.D.'s right hand man. J.K. is infuriated at his men for failing to kill Narang. His men tell him that Vijay spoiled the plan. Enraged, J.K. creates a plan to kill Vijay first, followed by Narang, and then Ashwini. Ashwini resents the growing proximity between Vijay and K.D. Narang, so he asks Vijay to leave his house. Vijay moves in with Roma, and they start living together, without marriage. Sheetal tries to persuade her son to leave the path of wrong, but in vain. Later, Roma reveals to Vijay that she is pregnant with his child, who is Ravi, so Vijay marries her. One night, while Vijay and Roma are at a restaurant, a drunk man named Ganpat Rai attempts to propose to Roma, but Vijay beats him up, causing two men dressed in blue clothes to come forward and escort Rai out of the hotel. It turns out that these two men hired Rai to act foolish and drunk. A few minutes later, one of the men stab Rai to death. The next morning Vijay returns home, but Ashwini's men follow him. Ashwini's most loyal officer, Sudhakar, possesses a warrant claiming Vijay had murdered Rai. Vijay is taken into police custody but when the charges are determined false, Vijay is released from prison and he begins to work with K.D. full-time. When Narang's truck of goods is stolen by J.K., Vijay requests Narang to bring his truck back to him, but alone, to which Narang agrees. When Vijay sees J.K. passing by, he captures him. Vijay tells J.K. that he was the same boy whom J.K. had abducted from school, and that he has been waiting for his revenge for years, much to J.K.'s horror. After a heated battle with J.K.'s men, Vijay drives Narang's truck back to him. When journalists cross-question Ashwini about his conflict of interest - his own son being a renowned gangster in K.D.'s gang, but he is the Deputy Commissioner of Police - the Commissioner of Police (Ashok Kumar) asks Ashwini to forego the case. Ashwini, however, requests for 48 hours to capture and bring Vijay and the other nefarious gangsters to justice, failing which Ashwini will resign. K.D., Vijay and most of J.K.'s gangsters are arrested, but J.K. remains absconding. J.K. takes it upon himself to eliminate his troubles once and for all by murdering Ashwini. Instead, Sheetal is murdered by J.K. himself whilst trying to shield her husband. An enraged Vijay, who is imprisoned at the time of Sheetal's murder, escapes the police and proceeds to start hunting for J.K.'s head. Vijay finds a den where four of J.K.'s men are present. Vijay tells them he has nothing against them, and only wants J.K., but the gangsters attempt to murder him. However, Vijay succeeds in killing all of the men. During the interrogation of one of J.K.'s henchmen, Vijay learns that J.K. has plans to leave India using fake credentials. Vijay then kills the man, who drowns. Following up on the tip, Vijay arrives at the airport, and ultimately succeeds in killing J.K., who is in a disguise, thereby avenging his mother's death. Ashwini succeeds in tracking down Vijay and asks Vijay not to escape, but in vain. A teary-eyed Ashwini pulls the trigger, mortally wounding his son in the process. Ashwini rushes towards him and in a tearful goodbye, Vijay realizes his mistake and asks for forgiveness, saying to his father that he always loved him very much. Vijay then dies. This makes Ashwini realize what a foolish idea it was to kill Vijay, and why he had not thought twice about doing so before pulling the trigger. Following this, he immediately quits the police force. The scene cuts to the present and a tearful Ashwini reiterates to Ravi, asking him whether he wants to follow his decision of being a police office. Ravi, despite hearing the heartbreaking story, firmly replies in the affirmative. Kumar and Roma, Ravi's mother, give Ravi their blessings. Ravi takes a train and leaves, signifying that he would become an officer in the future. Both Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan were nominated for the Best Actor award but it was Dilip Kumar who eventually won it. Amitabh Bachchan had a total of 3 nominations in the category that year. The film was critically acclaimed and won many accolades listed below: The song \"Jane Kaise Kab Kahan\" is an evergreen hit. All lyrics written by Anand Bakshi; all music composed by R.D. Burman.",

        "full_text": " Sholay (\u00a0pronunciation\u00a0(help\u00b7info), meaning \"Embers\") is a 1975 Indian Hindi-language action-adventure film, directed by Ramesh Sippy and produced by his father G. P. Sippy. The film follows two criminals, Veeru and Jai (played by Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan), hired by a retired police officer (Sanjeev Kumar) to capture the ruthless dacoit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan). Hema Malini and Jaya Bhaduri also star, as Veeru and Jai's love interests. Sholay is considered a classic and one of the best Indian films. It was ranked first in the British Film Institute's 2002 poll of \"Top 10 Indian Films\" of all time. In 2005, the judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards named it the Best Film of 50 Years. The film was shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, in the southern state of Karnataka, over a span of two and a half years. After the Central Board of Film Certification mandated the removal of several violent scenes, Sholay was released with a length of 198\u00a0minutes. In 1990, the original director's cut of 204\u00a0minutes became available on home media. When first released, Sholay received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response, but favourable word-of-mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success. It broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across India, and ran for more than five years at Mumbai's Minerva theatre. By some accounts, Sholay is the highest grossing Indian film of all time, adjusted for inflation. The film drew heavily from the conventions of Westerns, and is a defining example of the masala film, which mixes several genres in one work. Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory. The combined sales of the original soundtrack, scored by R. D. Burman, and the dialogues (released separately), set new sales records. The film's dialogues and certain characters became extremely popular, contributing to numerous cultural memes and becoming part of India's daily vernacular. In January 2014, Sholay was re-released to theatres in the 3D format.   In the small village of Ramgarh, the retired policeman Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar) summons a pair of small-time thieves that he had once arrested. Thakur feels that the duo\u2014Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jai (Amitabh Bachchan)\u2014would be ideal to help him capture Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan), a dacoit wanted by the authorities for a \u20b9 50,000[b] reward. Thakur tells them to surrender Gabbar to him, alive, for an additional \u20b9 20,000 reward. The two thieves thwart the dacoits sent by Gabbar to extort the villagers. Soon afterwards, Gabbar and his goons attack Ramgarh during the festival of Holi. In a tough battle, Veeru and Jai are cornered. Thakur, although he has a gun within his reach, does not help them. Veeru and Jai fight back and the bandits flee. The two are, however, upset at Thakur's inaction, and consider leaving the village. Thakur explains that Gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members, and cut off both his arms a few years earlier, which is why he could not use the gun. He had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a shawl. Living in Ramgarh, the jovial Veeru and cynical Jai find themselves growing fond of the villagers. Veeru is attracted to Basanti (Hema Malini), a feisty, talkative young woman who makes her living by driving a horse-cart. Jai is drawn to Radha (Jaya Bhaduri), Thakur's reclusive, widowed daughter-in-law, who subtly returns his affections. Skirmishes between Gabbar's gang and Jai-Veeru finally result in the capture of Veeru and Basanti by the dacoits. Jai attacks the gang, and the three are able to flee Gabbar's hideout with dacoits in pursuit. Fighting from behind a rock, Jai and Veeru nearly run out of ammunition. Veeru, unaware that Jai was wounded in the gunfight, is forced to leave for more ammunition. Meanwhile, Jai, who is continuing the gunfight singlehandedly, decides to sacrifice himself by using his last bullet to ignite dynamite sticks on a bridge from close range. Veeru returns, and Jai dies in his arms. Enraged, Veeru attacks Gabbar's den and catches the dacoit. Veeru nearly beats Gabbar to death when Thakur appears and reminds Veeru of the promise to hand over Gabbar alive. Thakur uses his spike-soled shoes to severely injure Gabbar and destroy his hands. The police then arrive and arrest Gabbar. After Jai's funeral, Veeru leaves Ramgarh and finds Basanti waiting for him on the train. Radha is left alone again. The idea for Sholay began as a four-line snippet which screenwriter pair Salim-Javed told G. P. Sippy and Ramesh Sippy; two other producer/director teams had earlier rejected the idea. Ramesh Sippy liked the concept and hired them to develop it. The original idea of the film involved an army officer who decided to hire two ex-soldiers to avenge the murder of his family. The army officer was later changed to a policeman because Sippy felt that it would be difficult to get permission to shoot scenes depicting army activities. Salim-Javed completed the script in one month, incorporating names and personality traits of their friends and acquaintances. The film was loosely styled after Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film Seven Samurai, and drew heavily from the conventions of Westerns, especially Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns such as Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), and John Sturges' film The Magnificent Seven (1960). Sholay was also influenced by the westerns of Sam Peckinpah, such as The Wild Bunch (1969) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973); and by George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). A scene depicting an attempted train robbery was inspired by a similar scene in North West Frontier (1959), and a scene showing the massacre of Thakur's family has been compared with the massacre of the McBain family in Once Upon a Time in the West. Some plot elements were borrowed from the Indian films Mera Gaon Mera Desh (1971) and Khote Sikkay (1973). The character Gabbar Singh was modelled on a real-life dacoit of the same name who had menaced the villages around Gwalior in the 1950s. Any policeman captured by the real Gabbar Singh had his ears and nose cut off, and was released as a warning to other policemen. The character was also influenced by the villain \"El Indio\" (played by Gian Maria Volont\u00e8) of Sergio Leone's For a Few Dollars More (1965). Soorma Bhopali, a minor comic relief character, was based on an acquaintance of actor Jagdeep, a forest officer from Bhopal named Soorma. The real-life Soorma eventually threatened to press charges when people who had viewed the film began referring to him as a woodcutter. The main characters' names, Jai and Veeru, mean \"victory\" and \"heroism\" in Hindi. The producers considered Danny Denzongpa for the role of bandit chief Gabbar Singh, but he could not accept it as he was committed to act in Feroz Khan's Dharmatma (1975), under production at the same time. Amjad Khan, who was the second choice, prepared himself for the part by reading the book Abhishapta Chambal, which told of the exploits of Chambal dacoits. The book was written by Taroon Kumar Bhaduri, the father of fellow cast member Jaya Bhaduri. As cast members had read the script ahead of time, many were interested in playing different parts. Pran was considered for the role of Thakur Baldev Singh, but Sippy thought Sanjeev Kumar was a better choice. Initially, Dharmendra was also interested to play the role of Thakur. He eventually gave up the role when Sippy informed him that Sanjeev Kumar would play Veeru if that happened, and would be paired with Hema Malini, who Dharmendra was trying to woo. Dharmendra knew that Kumar was also interested in Malini. Sippy wanted Shatrughan Sinha to play the part of Jai, but there were already several big stars signed, and Amitabh Bachchan, who was not extremely popular yet, lobbied hard to get the part for himself. During the film's production, four of the leads became romantically involved. Bachchan married Bhaduri four months before filming started. This led to shooting delays when Bhaduri became pregnant with their daughter Shweta. By the time of the film's release, she was pregnant with their son Abhishek. Dharmendra had begun wooing Malini during their earlier film Seeta Aur Geeta (1972), and used the location shoot of Sholay to further pursue her. During their romantic scenes, Dharmendra would often pay the light boys to spoil the shot, thereby ensuring many retakes and allowing him to spend more time with her. The couple married five years after the film's release. Much of Sholay was shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, a town near Bangalore, Karnataka. The filmmakers had to build a road from the Bangalore highway to Ramanagara for convenient access to the sets. Art director Ram Yedekar had an entire township built on the site. A prison set was constructed near Rajkamal Studio in Mumbai, also outdoors, to match the natural lighting of the on-location sets. One part of Ramanagara was for a time called \"Sippy Nagar\" as a tribute to the director of the film. As of 2010[update], a visit to the \"Sholay rocks\" (where much the film was shot) was still being offered to tourists travelling through Ramanagara. Filming began on location on 3 October 1973, with a scene featuring Bachchan and Bhaduri. The film had a lavish production for its time (with frequent banquets and parties for the cast), took two and a half years to make, and went over budget. One reason for its high cost was that Sippy re-filmed scenes many times to get his desired effect. \"Yeh Dosti\", a 5-minute song sequence, took 21\u00a0days to shoot, two short scenes in which Radha lights lamps took 20\u00a0days to film because of lighting problems, and the shooting of the scene in which Gabbar kills the imam's son lasted 19\u00a0days. The train robbery sequence, shot on the Mumbai\u2013Pune railway route near Panvel, took more than 7\u00a0weeks to complete. Sholay was the first Indian film to have a stereophonic soundtrack and to use the 70\u00a0mm widescreen format. However, since actual 70\u00a0mm cameras were expensive at the time, the film was shot on traditional 35\u00a0mm film and the 4:3 picture was subsequently converted to a 2.2:1 frame. Regarding the process, Sippy said, \"A 70mm [sic] format takes the awe of the big screen and magnifies it even more to make the picture even bigger, but since I also wanted a spread of sound we used six-track stereophonic sound and combined it with the big screen. It was definitely a differentiator.\" The use of 70\u00a0mm was emphasised by film posters on which the name of the film was stylised to match the CinemaScope logo. Film posters also sought to differentiate the film from those which had come before; one of them added the tagline: \"The greatest star cast ever assembled\u00a0\u2013 the greatest story ever told\". The director's original cut of Sholay has a different ending in which Thakur kills Gabbar, along with some additional violent scenes. Gabbar's death scene, and the scene in which the imam's son is killed, were cut from the film by India's Censor Board, as was the scene in which Thakur's family is massacred. The Censor Board was concerned about the violence, and that viewers may be influenced to violate the law by punishing people severely. Although Sippy fought to keep the scenes, eventually he had to re-shoot the ending of the film, and as directed by the Censor Board, have the police arrive just before Thakur can kill Gabbar. The censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years. The original, unedited cut of the film finally came out in a British release on VHS in 1990. Since then, Eros International has released two versions on DVD. The director's cut of the film preserves the original full frame and is 204\u00a0minutes in length; the censored widescreen version is 198\u00a0minutes long.[a] Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory. Koushik Banerjea, a sociologist in the London School of Economics, notes that Sholay exhibits a \"sympathetic construction of 'rogue' masculinity\" exemplified by the likeable outlaws Jai and Veeru. Banerjea argues during the film, the moral boundary between legality and criminality gradually erodes. Film scholar Wimal Dissanayake agrees that the film brought \"a new stage in the evolving dialectic between violence and social order\" to Indian cinema. Film scholar M. Madhava Prasad states that Jai and Veeru represent a marginalised population that is introduced into conventional society. Prasad says that, through the elements of revenge included in the plot and the application of Jai and Veeru's criminality for the greater good, the narrative reflects reactionary politics, and the audience is compelled to accept feudal order. Banerjea explains that though Jai and Veeru are mercenaries, they are humanised by their emotional needs. Such dualism makes them vulnerable, in contrast to the pure evil of Gabbar Singh. Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, was well received by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty. Dissanayake explains that the audience was fascinated by the dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama. He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited. He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in Sholay, the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that Sholay can be viewed as a national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of Sholay, with its violence, revenge, and vigilante action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in the Emergency (rule by decree) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975. Dissanayeke and Sahai note that, although the film borrowed heavily from the Hollywood Western genre, particularly in its visuals, it was successfully \"Indianised\". As an example, William van der Heide has compared a massacre scene in Sholay with a similar scene in Once Upon a Time in the West. Although both films were similar in technical style, Sholay emphasised Indian family values and melodramatic tradition, while the Western was more materialistic and restrained in its approach. Maithili Rao, in Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema, notes that Sholay infuses the style of the Western genre into a \"feudalistic ethos\". Ted Shen of the Chicago Reader notes Sholay's \"hysterical visual style\" and intermittent \"populist message\". Cultural critic and Islamist scholar Ziauddin Sardar lampoons the film in his book The Secret Politics of Our Desires: Innocence, Culpability and Indian Popular Cinema, both for its caricature and stereotyping of Muslim and women characters, and for what he calls mockery of innocent villagers. Sardar notes that the two most prominent Muslim characters in the film are Soorma Bhopali (a buffoonish criminal), and an impotent victim of the bandits (the imam). Meanwhile, the sole function of one female character (Radha) is to suffer her fate in silence, while the other female lead (Basanti) is just a garrulous village belle. Some scholars have indicated that Sholay contains homosocial themes. Ted Shen describes the male bonding shown in the film as bordering on camp style. Dina Holtzman, in her book Bollywood and Globalization: Indian Popular Cinema, Nation, and Diaspora, states that the death of Jai, and resultant break of bonding between the two male leads, is necessary for the sake of establishing a normative heterosexual relationship (that of Veeru and Basanti). R. D. Burman composed the film's music, and the lyrics were written by Anand Bakshi. The songs used in the film, and released on the original soundtrack are listed below. Following that is a list of unused tracks and dialogues which were released later on an updated soundtrack. The song \"Mehbooba Mehbooba\" was sung by its composer, R. D. Burman, who received his sole Filmfare Award nomination for playback singing for his effort. The song, which is often featured on Bollywood hit song compilations, is based on \"Say You Love Me\" by Greek singer Demis Roussos. \"Mehbooba Mehbooba\" has been extensively anthologised, remixed, and recreated. A version was created in 2005 by the Kronos Quartet for their Grammy-nominated album You've Stolen My Heart, featuring Asha Bhosle. It was also remixed and sung by Himesh Reshammiya, along with Bhosle, in his debut acting film Aap Kaa Surroor (2007). \"Yeh Dosti\" has been called the ultimate friendship anthem. It was remixed and sung by Shankar Mahadevan and Udit Narayan for the 2010 Malayalam film Four Friends, and also in 2010 it was used to symbolise India's friendship with the United States during a visit from President Barack Obama. Several songs from the soundtrack were included in the annual Binaca Geetmala list of top filmi songs. \"Mehbooba Mehooba\" was listed at No.\u00a024 on the 1975 list, and at No.\u00a06 on the 1976 list. \"Koi Haseena\" was listed at No.\u00a030 in 1975, and No.\u00a020 in 1976. \"Yeh Dosti\" was listed at No.\u00a09 in 1976. Despite the soundtrack's success, at the time, the songs from Sholay attracted less attention than the film's dialogue\u2014a rarity for Bollywood. The producers were thus prompted to release records with only dialogue. Taken together, the album sales totalled an unprecedented 500,000\u00a0units, and became one of the top selling Bollywood soundtracks of the 1970s. Music critic Oli Marlow reviewed the soundtrack in 2013, calling it a unique fusion of religious, folk, and classical music, with influences from around the world. He also commented on the sound design of the film, calling it psychedelic, and saying that there was \"a lot of incredible incidental music\" in the film that was not included in the soundtrack releases. In a 1999 paper submitted to London's Symposium on Sound in Cinema, film critic Shoma A. Chatterji said, \"Sholay offers a model lesson on how sound can be used to signify the terror a character evokes. Sholay is also exemplary in its use of soundmatching to jump cut to a different scene and time, without breaking the continuity of the narrative, yet, intensifying the drama.\" Sholay was released on 15 August 1975, Indian Independence Day, in Mumbai. Due to lacklustre reviews and a lack of effective visual marketing tools, it saw poor financial returns in its first two weeks. From the third week, however, viewership picked up owing to positive word of mouth. During the initial slow period, the director and writer considered re-shooting some scenes so that Amitabh Bachchan's character would not die. When business picked up, they abandoned this idea. After being helped additionally by a soundtrack release containing dialogue snippets, Sholay soon became an \"overnight sensation\". The film was then released in other distribution zones such as Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, and Hyderabad on 11 October 1975. It became the highest grossing Bollywood film of 1975, and film ranking website Box Office India has given the film a verdict of \"All Time Blockbuster\". Sholay went on to earn a still-standing record of 60 golden jubilees[c] across India, and was the first film in India to celebrate a silver jubilee[d] at over 100 theatres. It was shown continuously at Mumbai's Minerva theatre for over five years. Sholay was the Indian film with the longest theatrical run until Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) broke its record of 286 weeks in 2001. Exact figures are not available on the budget and box office earnings of Sholay, but film trade websites provide estimates of its success. According to Box Office India, Sholay earned about \u20b9150\u00a0million nett gross[e] (valued at about US$16,778,000 in 1975)[b] in India during its first run, which was many times its \u20b930\u00a0million (valued at about US$3,355,000 in 1975)[b] budget. Those earnings were a record that remained unbroken for nineteen years, which is also the longest amount of time that a film has held the record. Its original gross was increased further with re-releases during the late 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. It is often cited that after adjusting the figures for inflation, Sholay is one of the highest grossing films in the history of Indian cinema, although such figures are not known with certainty. In 2012, Box Office India gave \u20b91.63 billion (US$25\u00a0million) as Sholay's adjusted net gross,[e] whereas Times of India, in a 2009 report of business of Indian films, reported over \u20b93 billion (US$46\u00a0million) as the adjusted gross. Initial critical reviews of Sholay were negative. Among contemporary critics, K.L. Amladi of India Today called the film a \"dead ember\" and \"a gravely flawed attempt\". Filmfare said that the film was an unsuccessful mincing of Western style with Indian milieu, making it an \"imitation western\u2014neither here nor there.\" Others labelled it as \"sound and fury signifying nothing\" and a \"second-rate take-off\" of the 1971 film Mera Gaon Mera Desh. Trade journals and columnists initially called the film a flop. In a 1976 article in the journal Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, author Michael Gallagher praised the technical achievement of the film, but otherwise criticised it stating, \"As a spectacle it breaks new ground, but on every other level it is intolerable: formless, incoherent, superficial in human image, and a somewhat nasty piece of violence\". Over time, the critical reception to Sholay greatly improved; it is now considered a classic, and among the greatest Hindi-language films. In a 2005 BBC review, the well-rounded characters and simple narrative of the film were commended, but the comical cameos of Asrani and Jagdeep were considered unnecessary. On the film's 35th anniversary, the Hindustan Times wrote that it was a \"trailblazer in terms of camera work as well as music,\" and that \"practically every scene, dialogue or even a small character was a highlight.\" In 2006, The Film Society of Lincoln Center described Sholay as \"an extraordinary and utterly seamless blend of adventure, comedy, music and dance\", labelling it an \"indisputable classic\". Chicago Review critic Ted Shen criticised the film in 2002 for its formulaic plot and \"slapdash\" cinematography, and noted that the film \"alternates between slapstick and melodrama\". In their obituary of the producer G.P. Sippy, the New York Times said that Sholay \"revolutionized Hindi filmmaking and brought true professionalism to Indian script writing\". Sholay was nominated for nine Filmfare Awards, but the only winner was M. S. Shinde, who won the award for Best Editing. The film also won three awards at the 1976\u00a0Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards (Hindi section): \"Best Actor in Supporting Role\" for Amjad Khan, \"Best Cinematographer (Colour)\" for Dwarka Divecha, and \"Best Art Director\" for Ram Yedekar. Sholay received a special award at the 50th Filmfare Awards in 2005: Best Film of 50 Years. Sholay has received many \"Best Film\" honours. It was declared the \"Film of the Millennium\" by BBC India in 1999. It topped the British Film Institute's \"Top 10 Indian Films\" of all time poll of 2002, and was voted the greatest Indian movie in a Sky Digital poll of one million British Indians in 2004. It was also included in Time Magazine's \"Best of Bollywood\" list in 2010, and in CNN-IBN's list of the \"100 greatest Indian films of all time\" in 2013. Sholay inspired many films and pastiches, and spawned a subgenre of films, the \"Curry Western\", which is a play on the term Spaghetti Western. It was an early and most definitive masala film, and a trend-setter for \"multi-star\" films. The film was a watershed for Bollywood's scriptwriters, who were not paid well before Sholay; after the film's success, script writing became a more respected profession. Certain scenes and dialogues from the film earned iconic status in India, such as \"Kitne aadmi the\" (How many men were there?), \"Jo dar gaya, samjho mar gaya\" (One who is scared is dead), and \"Bahut yaarana laagta hai\" (Looks like you two are very close)\u00a0\u2013 all dialogues of Gabbar Singh. These and other popular dialogues entered the people's daily vernacular. Characters and dialogues from the film continue to be referred to and parodied in popular culture. Gabbar Singh, the sadistic villain, ushered in an era in Hindi films characterised by \"seemingly omnipotent oppressors as villains\", who play the pivotal role in setting up the context of the story, such as Shakal (played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda) of Shaan (1980), Mogambo (Amrish Puri) of Mr. India (1987) and Bhujang (Amrish Puri) of Tridev (1989). Filmfare, in 2013, named Gabbar Singh the most iconic villain in the history of Indian cinema, and four actors were included in its 2010 list of \"80 Iconic Performances\" for their work in this film. The film is often credited with making Amitabh Bachchan a \"superstar\", two years after he became a star with Zanjeer (1973). Some of the supporting actors remained etched in public memory as the characters they played in Sholay; for example, Mac Mohan continued to be referred to as \"Sambha\", even though his character had just one line. Major and minor characters continue to be used in commercials, promos, films and sitcoms. Amjad Khan acted in many villainous roles later in his career. He also played Gabbar Singh again in the 1991 spoof Ramgarh Ke Sholay, and reprised the role in commercials. The British Film Institute in 2002 wrote that fear of Gabbar Singh \"is still invoked by mothers to put their children to sleep\". The 2012 film Gabbar Singh, named after the character, became the highest grossing Telugu film up to that point. Comedian Jagdeep, who played Soorma Bhopali in the film, attempted to use his Sholay success to create a spinoff. He directed and played the lead role in the 1988 film Soorma Bhopali, in which Dharmendra and Bachchan had cameos. In 2004, Sholay was digitally remastered and shown again to packed theatres in India, including Mumbai's Minerva, where it had run successfully 29\u00a0years earlier. An attempt to remake Sholay, Ram Gopal Varma's film Aag (2007), starring Amitabh Bachchan as the villain, was a commercial and critical disaster. Because of television and home media, Sholay is widely available and still popular. Twenty years after its release, Sholay was first shown on the Indian DD National television channel, where it drew the highest ratings ever for an Indian film broadcast. Video game producer Mobile2win released the \"Sholay Ramgarh Express\" game for mobile phones in 2004, along with other Sholay themed content such as wallpapers, video clips, and ringtones. Sholay has been the subject of two books and many articles. Wimal Dissanayake and Malti Sahai's Sholay, A Cultural Reading (1992) attempts a comprehensive scholarly study that sets the film within the broader history of popular cinema in India. Anupama Chopra's Sholay: The Making of a Classic (2000) provides an inside look at the film's production based on interviews with the director, stars, and crew members. Sholay has been labelled by Chopra as the gold standard in Indian cinema, and a reference point for audiences and trade analysts. Over the years, the film has reached a mythic stature in popular culture, and has been called the greatest Hindi film of all time. It belongs to only a small collection of films, including Kismet (1943), Mother India (1957), Mughal-e-Azam (1960) and Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994), which are repeatedly watched throughout India, and are viewed as definitive Hindi films with cultural significance. The lasting effect of Sholay on Indian cinema was summarised by Anupama Chopra, when in 2004 she called it \"no longer just a film, [but] an event\". In the 2000 book Sholay: The Making of a Classic, the noted director Shekhar Kapur stated \"there has never been a more defining film on the Indian screen. Indian film history can be divided into Sholay BC and Sholay AD\". The film was jointly released in Pakistan by Geo films and Mandviwalla Entertainment on 17 April 2015, almost 40 years after its theatrical release. The film's premiere in the country was held in Karachi. Filmmaker Ketan Mehta's company Maya Digital was responsible for converting Sholay into the 3D format. Mehta was approached by G. P. Sippy's grandson, Sasha Sippy, about the project in 2010. In March 2012, Shaan Uttam Singh, the grandson of producer G. P. Sippy, said that he would sponsor a conversion of the film to 3D, and release it in late 2012; this was later postponed to late 2013, and eventually finalised for 3 January 2014. It took \u20b9250 million (US$3.9\u00a0million) to convert Sholay to 3D. Under the leadership of computer animator Frank Foster, 350 people worked to convert the film into the digital 3D format, for which every scene had to be individually restored, colour-corrected and re-composited in 3D to match the depth.[f] New set-pieces, particularly those suited to the new format were also included, such as digital logs which scatter in the direction of the camera during the first half of the film when the train collides with them, the gunshot scene which frees Jai and Veeru from their handcuffs, and panoramic views of Gabbar's hideout in the caves. The theatrical trailer and release date were unveiled by the original script-writers Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar. The two original leads, Bachchan and Dharmendra, were also involved in promoting the re-release. The film was released in 1,000 screens in India, and additional screens overseas. It earned approximately \u20b9100 million (US$1.5\u00a0million) during its re-release, not enough to recover its conversion cost.",

The number 420 refers to Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, which prescribes the punishment for the offence of cheating; hence, \"Mr. 420\" is a derogatory term for a cheat. The film centers on Raj, a poor but educated orphan who comes to Bombay with dreams of success. Kapoor's character is heavily influenced by Charlie Chaplin's \"little tramp\", much like Kapoor's character in his 1951 Awaara. It was written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas, and the music was composed by the team of Shankar Jaikishan. The lyrics were penned by Shailendra. Shree 420 was the highest-grossing Indian film of 1955, and the song \"Mera Joota Hai Japani\" (\"My Shoes are Japanese\"), sung by Mukesh, became popular and a patriotic symbol of the newly independent India.   A country boy, Raj (Raj Kapoor), from Allahabad, travels to the big city, Bombay, by walking, to earn a living. He falls in love with the poor but virtuous Vidya (Nargis), but is soon seduced by the riches of a freewheeling and unethical lifestyle presented to him by an unscrupulous and dishonest businessman, Seth Sonachand Dharmanand (Nemo) and the sultry temptress Maya (Nadira). He eventually becomes a confidence trickster, or \"420,\" who even cheats in card gambling. Vidya tries hard to make Raj a good man but fails. Meanwhile, Sonachand comes up with another scheme to exploit poor people, whereby he promises permanent homes to them at just Rs. 100. The scheme pays off, as people start hoarding money for a home, even at the cost of other important things. Vidya's contempt for Raj increases even more. Raj becomes wealthy, but soon realizes that he paid a very high price for it. When Raj discovers that Sonachand has no plans to fulfill his promises, he decides to make wrongs right. Raj takes all the bond papers of the people's homes and tries to flee Sonachand's home, only to be caught by Sonachands and his cronies. In a scuffle that occurs, Sonachand shoots Raj and he falls unconscious. When people hear the shooting, they come and see Raj nearly dead. Sonachand tells police that Raj was trying to flee after stealing money from his safe, hence Sonachand shot him. Upon this, the 'dead' Raj springs back to life and using pure logic, proves Sonachand's guilt. Sonachand and his partners are arrested, while Vidya happily forgives Raj. The film ends with Raj saying \"Yeh 420 nahin, shree 420 hain\" (\"These are not simply con men, they are respectable con men\"). The title refers to section 420 of the Indian penal code, where crimes of theft and deception are punished, which relates to the troubles of the main character. In Sanskrit, the name of the main character, \"Vidya\", means knowledge, while \"Maya\" means Illusion. The title of one of the songs in the movie is \"Ramaiya Vastavaiya\" is in Telugu, which means 'Lord Ram, you will come'. The title alone is derived from an old Telugu folk song. Apart from that, rest of the song's lyrics (and the film) are in Hindi. The film grossed over Rs.20 million. This record was beaten 2 years later by Mother India in 1957. The song \"Mera Joota Hai Japani\", in which the singer asserts his pride in being an Indian despite his clothes being from other countries, became, and remains, a patriotic favourite among many Indians. It is often referenced, including in an acceptance speech at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2006 by Bengali author Mahasweta Devi. The movie proved to be popular in other countries, including the Soviet Union, Romania and Israel. In Russia, it was said that Raj Kapoor was as popular as Jawaharlal Nehru due to the success of the film. In Israel, the song \"Ichak Dana Beechak Dana\" (transliterated as \"Ichikidana\") became popular, and was re-recorded by local singer Naim Rajuan.",

        "full_text": " Silsila(Series of Events) is a 1981 Hindi romantic drama film directed by Yash Chopra. The film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Sanjeev Kumar, Rekha and Kulbhushan Kharbanda, with Shashi Kapoor in a special appearance. The movie is said to be loosely inspired by the alleged real-life love triangle of its three stars, Amitabh-Jaya-Rekha, the most talked about love affair back then. On his last birthday, Yash Chopra revealed that he originally wanted to cast Parveen Babi and Smita Patil opposite Bachchan, but after consulting him, he chose to cast Jaya Bhaduri and Rekha in their respective roles. This was also the last film to feature Rekha with Amitabh Bachchan, putting an end to this popular on-screen pair and their rumored off-screen affair. The film did only average business at the box office, faring much below expectations. Since its release, however, the film has gained a strong cult following and is today considered a classic in its treatment of the themes of abandonment and familial responsibility. Producer Yash Chopra considered this film and Lamhe his favourites. The movie's music became a \"superhit\" upon the release of the film and continues to be as popular.   Orphaned at very young age, brothers Shekhar Malhotra (Shashi Kapoor) and Amit Malhotra (Amitabh Bachchan) lead independent lives. Shekhar is a Squadron Leader with the Indian Air Force, and Amit is an emerging writer. Shekhar has fallen in love with the lovely Shobha (Jaya Bachchan), while Amit seeks to woo the attractive Chandni (Rekha). Amit finds professional success as a playwright in Delhi, enjoying a successful launch into the circles of Delhi's intellectual elite. Amit's passion and dedication to his craft wins Chandni's affections for Amit, and they share a brief, blissful period of courtship. Chandni's parents prepare to arrange her wedding to Amit. Both Shekhar and Amit plan to marry at the same time, but Shekhar is killed in air combat against PAF, leaving a pregnant Shobha behind. Taking pity on Shobha, Amit marries her and writes to Chandni to forget him. This news breaks Chandni's heart. She goes on to marry Dr. V.K. Anand (Sanjeev Kumar), who is in love with her. Tragedy strikes once more, and Shobha loses her child in a car accident. With no child to bind them together, Amit and Shobha drift apart. Amit runs into Chandni and they secretly rekindle their romance. They meet on the sly until a fateful night when Chandni accidentally hits a passerby on the way home from a tryst with Amit. The police get involved but Amit manages to hush the matter up. But the secrecy of the affair is endangered by the fact that the police inspector in charge of investigating the accident is Shobha's cousin (played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda), who is determined to expose Amit's affair with Chandni. Soon Amit decides that he can no longer continue his loveless marriage to Shobha and wishes to reconcile with Chandni. This news shatters Shobha\u2014who had long known of Amit's affair\u2014but she does not lose hope. She believes that if her love is true he will return to her. Similarly, Chandni's husband Dr. Anand is aware of and devastated by Chandni's infidelity. Dr. Anand leaves on a business trip, assuring Chandni he will be back soon, hopeful that she will be there when he returns. Amit and Chandni leave town to start a new life elsewhere, but tragedy strikes. Chandni's husband Dr. Anand's plane crashes, causing the lovers to rush to the wreckage site visible to them from the overhead helicopter they are making their escape in. Rushing into the fray to save Dr. Anand, Amit is confronted by Shobha, who in a moment of turmoil reveals that she is expecting his child. When Dr.Anand is rescued from the wreckage Chandni realises her love for her husband. The film ends with a song depicting Amit and Shobha living happily in marriage and an end title saying, \"Love is faith and faith is forever\". The music director was Shiv-Hari, and the lyrics were by Javed Akhtar. The song \"Rang Barse Bhige Chunar Wali\" is said to be one of India's best known folk songs. Its lyrics were by poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan. The song \"Dekha Ek Kwaab\" was shot in the Keukenhof tulip gardens in The Netherlands and some parts in Pahalgam. According to music expert Rajesh Subramanian the tune of 'Neela aasman so gaya' was actually composed by Shammi Kapoor. Kapoor made Bachchan hear it on the sets of Zameer. Bachchan suggested it to Yash Chopra and the latter incorporated it in Silsila. \"The marriage is a very, very sacred institution in India, and when the director created sympathy for the two lovers who were willing to go outside their marriage and continue their love affair, he didn't carry the audience with him\" - Pamela Chopra, wife of director Yash Chopra. Silsila did not do well at the box office, grossing just \u20b970 million (US$1.1\u00a0million), but since has achieved a cult status among Indian audiences. In an 1996 interview, director Chopra's wife Pamela Chopra commented on the financial disappointment calling the film a \"tad bit extra different\".",

Directed by Anees Bazmee, the film stars, Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif in lead roles. The film also featured a music video with Snoop Dogg. Released on 8 August 2008, a major part of the shooting was done in Australia. Akshay Kumar was also nominated for the Asian Film Awards under the Best Actor category for his performance in the film. Singh is Kinng was declared Superhit by Box Office India. The spelling of the word \"king\" in the film's title with an additional letter \"n\" was based on advice provided by a numerologist. This film is not related to the 2015 film Singh Is Bliing, which also starred Akshay Kumar and was rumored to be the sequel to Singh is Kinng.   Lakhan Singh (Sonu Sood), a.k.a. Lucky, is the \"kinng of the Australian underworld.\" He is accompanied by his Sikh mafia associates, Julie (Neha Dhupia), Mika (Jaaved Jaffrey), Pankaj Udaas (Yashpal Sharma), Raftaar (Sudhanshu Pandey), Dilbaugh Singh (Manoj Pahwa) and Guruji Gurbaksh Singh (Kamal Chopra). In a small village in Punjab, the birthplace of Lucky, there lives another Sikh, Happy Singh (Akshay Kumar). Happy, though good at heart, has unintentionally caused many problems in the village, and the villagers are fed up with him. They decide to send Happy on a long trip to Australia with his friend Rangeela (Om Puri) to bring Lucky back to Punjab, which will keep Happy out of the village for some time and bring peace to the village. But at the airport, Happy's and Rangeela's tickets to Australia are accidentally exchanged with those of Puneet (Ranvir Shorey), who was to fly to Egypt. In Egypt, Happy meets Sonia (Katrina Kaif) and falls deeply in love with her. But he does not express his love to her. Leaving her behind, he heads to Australia to meet Lucky. Lucky refuses to return to his hometown and throws Happy and Rangeela out of his house. Penniless, Happy finds warmth and affection in an elderly lady (Kirron Kher) who provides him with food in spite of being a stranger. Lucky winds up in hospital, paralyzed, after a series of violent incidents that Happy causes. (In one of these incidents, his head is bumped severely, and the trauma from the resultant concussion is what paralyzes him.) Unexpectedly, Happy is given the position of the Kinng! The lady who helped Happy is obviously worried and depressed, as her daughter is returning from Egypt with her wealthy boyfriend, Puneet. The daughter does not know that after the death of her father years ago, her mother had become poverty-stricken and been reduced to work as a flower seller. Happy gives her Lucky's spacious house and makes all his mafia associates work for her. The lady's daughter arrives\u2014and to Happy's horror, she is none other than Sonia! Happy, heart-broken, is forced to make a show of happiness to Sonia. Puneet says that he too would have had a good time with Happy and Sonia in Egypt had his ticket to Egypt not been exchanged in the airport, because of which he had ended up in Australia. Puneet had always been jealous of Sonia being with Happy; however, he doubts something going on between them. Meanwhile, Lucky's gang members spend enough time with the kindhearted Kinng for most of them to be reformed and give up lawless lives in favour of law-abiding ones. In spite of herself, Sonia falls in love with Happy and the truth becomes difficult to hide. Puneet sets his heart to marry Sonia. Sonia gets trapped in an emotional tug-of-war between Puneet, who loves her, and Happy, whom she loves. During the confusion, Happy's associates reveal to Puneet who they are, and that Happy is the Kinng of the Australian underworld, not a manager as Puneet had believed him to be. Puneet, in turn, reveals this to Sonia, who has become aware of her own poverty. Soon Puneet meets Mika, Lucky's other brother, who agrees to kill Happy. Puneet's motives to kill Happy, however, differ from Mika's: Puneet wants to kill Happy to keep Sonia away from him, whereas Mika wants to kill Happy to make himself Kinng. On the dawn of the wedding day, the sound of gunshots firing can be heard. Happy takes Sonia in order to save her\u2014and unknowingly, both run around the fire seven times, essentially getting married. (During all this, Lucky's head is bumped, and the trauma-induced paralysis he had suffered from is relieved.) Suddenly, Mika turns up on the spot, ready to kill Happy, armed with a gang and his new special glasses and hearing aid. As he is about to shoot, Lucky steps up and stops him. Then a dialogue ensues between Mika, Happy, Lucky, and the associates of the Kinng. Then Happy tells him that being the \"kinng\" is not as great as it may seem and explains him the characteristics of a true Sikh. Lucky confesses that he had always found being Kinng a source of misery, because a true kinng fights for others, not for himself. Overcome with remorse, Mika drops his gun. The movie ends with Happy's and Sonia's marriage. And Lucky and his gang a members return to their homes in the village. The music of the film was composed by Pritam and the lyrics were written by Mayur Puri. The title song was composed by the British bhangra band RDB. The soundtrack was launched officially at the IIFA Awards in Bangkok on 8 June 2008. Snoop Dogg also has a cameo in the video of the title song. Shreya Ghoshal who a sung the song Teri Ore won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer and the IIFA Award for Best Female Playback. Mayur Puri was nominated for the Star Screen Awards under the Best Lyrics category for the same song. The soundtrack of the film is as follows: Some members of the Sikh community had expressed their displeasure over the portrayal of Sikhs in the movie. On 1 August 2008, the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) wrote a letter to Sheila Dikshit, the chief minister of Delhi, asking her to ban the movie, as the trailer showed Akshay Kumar's character sporting a trimmed beard. But according to their religious guidelines, male Sikhs should not trim their beards, and the DSGMC found this offensive. After negotiations with the DSGMC authorities, the film was given clearance on 7 August 2008.",

It stars Naseeruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi playing the characters of a visually impaired principal and a sighted teacher in a school for the blind, where they fall in love though soon their complexes tag along and they struggle to get past them to reconnect with the \"touch\" of love. The film remains most memorable for the subtle acting of its leads, plus the handling of the issue of relationships with the visually handicapped, revealing the emotional and perception divide between the world, the \"blind\" and the \"sighted\", epitomized by the characters. The film won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. However the film's release was delayed by almost 4 years. The film won numerous awards including National Film Award \u2013 Best Actor for Naseeruddin Shah, while Sai Paranjpye got the Best Screenplay. At the Filmfare Awards, it won the top two: that of Best Movie and Filmfare Award \u2013 Best Director, plus a Best Dialogue Award for Sai Paranjpye. Further, Shabana Azmi was nominated for Best Actress, which she eventually won for the film Bhavna, while Naseeruddin Shah was nominated for Best Actor lost out to Anupam Kher in Saaransh.   This film is about the blind, in particular about the lives and feelings of blind children and the principal of their school. Sparsh refers to the sensation and feeling of touch upon which blind people rely in the absence of sight. The story opens with Anirudh Parmar (Naseeruddin Shah) as the principal of Navjivan Andhvidyalay, a school for the blind that educates about 200 blind children. Anirudh has a dark and lonely existence for the most part. One day, while on his way to the doctor, he hears a lovely song and ends up mesmerized at the singer's door instead of the doctor. The voice belongs to Kavita Prasad (Shabana Azmi), a young woman recently widowed after three years of marriage. Kavita, too, prefers a secluded existence. Her childhood friend Manju (Sudha Chopra) is about the only friend she has. Manju throws a small party where Kavita and Anirudh meet again. He recognizes her from her voice. During the conversation, he mentions that the school is looking for volunteers to read to, sing to, teach handicrafts and spend time with the children. Kavita is reluctant, but she is urged by Manju and her husband Suresh to strongly consider it. Kavita decides to volunteer. As Kavita spends more time at the school, she begins forming a friendship with Anirudh. The friendship grows stronger over time and they become engaged. But their personalities and feelings are different. Anirudh is of strong character: He firmly believes that the blind need help but not pity or charity. (When once, in his office, Kavita attempts to assist him with coffee, he gets enraged at the thought of his guest offering to overcome his obvious difficulty with hospitality.) Kavita, recently bereaved, looks to the school (and Anirudh) as a way towards an ideal, one of sacrificial service. Anirudh gets wind of this and assumes Kavita is simply seeking to fill the void in her life with this form of service. He assumes she accepted the proposal not out of love but as a sacrifice towards a way out of her dark life. During this time, Anirudh's fellow blind friend Dubey (Om Puri) laments that his recently deceased wife was not happy in their marriage. Anirudh is shaken, confused and disturbed by all this. He breaks off the engagement (but does not mention the reason to Kavita). She accepts his decision. Kavita, now a salaried employee of the school, continues to help the children. The initial coldness between her and Anirudh gives way to friction and eventually, over a series of events at the school, brings up the feelings they were not able to discuss before. The situation spirals downward and one of them must leave the school. The movie ends with Anirudh and Kavita being 'touched' by the depth of their feelings for one another and finally seeing a way out. Sparsh's music is by veteran music director Kanu Roy and lyrics are by Indu Jain.",

But KJo is an artisan with intellect and taste and he ensures that the script is spruced up and modernized with such elan that it doesn't offend the spectator's wisdom or intelligence. The accomplished director takes on familiar material and gives it an entirely new twirl. This is escapist cinema at its best! On the whole, Student of the Year is amongst Karan Johar's most accomplished works. The youth brigade would love it and those who have already passed that age would want to revisit those days. This one's entertainment, entertainment and entertainment at its best. Clearly, KJo has a winner on hands, yet again!\" Komal Nahta also gave it 4/5 calling it a \"supremely entertaining\" movie. Raedita Tandon of Filmfare gave it a 4/5 stars stating \"All in all, Karan\u2019s SOTY world is surreal and spectacular yet it has moments that will bring you back to reality and warm the cockles of your heart. This is escapism at its best.\" Joginder Tuteja of Indiaglitz gave the movie 4/5 stars and commented,\"With a fun outing like Student of the Year, Karan Johar has proven once again that he can fluctuate between making a relatively serious film like 'My Name Is Khan' and come back to candy floss youth entertainer in the mode of 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'. With an eye on some lavish entertainment translating on screen and bringing new talent to the industry, 'Student of the Year' is a winner.\" Madhureeta Mukherjee of The Times of India gave the film 3.5/5 stars, stating that \"Student of the Year takes you back to your books and sinks you in true-blue Bollywood syllabus, following the 'formula' \u2013 Two boys, one girl, one glorious trophy and lots of testosterone.

With medleys, dance, drama and everything good-looking (from cast to couches, dorms to discos).\" Indicine gave it 3.5/5 stars, commenting \"Overall, there isn\u2019t a dull moment in Student of the Year.

The film received widespread critical acclaim and a cult following from Indian and other South Asian audiences around the world.    Mohan Bhargava (Shah Rukh Khan) is an Indian who works as a project manager at NASA in the United States. He keeps worrying about Kaveri Amma (Kishori Ballal), a maid at his home in Uttar Pradesh who looked after him during his childhood days. After his parents\u2019 death, Kaveri Amma went to live in an old age home in Delhi and lost contact with Mohan. Mohan wishes to go to India and bring Kaveri Amma back with him to the US. He takes a few weeks off and travels to India. He goes to the old age home but learns that Kaveri Amma no longer lives there and went to a village named Charanpur a few years ago. Mohan then decides to travel to Charanpur, in Uttar Pradesh. Mohan decides to rent a caravan to reach the village fearing that he might not get the required facilities there. Upon reaching Charanpur, he meets Kaveri Amma and gets to know that it was Gita (Gayatri Joshi), Mohan\u2019s childhood friend, who had brought Kaveri Amma following her parents\u2019 death to stay with her. Gita runs a school in Charanpur and works hard to improve the living conditions of the villagers through education. However, the village is divided largely by caste and religious beliefs. Gita does not like Mohan\u2019s arrival as she thinks that he will take Kaveri Amma back with him to the US, leaving her and her younger brother Chikku alone. Kaveri Amma tells Mohan that she needs to get Gita married first, and that it is her responsibility. Gita believes in women empowerment and gender equality. This attracts Mohan towards Gita and he too tries to help her by campaigning for education among backward communities and also girls. Slowly love blossoms between Mohan and Gita. Kaveri Amma asks Mohan to visit a nearby village named Kodi, and collect money from a man named Haridas who owes it to Gita. Mohan visits Kodi and feels pity seeing Haridas' poor condition, which is such that he is unable to provide his family with meals everyday. Haridas tells Mohan that since his caste profession of a weaver wasn't earning him any money, he shifted to tenant farming.But this change in profession led to his ostracization from the village and the villagers even denied him water for his crops. Mohan understands the pathetic situation and realises that many villages in India are still like Kodi. He returns to Charanpur with a heavy heart and decides to do something for the welfare of Charanpur. Mohan extends his leave by three more weeks. He learns that electricity inconsistency and frequent power cuts are a big problem in Charanpur. He decides to set up a small hydroelectric power generation facility from a nearby water source. Mohan purchases all the equipment needed from his own funds and oversees the building of the power generation unit. The unit works and the village gets sufficient, consistent power from it. However, Mohan is repeatedly called by NASA officials as the NASA project he was working on is reaching important stages and he has to return to the US soon. Kaveri Amma tells him that she prefers to stay in Charanpur as it will be difficult for her to adapt to a new country at her age. Gita also tells him that she will not settle down in another country and she would prefer it if Mohan stayed in India with her. Mohan returns to the US with a heavy heart to complete the project. However, in the US, he has flashbacks of his time in India and wishes to return. After the successful completion of his project, he leaves the US and returns to India with intentions of working at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center, from where he can also work with NASA. The movie ends showing Mohan and Gita staying in Charanpur following their wedding. Swades is inspired by the story of Aravinda Pillalamarri and Ravi Kuchimanchi, the NRI couple who returned to India and developed the pedal power generator to light remote, off-the-grid village schools. Gowarikar spent considerable time with Aravinda and Ravi, both dedicated Association for India's Development (AID) volunteers. He supposedly visited Bilgaon, an Adivasi village in the Narmada valley, which is the backdrop of the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) movement. The people of Bilgaon are credited with doing 200 person-days of shramdaan (community service) to make their village energy self-sufficient. The Bilgaon project is recognised as a model for replication by the government of Maharashtra. Mahatma Gandhi's great-grandson, Tushar Gandhi noted the theme of Gandhism in the film. He found it unfortunate that the movie was not box office success The name of the main character portrayed by Shahrukh Khan is Mohan, which was Mahatma Gandhi's birth name (Mohandas or \"Mohan\"). Swades opens with the following quotation from Gandhi: Gowariker tries to address the lack of a scientific temperament and widespread ignorance among the rural folks through the energetic number \"Ye Tara Wo Tara\" where Mohan is seen encouraging the children to experience the fascinating world of stars through his telescope. In a symbolic manner, the song rejects the defunct divisions of caste and class and at the same time, through its protagonist, tries to instill in the audience an appreciation of curiosity and observation. The role of Mohan was first offered to Hrithik Roshan who refused after reading the script. Then Shahrukh Khan got this offer from Ashutosh Gowariker. Swades was the first Indian film to be shot inside the NASA research center at the Launch Pad 39A of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The rainfall monitoring satellite known as the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) in the film is an actual NASA mission and was launched in 2014. The film received overwhelmingly strong critical acclaim from critics. Most of the critics felt that Shahrukh Khan's performance in Swades was his best till date. Subhash K Jha of Indiatimes Movies gave 4.5 stars out of 5 and said \"Swades is a unique experiment with grassroot realism. It is so politically correct in its propagandist message that initially you wonder if the government of India funded the director's dream.\" Mayank Shekhar from MiD DAY gave 4 stars and called it 'bravo!' and added \"I cannot think of a better film for the longest that deserved a stronger recommendation for both touring cinemas of India's villages, and plush multiplexes of Mumbai or Manhattan.\" Jitesh Pillai of the Sunday Times of India gave 4 stars and said \"After Lagaan, what? The answer's blowing in the wind. Swades. Here's the verdict: This is a gusty and outstanding film. Welcome back to real, solid film-making.\" He added \"Swades is undoubtedly the No 1 movie of the year.\" Shradha Sukumaran of Mid-Day gave 3.5 stars and said \"At the end of it, Swades is a far braver film than Lagaan. It could have hit the high note \u2014 if it hadn't tried so hard.\" Avijit Ghosh wrote in The Telegraph, \"With its gentle humour, the film acts as an entertaining vehicle for social change. And hopefully, it will do more for positive nationalism than the Union government's Directorate of Audio Visual Publicity (DAVP) ads ever will.\" Swades went on to become a cult classic and Khan's performance as Mohan Bhargava is considered one of his best by many. Swades earned \u20b9152.5 million (US$2.4\u00a0million) nett in India. In the overseas market, the film made $2,790,000. It had a lifetime worldwide gross of \u20b9342.6 million (US$5.3\u00a0million). All lyrics written by Javed Akhtar; all music composed by A. R. Rahman. The Tamil soundtrack under the title Desam was composed by A.R. Rahman. All Lyrics were written by Vaali.",

'Saudamini' (Shabana Azmi) is a bright village girl with academic ambitions and an appetite for literature and philosophy. Her intellectual uncle (Utpal Dutt) indulges her brainy bent, encouraging her studies and running interference between Mini and her mother (Sudha Shivpuri), a pious widow whose only concern is to see Mini married, and quickly. Mini has a nascent love affair with her neighbor Narendra (Vikram), the zamindar's son, a student in Calcutta who on his frequent visits brings her Victorian literature, listens raptly to her discourse, and is bold enough to kiss her opportunistically when they are caught together in a rainstorm. Circumstances conspire against Mini and Narendra, though, and soon Mini finds herself married against her wishes to a wheat trader 'Ghanshyam' (Girish Karnad) from a neighboring village. Plunged into despair, Mini struggles to become accustomed to life in her unwanted marriage and her new home, where Ganshyam's stepmother seems to favor Mini's sisters-in-law and where her new husband treats her with a patience that she finds perplexing.

        "full_text": " Taal (English: Rhythm) is a 1999 Bollywood musical romantic drama film co written, edited, produced and directed by Subhash Ghai. Taal was an official selection for the 2005 Ebertfest: Roger Ebert's Film Festival. Taal was screened retrospectively, during the 2014 International Film Festival of India in the Celebrating Dance in Indian cinema section. The film stars Anil Kapoor, Akshaye Khanna, Aishwarya Rai, Amrish Puri and Alok Nath. It was also dubbed in Tamil as Thaalam. It was very successful in India and overseas, becoming the first Indian film to reach the top 20 on Variety's box office list. Anil Kapoor, A. R. Rahman, Alka Yagnik and Anand Bakshi each won a Filmfare Award for their work in the film.   Manav (Akshaye Khanna) comes to visit India with his wealthy father Jagmohan Mehta (Amrish Puri), his aunt and uncle, and his father's employees. In Chamba he meets Mansi (Aishwarya Rai), the beautiful daughter of a spiritual singer named Tara Babu (Alok Nath); Jagmohan Mehta owns the Mehta & Mehta group and is into investing in Chamba; their families meet, and Jagmohan and Tara Babu become acquainted and friendly toward each other. Manav and Mansi fall in love, but when Jagmohan learns of this he packs the family up and moves them to their house in Mumbai, with the excuse that Mansi and her father are of low social status. However, he is nice to Tara Babu's face and invites him to come and stay with him in Mumbai if he, Tara Babu, ever happens to be visiting there. Mansi is distressed by Manav's departure but he assures her that he will not abandon her and that everything will be fine. She gives Manav his scarf which she modified, making it say \"Manavsi\", a juxtaposition of their names. When Tara Babu learns of Manav and Mansi's affair he is at first angry but soon agrees to travel to Mumbai to visit his cousin Prabha, who is a news reporter, and to meet Manav's family. They are insulted by Jagmohan's sister-in-law, brother, and the employees and endure hostile treatment. They are forced to wait outside for 9 hours before being invited into the house. When Jagmohan finally arrives at the scene, he too insults Tara Babu, which results in Tara Babu slapping him across the face. Manav also arrives, and he rudely reprimands Tara Babu as well. Meanwhile Mansi, after witnessing Manav shout at her father, makes it clear to Manav that she wants nothing to do with him any more. She and her father then leave the Mehta household deeply hurt. Mansi soon meets Vikrant Kapoor (Anil Kapoor), a successful and famous music producer/director, who happens to be a fan of Tara Babu's work. With the encouragement of Prabha, she signs a three-year contract with Vikrant, and Mansi performs dance numbers and remixes of Tara Babu's songs as well as some of Vikrant's productions. She wins awards and becomes a sensation in India. In the meantime Vikrant starts to fall in love with Mansi. Matters are further complicated when Manav arrives to apologise to Mansi for what he and his family did, and she rejects him out of grief for how he treated her father. However, he tells her that he knows she still loves him, and that he will wait for her. Vikrant learns of what happened between Manav and Mansi, but he chooses to ignore it. He has a few encounters with Manav but takes them lightly. Vikrant proposes to Mansi soon afterwards, and her father and aunt encourage her to accept it, with the hope that it will help her forget Manav. She accepts the proposal even though she is not in love with Vikrant. After winning an International MTV Award in Canada, she comes back to India to prepare for the marriage. In the meantime Jagmohan and Tara Babu patch things up after Jagmohan realises his mistake. On the day of the marriage, Manav arrives and tells Mansi that by marrying Vikrant when she loves Manav she is deceiving both him and herself, and that marriage is not a contract but a union of two souls; he reminds her that he loves her and will never stop waiting for her. Jagmohan also comes to the wedding with Manav and Tara Babu. Vikrant soon realises, after seeing Mansi's reaction on seeing Manav, that she loves Manav. He assures her that the three of them can still be friends, and urges her to run to Manav. Jagmohan and Tara Babu give their blessings, and Manav and Mansi embrace. One of the last scenes shows everyone taking a family picture at the Mehta household after the wedding. The soundtrack of the film was composed by A. R. Rahman with lyrics penned by Anand Bakshi. Taal marked the beginning of a famed collaboration between A. R. Rahman and Subhash Ghai. They had earlier joined hands to work on a film titled Shikhar which was later shelved. The song \"Ishq Bina\" was initially composed for Shikhar. The soundtrack was released on 12 June 1999 and it become a big critical and commercial success. Its audio rights were bought by TIPS for a then record sum of \u20b9 50\u00a0million.[citation needed] At a press conference, Ghai remarked, \"I credit the name of the movie to composer A. R. Rahman. This movie is a romance and I could have called it any thing \u2013 Dil, Pyaar, Hum Bhaag Gaye, but it was A. R. Rahman's presence in the movie that gave me the confidence to call it Taal. Taal means music and music means Taal. The whole credit goes to A. R. Rahman and Anand Bakshi. Rahman kept me awake many nights, but after listening to the songs, I felt it was worth all the trouble.\" The soundtrack became a tremendous success, and was sold more than 18,50,000 units within a month of its release. The soundtrack made the list of \"Greatest Bollywood Soundtracks of All Time\", as compiled by Planet Bollywood. Rahman made a clean sweep of all the music awards that year except the National Film Award for Best Music Direction which went to Ismail Darbar for Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. Taal was a hit at the box office in India and was the third highest-grossing film of the year. It was also the highest-grossing film in the overseas markets that year. In the United States, it became the first Indian film to reach the top 20 on Variety's box office list. Taal also made the list of the weekly top ten grossing films in the United Kingdom. The film was screened at the Chicago International Film Festival and selected by Roger Ebert for his 2005 Overlooked Film Festival. Anil Kapoor won many awards for his role as Vikrant Kapoor (the role went to him after Govinda declined it) including Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award, IIFA Best Supporting Actor Award, Zee Cine Best Supporting Actor Award, and Star Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor Award. Singer Alka Yagnik won the Filmfare award for Best Female Playback for the song \"Taal Se Taal Mila\". Composer A. R. Rahman also received a number of awards for his work in the film, including a Filmfare Best Music Director Award, an IIFA Best Music Director Award, and a Zee Cine Award for Best Music Director.",

        "full_text": " Taare Zameen Par (titled Like Stars on Earth internationally) is a 2007 Indian drama film produced and directed by Aamir Khan. Darsheel Safary stars as 8-year-old Ishaan, and Khan plays his art teacher. Creative director and writer Amole Gupte initially developed the idea with his wife Deepa Bhatia, who served as the film's editor. Visual effects are by Tata Elxsi's Visual Computing Labs, and the title animation\u2014the first use of clay animation in a Bollywood film\u2014was created by Dhimant Vyas. Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy composed the film's score, and Prasoon Joshi wrote the lyrics for many of the songs. Principal photography took place in Mumbai and in Panchgani's New Era High School, and some of the school's students make appearances. The film explores the life and imagination of Ishaan, an 8-year-old dyslexic child. Although he excels in art, his poor academic performance leads his parents to send him to a boarding school. Ishaan's new art teacher suspects that he is dyslexic and helps him to overcome his disability. The film made its theatrical debut in India on 21 December 2007, and UTV Home Entertainment released a DVD for Indian audiences in 2008. Disney's later release of the international edition DVD marked the first purchase of distribution rights for an Indian film by a global company. Taare Zameen Par has received numerous awards, including the Filmfare Best Film Award for 2008 and the 2008 National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare. It was India's official entry for the 2009 Academy Awards Best Foreign Film, but did not progress to the short-list.   Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi (Darsheel Safary) is an 8-year-old boy who dislikes school and fails every test or exam. He finds all subjects difficult, and is belittled and berated by his teachers and classmates. But Ishaan's internal world is full of wonders that he is unable to convey to others, magical lands filled with colour and animated animals. He is an artist whose talent is unrecognised. Ishaan's father, Nandkishore Awasthi (Vipin Sharma), is a successful executive who expects his children to excel. His mother, housewife Maya Awasthi (Tisca Chopra), is frustrated by her inability to educate her son. Ishaan's elder brother, Yohaan (Sachet Engineer), is an exemplary scholar and athlete, which Ishaan is frequently reminded of. After receiving a particularly poor academic report, Ishaan's parents send him to a boarding school. There he sinks into a state of fear and depression, despite being befriended by Rajan Damodharan (Tanay Chheda), a physically disabled boy and one of the top students in the class. He even contemplates suicide by climbing up the fence in a terrace, which Rajan manages to save him from. Ishaan's situation changes when a new art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan), joins the school's faculty. An instructor at the Tulips School for young children with developmental disabilities, Nikumbh's teaching style is markedly different from that of his strict predecessor, and he quickly observes that Ishaan is unhappy and contributes little to class activities. He reviews Ishaan's work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of dyslexia. On his day off, Nikumbh sets off to Mumbai, to visit Ishaan's parents. Nikumbh is surprised to learn that Ishaan is passionate about painting, and shows great talent in art. Nikumbh then asks Mr Awasthi as to why he sent Ishaan to a boarding school. Mr Awasthi replies that Ishaan was an ill-mannered boy and was a poor student. Nikumbh shows Ishaan's mother her son's notebooks and gives an analysis of the script. Nikumbh deduces that Ishaan has severe difficulty in understanding letters and words. Mr Awasthi tries to dismiss it as a mere excuse for Ishaan's laziness. Nikumbh demonstrates what Ishaan experiences every day at school. He states that Ishaan has dyslexia as well as he may be having other conditions, which make him a difficult child. Mr Awasthi bluntly categorizes it as mental retardation, but Nikumbh criticizes him. Nikumbh argues that Ishaan is an above average child and processes information differently. He further states that Mr Awasthi failed to understand Ishaan and as a result the latter is facing low self-esteem and no longer paints, and Mr Awasthi regrets everything he did to Ishaan. Nikumbh returns, and subsequently brings up the topic of dyslexia in class, and offers a list of famous people who were dyslexic. Later, Nikumbh reveals to Ishaan, that he too is a dyslexic and faced problems similar to Ishaan. Nikumbh then visits the school's principal and obtains his permission to become Ishaan's tutor. He attempts to improve Ishaan's reading and writing by using remedial techniques developed by dyslexia specialists; Ishaan soon develops an interest in language and mathematics, and his grades improve. Towards the end of the school year, Nikumbh organises an art fair for the staff and students. The competition is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan is getting into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh, who gives him a hug and tells him to return next year. The film ends with a freeze-frame shot of Nikumbh tossing Ishaan into the air. The husband and wife team of Amole Gupte and Deepa Bhatia developed the story that would eventually become Taare Zameen Par as a way of understanding why some children cannot conform to a conventional educational system. Their initial work began as a short story that evolved into a screenplay over seven years. Deepa Bhatia later stated in an interview with The Hindu that her original inspiration was not dyslexia but rather the childhood of Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who performed poorly in school. Her goal was thus to explore the story of \"a child who did not fit into the school stream.\" She referenced a specific moment in Kurosawa's biography where he began to excel after meeting an attentive art teacher, and noted that this scene \"became the inspiration for how a teacher could transform the life of a student\". In developing the character of a young boy based on Kurosawa, Bhatia and Gupte explored some possible reasons why he failed in school. Their research led them to groups such as the Maharashtra Dyslexia Association and Parents for a Better Curriculum for the Child (PACE). Dyslexia eventually became the central topic and theme of the film. The pair worked with dyslexic children to research and develop the screenplay, basing characters and situations on their observations. Bhatia and Gupte carefully concealed the children's identities in the final version of the script. \"While Amole has written what I think is a brilliant and moving script, his contribution towards the film is not limited to that of a writer. The entire pre-production was done by him including the most important task of creating the music\u00a0... he has been present on set throughout the shooting as the Creative Director, and has been a big support and strong guiding force in my debut as a director. I thank him for that, and more so for having the faith in me by entrusting to me something that is so close to him.\" Khan and Gupte first met in college. Khan has said that he admired Gupte's abilities as an actor, writer, and painter. Three years before the film's release Gupte brought Khan to the project as a producer and actor. Gupte himself was to direct, but the first week's dailies were a great disappointment to Khan, who \"lost faith in Amol and his capability of translating on screen what he had so beautifully written on paper\". Khan was on the verge of withdrawing his participation in the film because of these \"creative differences\", but Gupte kept him onboard by stepping down as director. Contrary to Khan's claim, Gupte lashed out saying that after the wrap-up party, Khan announced that he was the director of the film, despite Gupte acting as director. Had it been necessary to hire a third party, production would have been postponed for 6\u20138\u00a0months as the new director prepared for the film. Keen to keep Safary as Ishaan\u2014the actor might have aged too much for the part had production been delayed\u2014Khan took over the role of director. Taare Zameen Par was Khan's first experience in the dual role of actor and director. He has admitted that the transition was challenging, stating that while he had always wanted to direct a film, it was unknown territory for him. Gupte remained on set, \"guiding [Khan] and, at times, even correcting [him]\". Initially the film was to retain the short story's title of \"High Jump\", because of Ishaan's inability to achieve the high jump in gym class. This subplot\u2014filmed but later cut\u2014tied into the original ending for the movie. In this rendition, a \"ghost image\" separates from Ishaan after the art competition and runs to the sports field; the film would end on a freeze frame of Ishaan successfully making the leap. Khan, however, was unhappy with that proposed ending and convinced Gupte to rewrite it. With the working title no longer relevant, Khan, Gupte, and Bhatia discussed several alternatives, eventually deciding on Taare Zameen Par. Possible translations of this title include Stars on the Ground and Stars on Earth. According to Khan: Taare Zameen Par is a film about children and it is a film which celebrates the abilities of children. Taare Zameen Par is a title which denotes that aspect. It is a title with a very positive feel to it. All the kids are special and wonderful. They are like stars on earth. This particular aspect gave birth to the title. Principal photography for the film took place in India over five months. Khan spent his first two days as director blocking the first scene to be filmed\u2014Ishaan returning home from school and putting away his recently collected fish\u2014and becoming comfortable with his new responsibilities. Believing that the audience should not be aware of the camera, he chose a simple shooting style for the film that involved relatively little camera movement. At the same time, Khan also made use of illusory camera tricks. For example, the opening scene of Ishaan collecting fish outside his school was shot on location and at Film City. Shots focusing on Ishaan took place at the former, while those involving the gutter terrarium were filmed at a water tank at the latter. The tank's water often became murky because the mud would rise to the top, forcing production to constantly empty and refill it. Due to this hindrance, the scene took eight hours to film. The film's next sequence involved Ishaan playing with two dogs. To compensate for the \"absolutely petrified\" Safary, most joint shots used a body double, though other portions integrated close-up shots of the actor. Ishaan's nightmare\u2014he becomes separated from his mother at a train station and she departs on a train while he is trapped in a crowd\u2014was filmed in Mumbai on a permanent railway-station set. To work around the train set piece's immobility, production placed the camera on a moving trolley to create the illusion of a departing train. For the sequences related from the mother's point of view\u2014shot from behind the actress\u2014Chopra stood on a trolley next to a recreated section of the train's door. All the school sequences were filmed on location. The production team searched for a Mumbai school with an \"oppressive\" feel to establish the \"heaviness of being in a metropolitan school\", and eventually chose St. Xavier's School. As the school is situated along a main road filming took place on weekends, to minimise the background noise, but an early scene in which Ishaan is sent out of the classroom was filmed on the day of the Mumbai Marathon. The production staff placed acrylic sheets invisible to the naked eye on the classroom windows to mask the sounds of nearby crowds and helicopters. New Era High School served as Ishaan's boarding school. The change of setting was a \"breath of fresh air\" for the production crew, who moved from Ishaan's small house in Chembur to the \"vast, beautiful environs\" of Panchgani. Production relied on stock footage for the brief scene of a bird feeding its babies. Khan carefully selected a clip to his liking, but learned three weeks before the film's release that the footage was not available in the proper format. With three days to replace it or else risk delaying the release, Khan made do with what he could find. He says that he \"cringes\" every time he sees it. Real schoolchildren participated throughout the movie's filming. Khan credited them with the film's success, and was reportedly very popular with them. Furthermore, Khan placed a high priority on the day-to-day needs of his child actors, and went to great lengths to attend to them. The production staff made sure that the students were never idle, and always kept them occupied outside of filming. New Era Faculty Coordinator Douglas Lee thought the experience not only helped the children to learn patience and cooperation, but also gave them a better understanding of how they should behave towards children like Ishaan who have problems in school. Because filming at New Era High School occurred during the winter holiday, those portraying Ishaan's classmates gave up their vacation to participate. To fill out the campus background, students from nearby schools were also brought in. A total of 1,500\u00a0children were used for wide-shots of the film's art-fair climax; medium shots only required 400\u00a0students. New to acting, the children often made errors such as staring into the camera, and Khan resorted to unorthodox methods to work around their rookie mistakes. For example, an early scene in the film featured a school assembly; Khan wanted the students to act naturally and to ignore the principal's speech, but recognised that this would be a difficult feat with cameras present. First Assistant Director Sunil Pandey spoke continuously in an attempt to \"bore the hell out of [them]\", and they eventually lost interest in the filming and behaved normally. A later scene involved Nikumbh enlightening his class about famous people who suffer from dyslexia, and the children's responses to his speech were the last portion to be filmed. Having already spent 3\u20134\u00a0days hearing the dialogue the children's reactions were \"jaded\". Khan opted to film them while he recited a tale, and manipulated his storytelling to achieve the varying spontaneous reactions. The following scene had the children playing around a nearby pond. Horrified when he learned that the water was 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m) deep, Khan recruited four lifeguards in case a child fell in. Khan found it important that the audience connect the film to real children, and had Pandey travel throughout India filming documentary-style footage of children from all walks of life. Those visuals were integrated into the end credits. While claymation has been used in Indian television commercials, the film's title sequence\u2014a representation of Ishaan's imagination\u2014marked its first instance in a Bollywood film. Khan gave claymation artist Dhimant Vyas free rein over the various elements. The storyboarding took one and a half months and the shooting required 15\u00a0days. The \"3 into 9\" sequence, in which Ishaan delves into his imagination to solve a math problem, was originally conceived as a 3D animation. Halfway through its creation, however, Khan felt it was not turning out as he had envisioned it. Khan scrapped the project and hired Vaibhav Kumaresh, who hand-drew the scene as a 2D animation. Artist Samir Mondal composed Ishaan and Nikumbh's art-fair watercolour paintings. He held a workshop with the schoolchildren, and incorporated elements from their artwork into Ishaan's. Mondal also instructed Khan on a painter's typical mannerisms and movements. Gupte created the rest of Ishaan's artwork and Assistant Art Director Veer Nanavati drew Ishaan's flipbook. The art department's designs for Ishaan's school notebooks disappointed Khan, who had familiarised himself with dyslexic writing. Using his left hand, Khan instead wrote it himself. The musical sequence of \"Jame Raho\" establishes the characters of the four members of Ishaan's family; for example, the father is hardworking and responsible, and Yohaan is an \"ideal son\" who does all the right things. A robotic style of music overlaps most of the sequence\u2014this is mirrored by the machine-like morning routines of the mother, father, and Yohaan\u2014but changes for Ishaan's portion to imply that he is different from the rest. This concept is furthered by speed ramping and having the camera sway with the music to create a distinct style. The twilight scenes of \"Maa\" were a particular issue for the production crew. Because the specific lighting only lasted ten to fifteen minutes a day, the scenes took nearly ten evenings to film. Production at one time considered having a child singing, but ultimately deemed it too over the top and felt it would connect to more people if sung by an adult. Shankar initially performed the song as a sample\u2014they planned to replace him with another singer\u2014but production eventually decided that his rendition was best. Ishaan's truancy scene\u2014he leaves school one day after realising that his mother has not signed his failed math test\u2014originally coincided with the song \"Kholo Kholo,\" but Khan did not believe it worked well for the situation. In his opinion, the accompanying song should focus on what a child wants\u2014to be free\u2014and be told from the first-person perspective instead of \"Kholo Kholo\"'s second person. When Khan took over as director, he opted to use \"Mera Jahan\"\u2014a song written by Gupte\u2014and moved \"Kholo Kholo\" to the art fair. Viewers of test screenings were divided over the truancy scene. Half thoroughly enjoyed it but the rest complained that it was too long, did not make sense, and merely showed \"touristy\" visuals of Mumbai. Khan nevertheless kept the scene, because he \"connected deeply\" with it and felt that it established Ishaan's world. Shiamak Davar choreographed the dance sequence of \"Bum Bum Bole,\" and was given free rein over its design. He had intended to use 40\u00a0students from his dance school, but Khan did not want trained dancers. Davar gave the children certain cues and a general idea of what to do, but left the style and final product up to them to avoid a choreographed appearance. Time constraints meant that while Khan was busy filming \"Bum Bum Bole,\" Ram Madhvani took over as director for \"Bheja Kum\". The latter sequence, containing a \"fun-filled\" song of rhythmic dialogue, allowed the audience to perceive how Ishaan sees the world and written languages. It was intended to represent \"a young boy's worst nightmare, in terms of\u00a0... the worst thing that he can think of\"; Madhvani based the visual concept on his son's fear of \"creepy-crawlies\" such as cockroaches, dragonflies, and lizards. Tata Elxsi's Visual Computing Labs made the creatures out of the English alphabet and numbers, although Khan insisted they include the Hindi alphabet as not all the audience would be familiar with English. The chalkboard writing's transformation into a snake was included to surprise the audience and \"end the song on a high note.\" In writing the song \"Taare Zameen Par,\" lyricist Prasoon Joshi followed the theme of \"however much you talk about children, it's not enough.\" Every line throughout the song describes children, and only one repeats: \"Kho Naa Jaaye Yeh / Taare Zameen Par\" (\"Let us not lose these / Little stars on earth\"). The song is mostly set to the annual day performance by the developmentally disabled children of Tulips School. Actual students from Tulips School and Saraswati Mandir participated, and were filmed over a period of five days. The sequence originally featured numerous dance performances, but was trimmed down when test audiences found it too long. A song accompanying the scene in which Ishaan's mother is watching home videos of her son was also cut, and replaced with background music after test audiences expressed their opposition to yet another song. Timing and other aspects are usually planned when scoring a film, but Khan chose to take a more improvised approach. Instead of using a studio, he and the trio Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy recorded it at Khan's home in Panchgani, to clear their heads and not be in the mindset of the city. As they watched the film, Khan pointed out when he wanted music to begin and of what type. Ehsaan Noorani noted that this strategy allowed the score to have a \"spontaneity to it.\" Different styles of background music were used to convey certain things. For example, a guitar is played when Ishaan is tense or upset, sometimes with discordant notes. The music of the opening scene\u2014the recurring \"Ishaan's Theme,\" which represents the character's peace of mind\u2014overpowers the background noise to show that Ishaan is lost in his own world; the noise becomes louder after he snaps back to reality. But the scene in which Nikumbh explains dyslexia to Ishaan's family took the opposite approach. Silent at first, the music is slowly introduced as the father begins to understand his son's dilemma. The almost seven-minute long scene scarcely used any background music, to slow the pace and make it seem more realistic. Taare Zameen Par was released worldwide on 21 December 2007, although countries such as Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Fiji opened it on 20 December. It debuted in India with 425\u00a0prints, although revenue-sharing issues between the film's distributors and theatre owners caused some slight delays. The movie grossed \u20b9150 million (US$2.3\u00a0million) domestically within the first three days. Its theatre occupancy in Mumbai dropped to 58 percent during its third week, but climbed back to 62 percent the following week\u2014this brought the total to \u20b9770 million (US$12\u00a0million)\u2014after the Maharashtra government granted the film exemption from the entertainment tax. Anticipating further tax exemption in other states, world distributor PVR Pictures circulated 200 more prints of the film. The film completed its domestic run with $19,779,215. To reach more audiences, the film was later dubbed in the regional languages of Tamil and Telugu. Both were scheduled for release on 12 September 2008, the former under the title Vaalu Nakshatram. It grossed $1,223,869 in the US by its seventh week, and \u00a3351,303 in the UK by its ninth week. Reports regarding the film's worldwide gross have conflicted, with sources citing \u20b9889.7 million (US$14\u00a0million), \u20b91.07 billion (US$17\u00a0million), \u20b91.31 billion (US$20\u00a0million), and \u20b91.35 billion (US$21\u00a0million). In response to Khan's support for the Narmada Bachao Andolan and his criticism of Chief Minister Narendra Modi, approximately 50\u00a0activists of the Sardar Patel Group conducted protests outside of PVR and INOX theatres in Vadodara, Gujarat. The group also issued statements to all the multiplexes of Gujarat, suggesting that the film not be screened unless Khan apologised for his comments. The INOX cinema eventually boycotted the film; INOX Operations Manager Pushpendra Singh Rathod stated that \"INOX is with Gujarat, and not isolated from it\". The International Dyslexia Association screened Taare Zameen Par on 29 October 2008 in Seattle, Washington. Khan noted in his official blog that there were about 200\u00a0people in the audience and that he was \"curious to see the response of a non-Indian audience to what we had made.\" He felt some concern that Taare Zameen Par was shown in a conference room rather than a cinema hall and was projected as a DVD rather than as a film. He said that the showing concluded to an \"absolutely thunderous standing ovation\" which \"overwhelmed\" him and that he \"saw the tears streaming down the cheeks of the audience.\" Khan also noted that the reaction to the film \"was exactly as it had been with audiences back home in India\". Taare Zameen Par received several positive reviews. Subhash K. Jha suggests that the film is \"a work of art, a water painting where the colors drip into our hearts, which could easily have fallen into the motions of over-sentimentality. Aamir Khan holds back where he could easily resort to an extravagant display of drama and emotions.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN argued that the true power of the film lies in its \"remarkable, rooted, rock-solid script which provides the landscape for such an emotionally engaging, heart-warming experience.\" Manish Gajjar from the BBC stated that the film \"touches your heart and moves you deeply with its sterling performances. [It is] a film full of substance!\" Jaspreet Pandohar, also of BBC, posited that Taare Zameen Par is a \"far cry from the formulaic masala flicks churned out by the Bollywood machine,\" and is \"an inspirational story that is as emotive as it is entertaining; this is a little twinkling star of a movie.\" Furthermore, Aprajita Anil of Screen gave the film four stars and stated, \"Taare Zameen Par cannot be missed. Because it is different. Because it is delightful. Because it would make everyone think. Because it would help everyone grow. Because very rarely do performances get so gripping. And of course because the 'perfectionist' actor has shaped into a 'perfectionist' director.\" In addition, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap stated that, \"Taare Zameen Par took me back to my hostel days. If you take away the dyslexia, it seems like my story. The film affected me so deeply that I was almost left speechless. After watching the film, I was asked how I liked Taare Zameen Par. I could not talk as I was deeply overwhelmed.\" However, there were some criticisms. Jha's only objection to the film was Nikumbh's \"sanctimonious lecture\" to Ishaan's \"rather theatrically-played\" father. Jha found this a jarring \"deviation from the delectable delicacy\" of the film's tone. Although she applauded the film overall and recommended \"a mandatory viewing for all schools and all parents\", Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India believed the second half was \"a bit repetitive,\" the script needed \"taut editing,\" and Ishaan's trauma \"[seemed] a shade too prolonged and the treatment simplistic.\" Despite commending the \"great performances\" and excellent directing, Gautaman Bhaskaran of The Hollywood Reporter, too, suggested that the movie \"suffers from a weak script.\" Likewise, Derek Kelly of Variety criticised it for what he described as its \"touchy-feely-ness\" attention to \"a special needs kid's plight.\" Kelly also disliked the film for being \"so resolutely caring\u00a0... and devoid of real drama and interesting characters\" that \"it should have 'approved by the Dyslexia Assn.' stamped on the posters.\" In his article \"Taare Zameen Par and dyslexic savants\" featured in the Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology, Ambar Chakravarty noted the general accuracy of Ishaan's dyslexia. Though Chakravarty was puzzled by Ishaan's trouble in simple arithmetic\u2014a trait of dyscalculia rather than dyslexia\u2014he reasoned it was meant to \"enhance the image of [Ishaan's] helplessness and disability\". Labeling Ishaan an example of \"dyslexic savant syndrome\", he especially praised the growth of Ishaan's artistic talents after receiving help and support from Nikumbh, and deemed it the \"most important (and joyous) neurocognitive phenomenon\" of the film. This improvement highlights cosmetic neurology, a \"major and therapeutically important issue\" in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology. Likewise, in their article \"Wake up call from 'Stars on the Ground'\" for the Indian Journal of Psychiatry, T. S. Sathyanarayana Rao and V. S. T. Krishna wrote that the film \"deserves to be vastly appreciated as an earnest endeavor to portray with sensitivity and empathetically diagnose a malady in human life\". They also felt it blended \"modern professional knowledge\" with a \"humane approach\" in working with a dyslexic child. However, the authors believed the film expands beyond disabilities and explores the \"present age where everyone is in a restless hurry\". The pair wrote, \"This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives. We seem to be heading to a state of mass scale mindlessness even as children are being pushed to 'perform'. Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of 'achievement' and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?\" The film depicts how \"threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children\", and that teachers should instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan \"dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities\". Overall, the pair found a \"naive oversimplification\" in the film. With India \"only recently waking to recognizing the reality and tragedy of learning disability\", however, they \"easily [forgave the film's fault] under artistic license\". The film raised awareness of the issue of dyslexia, and prompted more open discussions among parents, schools, activists, and policymakers. Anjuli Bawa, a parent-activist and founder of Action Dyslexia Delhi, said that the number of parents who visit her office increased tenfold in the months following the film's release. Many began taking a more proactive approach by contacting her after noticing problems, rather than using her as a last resort. Gupte himself received \"many painful letters and phone calls\" from Indian parents. He noted, \"Fathers weep on the phone and say they saw the film and realized that they have been wrong in the way they treated their children. This is catharsis.\" These reactions have also brought about a change in policies. The film, only ten days after its debut, influenced the Central Board of Secondary Education to provide extra time to special children\u2014including the visually impaired, physically challenged and dyslexic\u2014during exams. In 2008, Mumbai's civic body also opened 12\u00a0classrooms for autistic students. In Chandigarh, the education administration started a course to educate teachers on how to deal with children with learning disabilities. Among its many awards, Taare Zameen Par won the Filmfare Best Film Award for 2008, as well as the National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare. Khan's directorial role and Safary's performance were recognized at the 2008 Zee Cine Awards, 2008 Filmfare Awards, and 4th Apsara Film & Television Producers Guild Awards. Taare Zameen Par was initially acclaimed as India's official entry for the 2009 Academy Awards Best Foreign Film, but after it failed to progress to the short list, a debate began in the Indian media as to why Indian films never win Academy Awards. Speculation for the reasons behind Taare Zameen Par's failed bid included Rediff.com's Arthur J. Pai's observation that it lacked mainstream media attention; AMPAS jury member Krishna Shah criticised its length and abundance of songs. \"Three days before Chandni Chowk [to China] hit theaters in the U.S. and India, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced its shortlist of nine films edging closer to a foreign-language nomination. India's submission, the powerful and moving Taare Zameen Par by Aamir Khan, didn't make the cut. Sadly, that film never will be seen by mainstream American audiences; yet Chandni Chowk is enjoying a hefty publicity push. If only Taare Zameen Par could have gotten its hands on that magic potato.\" Khan claimed that he was \"not surprised\" that Taare Zameen Par was not included in the Academy Award shortlist, and argued, \"I don\u2019t make films for awards. I make films for the audience. The audience, for which I have made the film, really loved it and the audiences outside India have also loved it. What I am trying to say is that film has been well loved across the globe and that for me it is extremely heartening and something that I give very high value to.\" The Indian news media also frequently compared Taare Zameen Par's nomination failure with the British film Slumdog Millionaire's multiple Academy Award nominations and wins, and noted that other Indian films in the past were overlooked. Film critic Rajeev Masand argued that it is difficult to compare the two films and noted that Slumdog Millionaire was being marketed in a way that Indian films such as Taare Zameen Par could not compete with. In this context, Slumdog Millionaire actor Mahesh Manjrekar stated, \"I\u2019m sad that Aamir\u2019s Taare Zameen Par didn\u2019t make it to the final round of the Oscars. I thought it to be way better than Slumdog [Millionaire]..., without taking away anything from Boyle and the kids. But, Indian movies are underestimated there.\" UTV Home Entertainment released the film on DVD in India on 25 July 2008. It was launched at Darsheel Safary's school, Green Lawns High School, in Mumbai. Aamir Khan, Tisca Chopra, Vipin Sharma, Sachet Engineer, and the rest of the cast and crew were present. In his speech, Khan stated, \"Darsheel is a very happy child, full of life and vibrant. I am sure it's because of the way his parents and teachers have treated him. I must say Darsheel's principal Mrs. Bajaj has been extremely supportive and encouraging. The true test of any school is how happy the kids are and by the looks of it, the children here seem really happy.\" Walt Disney Company Home Entertainment, which acquired 33\u00a0percent of UTV Software Communications, bought the DVD rights for distribution in North America, the United Kingdom, and Australia for \u20b970 million (US$1.1\u00a0million). This marked \"the first time an international studio has bought the video rights of an Indian film.\" Retitling it Like Stars on Earth, Disney released the film in Region\u00a02 on 26 October 2009, in Region\u00a01 on 12 January 2010, and in Region\u00a04 on 29 March 2010. A three-disc set, the Disney version features the original Hindi audio soundtrack with English subtitles or another dubbed in English, as well as bonus material such as audio commentary, deleted scenes, and the musical soundtrack. The soundtrack for Taare Zameen Par was released on 4 November 2007 under the label T-Series. The music is mainly composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, with lyrics by Prasoon Joshi. However, \"Mera Jahan\" was scored by Shailendra Barve and written by Gupte, with the latter also composing \"Ishaan's Theme.\" Joshi received the National Film Award for Best Lyrics, and Shankar Mahadevan won the National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for \"Maa.\" Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama praised the variety of genres present in the soundtrack and the lack of remixes. He gave it an overall rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, calling it a \"zero compromise album\" that \"stays true to the film's spirit\". Planet Bollywood's Atta Khan rated it 9 out of 10, noting that the soundtrack \"unquestionably lives up to all expectations\". He felt that it maintained an \"all round polished nature\" and \"is destined to become a classic\". Although he, too, enjoyed the musical variety, he believed the composers overused the guitar and synthesizers. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the soundtrack a score of 3 out of 5, commenting, \"Taare Zameen Par isn't your regular soundtrack about fluttering hearts and sleepless nights. What makes these delicate and whimsical creations special is their underlying innocence.\" .",

Saroj Khan and Bosco\u2013Caesar were the film\u2032s choreographers while the editing was done by Hemal Kothari. The principal photography began in October 2014 and the film was released on 22 May 2015. The film carries the story forward showing the next chapter of the couple's life. Tanu Weds Manu Returns received acclaim from critics and Ranaut's performance was particularly praised. Made on a budget of \u20b939 crore (US$6.0\u00a0million), the film earned \u20b9243 crore (US$38\u00a0million) worldwide and became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films. The film received three awards at the 63rd National Film Awards, including a best actress award for Ranaut.   In London, four years later in their marriage, Tanu and Manu visit a mental rehabilitation center where they start bickering at each other. Because of Tanu's various allegations, Manu gets enraged, and is later taken by the doctors into custody suspecting his mental health. Tanu's friend Payal calls her from India and tells Tanu that she gave birth to a baby girl. Being alone at city, Tanu decides to return to her hometown, Kanpur. While leaving London, Tanu rings Manu's friend Pappi in Delhi and tells him to come to London and release Manu. In Kanpur in her parents home, Tanu finds a crafty law student called Chintu has become a lodger who refuses to pay or leave. Chintu befriends Tanu and slowly develops a crush on her, being bemused by her antics. Tanu also comes to know that her ex-boyfriend, Raja Awasthi (Jimmy Shergill), is getting engaged to another girl. Pappi reaches London and gets Manu out and they reach India, where Manu sends a legal notice to Tanu to make her apologize, but she does not respond. One day Manu goes to Delhi University to give a medical speech, where he sees Kusum, a young Haryanvi student-athlete, who looks like Tanu. He slowly gets obsessed with Kusum and keeps following her despite Pappi's warning. One day after Kusum confronts them, Manu tells her about Tanu. Kusum sympathises and they gradually develop feelings for each other. Manu tells Kusum he wants to marry her and meets Omi, her elder brother. Omi has no issues with Manu but shows a picture of the boy his wife wanted Kusum to marry, who turns out to be Raja. Payal calls Tanu and confides that her newborn baby's father is not her husband Jassi. Chintu gets jealous of Raja going around with Tanu and tells her father about it. He even sends Manu a nasty legal notice for a divorce, without Tanu's consent, but Manu responds by agreeing, which shocks Tanu. She confronts Chintu who says he loves her but Raja shoves him off. Raja also discovers his engagement is being called off as Manu is going to marry the new girl in his life. Both Raja and Tanu are enraged and decide to go to Delhi to confront Manu. Manu, Kusum and Pappi travel to Chandigarh to convince Komal, Payal's sister-in-law whom Pappi loves, to run away from her wedding with Pappi instead. There Kusum is mistaken by everyone at the wedding as Tanu, including by Payal, who tells her she had a test-tube baby secretly as Jassi had azoospermia. Kusum gets frantic on hearing these secrets and gives Payal a karate chop which knocks her out. She also gives Komal a karate chop too and they smuggle her to Jhajjar, where Kusum's villagers are waiting. But once her family finds out she loves Manu, they attack Manu and Pappi and lock up Kusum. Omi arrives and saves the day with his logic. The village agrees to Kusum and Manu's marriage. As wedding preparations start Tanu and Raja reach there with Jassi, Payal, their baby and Manu's parents. Tanu makes fun of Kusum who snaps at her saying she is a state-level champion who is independent, loving and honest. She also reveals the truth behind Payal's baby in front of Jassi. A shocked and drunk Tanu meets Manu at night who brutally brushes off her love. In the morning, Tanu tells Kusum she is sorry about her behaviour and would like to stay and help at their wedding. Payal and Jassi are reunited. On the wedding evening, Tanu gets drunk and dances in front of Manu in the baraat. Her parents arrive with Chintu and are shocked to see Tanu shattered as Manu leaves for his marriage. Tanu sits quietly as Manu is marrying Kusum, until Kusum stops and confronts Manu, who confesses he still loves Tanu and cannot marry Kusum. Kusum honourably releases him and walks off, to break down privately. Tanu and Manu are joyously reunited. Kusum comes out to find drunken Chintu, delivering an angry speech. She gives him a karate chop. Following the positive response to Tanu Weds Manu post release in February 2011, the team considered making a sequel to carry the story forward showing the next chapter of the couple's life. The lead couple Madhavan and Kangana Ranaut both announced their interest of being a part of a proposed sequel, months after the original's release. In September 2011, Sunil Lulla of Eros International announced that they had signed on director Anand L. Rai to work on a second part of the film titled Tanu Weds Manu: Season 2. Early reports claimed that the lead actors would be seen in dual roles, while it was also speculated that Shahid Kapoor may replace Madhavan in the lead role. In January 2012, the project was postponed to allow Anand Rai to proceed with another venture Raanjhanaa (2013), while the makers also wanted Ranaut to finish her commitments with Krrish 3 (2013) as the sequel demanded a different look. Following the release and success of Raanjhanaa in July 2013, Anand Rai confirmed that the sequel to Tanu Weds Manu was still active and would feature the original cast in the leading roles, playing down reports that Imran Khan and Anushka Sharma were to replace them. Screenwriter Himanshu Sharma began working on the film in July 2013 and revealed that only the first ten minutes would have a London backdrop, before the story returns to Lucknow, Kanpur and Delhi. He went on to confirm the working title, though added it potentially may also be known as Tanu Weds Manu Extra Large. Pre-production continued through late 2013, with Ranaut's two-month trip to the USA delaying the start of the shoot in early 2014. She later confirmed that she would play a dual role in the film, that of an athlete apart from Tanu, and the team scouted for a body double to be used in scenes featuring both characters. Dhanush, who had worked in Raanjhanaa, was revealed to be playing a cameo appearance in the film. The team began filming in October 2014 in Lucknow, after a small launch ceremony. The first motion poster of the film was released on 23 March 2015 on the birthday of the leading actress, Kangana Ranaut at a special event in Delhi. \"Ja Ja Ja Ja Bewafa\" sung by Geeta Dutt in 1954 film Aar Paar, was picturized on Ranaut, playing the background. In May 2014, the producers of the original film, Sanjay Singh, Vinod Bachchan and Shailesh Singh filed a legal notice stating that the director did not have the rights to make a sequel without their permission. Anand Rai replied stating that the trio only had rights over the first film and no direct rights over sequels or the franchise. In a further reply, Bachchan revealed that they were interested in making a sequel and should have been approached ahead of Eros International. In May 2015, a critic at the Mumbai Mirror gave the film 2.5 stars and a generally negative review. The newspaper later \"revised\" the critic's rating to 3.5 stars, based on reader feedback. The music and background score is composed by Krsna Solo, and the lyrics were written by Rajshekhar. However, the song \"Banno\" has been composed by Tanishk Bagchi and Vayu, and written by Vayu, and the song \"Mari Gali\" has been written by N.S. Chauhan and SurjRDB, and composed by the latter. The film was released worldwide on 22 May 2015 with nearly 2200 screens in India. The film was released overseas with 350 screens across the United States of America, United Kingdom, Canada, Pakistan, New Zealand, Australia and UAE. According to Box Office India, the film had an average opening in circuits like Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. Tanu Weds Manu Returns opened to almost 60% occupancies in screens up north, while screens across other states and metros had registered figures of 40\u201350%. The satellite rights of the film were sold to Zee TV. Tanu Weds Manu Returns received positive reviews from critics, with special praise directed to Ranaut's performance. In a 4.5 out of 5 star review, Srijan Mitra Das of The Times Of India said, \"Tanu Weds Manu Returns boasts one of the finest double roles ever in Hindi cinema. Alongside, Madhavan does a fine job as quiet, often morose, sometimes hopeful Manu.\" He also added, \"Anand L. Rai merits applause for his masterful direction of Himanshu Sharma's rich, riotous story. Evoking a new-age Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Rai keeps things tight, light, yet layered.\"  Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote, \"I would buy a ticket for Kangana Ranaut.\" She gave the film 3 out of 5 stars. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV said, \"The film hits the ground running, cruises along like a song until its final moments, where it comes close to losing its way just a tad.\" Mihir Fadnavis of Firstpost praised Kangana's performance saying \"...the real draw of Tanu Weds Manu Returns is that you get two Kangana Ranauts to entertain you and she delivers in a huge way.\" Tanu Weds Manu Returns earned \u20b9380 million (US$5.9\u00a0million) in its opening weekend in India, for a worldwide gross of \u20b9650 million (US$10\u00a0million). Trade analysts reported that the film took in the biggest opening weekend collections for a Bollywood film that year, and also recovered its production budget in the first three days. The film earned \u20b985 million (US$1.3\u00a0million) on its first Monday. It earned \u20b9975 million (US$15\u00a0million) after its second weekend. The film earned \u20b9457.5 million (US$7.1\u00a0million) in its second week in India for a two-week domestic total of \u20b91.15 billion (US$18\u00a0million). According to Box Office India projection, Tanu Weds Manu Returns earned \u20b9243 crore (US$38\u00a0million) worldwide at the end of its theatrical run, to become one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films.",

Filmed mostly in black and white, with some colour scenes, the movie tells the story of a poet who falls in love with three different women. It is inspired by writer D.H. Lawrence's works. The music was composed by S. D. Burman, whose son Rahul Dev Burman composed the English version of this film titled \"Oh Boy and Three Girls\" but the print was never released.   Teen Deviaan starts off to commentary by Ameen Sayani, as the camera moves through Calcutta's streets, the pretty Nanda (Nanda) finds herself, as she sees it, being followed. The man, Dev Dutt Anand (Dev Anand) has been sitting in the bus beside her, and has bought a ticket for Dalhousie (after she\u2019s bought one) and has now even followed her into the boarding house where she lives. At this point, Nanda loses her temper and yells at Dev, threatening to call the police. Instead, her shouting attracts the attention of the boarding house\u2019s owners, Mr Pinto (Harindranath Chattopadhyay) and his wife (Ruby Myers). Mr. and Mrs. Pinto assure Nanda that she\u2019s misunderstood, this Dev being their new lodger. Nanda is sheepish and embarrassed. But Dev forgives her readily with a remark quite apparently aimed at her, though he\u2019s in his room and she\u2019s in hers, watching each other only through a gap. Within a couple of days, they\u2019re good friends. In fact, Nanda is pretty much in love with Dev. He flirts with her, is sweet to him, even goes off on a day trip into the countryside with her. Meanwhile, Dev starts working at Merry Musical Stores. His boss, I.S. Johar (I S Johar) flies off the handle when Dev turns up late on the very first day. But one day, I.S. Johar happens to come across a poem that Dev\u2019s written and is so impressed that he quickly forgives Dev and all his shortcomings and prays that Dev\u2019s poems will soon get published. Hopefully some of Dev\u2019s subsequent fame will rub off onto Merry Musical Stores too. One evening, Dev\u2019s sitting on a bench in a park when a passing car goes hurtling through a puddle, and Dev is liberally splashed. He calls out to the driver Kalpana (Kalpana) that something\u2019s fallen off her car. Curious, she reverses, then gets out of the car to have a look around. This giving Dev an opportunity to have his revenge for the drenching he received. He\u2019s been fiddling with a hosepipe all this while, and now turns it on her, leaving her wet and furious.Even worse, when she gets into her car and tries to start it, it won\u2019t start. Soon, a bunch of stragglers gather around. Instead of helping her, they spend all their time ogling her and passing comments. Finally, Dev takes pity on her and offers to attend to her car; the engine kicks in immediately, and Dev takes it upon himself to drive her to back home. She makes it quite clear that she doesn\u2019t want his help, but Dev insists, and leaves her with no option but to agree. By the time he reaches her house \u2013 having draped his coat over her wet and shivering shoulders \u2013 this mysterious lady is rather more kindly disposed towards Dev, though she doesn\u2019t show it. However, when he\u2019s gone and she\u2019s changing her wet clothes, she looks fondly down at his coat and sees his notebook of poems sticking out of the pocket. She has a look through it. Next day, I.S. Johar has a piece of very good news to share with Dev his book of poems has been accepted by a publisher and the first proof copies have arrived. I.S. Johar sends out copies to some of Merry Musical Stores\u2019 clients. One of these is the wealthy and influential socialite Radharani \u2018Simi\u2019 (Simi Garewal). Simi receives a copy of Dev\u2019s book of poems and is completely bowled over by them. Dev happens to come to her home to deliver a piano and tune it for her while she\u2019s reading his book, and Dev owns up to being the poet. Then, a couple of days later, a lady resurfaces in Dev\u2019s life: the unknown woman to whom he had lent his coat. It turns out that this woman is Kalpana (Kalpana), and she\u2019s a famous actress. Her life is a whirl of men trying to flatter her, making promises of laying their hearts at her feet, and so on. Dev\u2019s failure to even recognize her has endeared him to her. She likes his candour, and the fact that he treats her as a friend, not as an idol. She even buys him a new coat, which she hands over to him in the car, insisting that he should wear it in exchange for his old coat. And that isn\u2019t the only time they meet. One day, Kalpana wheedles Dev into accompanying her for a shoot in the countryside. They have a minor mishap along the way, the car goes into a ditch, and Dev and Kalpana spend an interesting day getting to know the locals. Few days later, Simi had an invitation to a party at her home. Dev is reluctant to go, but I.S. Johar persuades him. Simi is vastly influential; she knows everybody worth knowing. She can give his writing career the boost it needs. Dev must go and so he does. He is an instant success. And he manages to convince both Simi and Kalpana that he is singing for her. At party Dev gets drunk so much that Simi has to drop him to his boarding house. Nanda notices Dev and helps him upstairs to his apartment. Next morning, Nanda gets angry with Dev about his drunken act the earlier night. Dev apologizes and takes Nanda to the countryside where Nanda proposes Dev to marry her. Dev asks her to wait till the right time comes. One evening genteel Simi who is eager to spend money on Dev, to further enhance his career convinces Dev to participate in a Mushaira at Srinagar which is to be aired on All India Radio. After a few days they reach Srinagar to participate in the mushaira where Dev performs perfectly. Later at night when both of them are sitting in Shikara at Dal Lake, Simi asks Dev to come to Gulmarg. There she proposes Dev to marry her but Dev asks her to give 4 to 7 days to answer. On returning from Gulmarg, at the hotel in Srinager, Dev finds Kalpana with sadness in her eyes, which he correctly guesses to be loneliness. Kalpana admits it to him, that, she has seen the superficiality of the life that surrounds her, and she longs for someone to truly understand her, as a person, not just a beautiful face. Even here, Dev asks her to give 4 to 7 days to answer. Returning from Srinagar, Dev is in a lot of confusion about the three ladies, Teen Devian, and knowing well that he cannot marry three women in his country, a tortured and uncertain Dev finally makes his mind and decides to go with Nanda as his life-partner. Teen Devian was one of the films featured in Avijit Ghosh's book, 40 Retakes: Bollywood Classics You May Have Missed",

Nasir Hussain produced and wrote the film under his home banner. He approached Dev Anand to star in Teesri Manzil and he immediately agreed. However, at the same time, another of Nasir Hussain's production Baharon Ke Sapne was to be directed by Vijay Anand. However, on occasion of Sadhana's engagement party, a misunderstanding erupted between Devanand and Nasir Hussain, when apparently, Nasir overheard Dev Anand saying \"The film which Nasir is making with me is coloured and he has given Goldie some black-and-white film to make. Goldie is making the movie with some new boy, Rajesh Khanna\". It was then next day that Nasir requested Vijay Anand to direct \"Teezri Manzil\" and offered to helm \"Baharon Ke Sapne\" but specified that Teesri Manzil would not have Devanand in it. It was only then that Shammi Kapoor was approached. Vijay came on board to direct and edit the film. Hussain then cast Shammi Kapoor who had earlier starred in Hussain's two big hits, Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957) and Dil Deke Dekho, which introduced Asha Parekh. Asha had starred in two more hits for Hussain Jab Pyar Kisise Hota Hai (1961) and Phir Wohi Dil Laya Hoon (1963). Thus, the newcomer for this film would be music composer R.D. Burman (son of music composer S.D. Burman), and he would create phenomenal music for this film. He would compose for all of Hussain's films until Zabardast(1985). Shammi Kapoor, Hussain, and Vijay individually took credit for discovering the supremely talented R.D. Burman. But R.D. Burman gave credit to lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri for recommending him to Hussain, and both of them would create unforgettable songs for Teesri Manzil. All the hit songs featured the excellent Mohammed Rafi The song picturization were outstanding, with Helen dancing to \"Oh Haseena zulfon waali\". Songs like \"Aaja aaja\" had a rock n' roll base and were extremely popular. All the songs were composed by Rahul Dev Burman and lyrics were penned by Majrooh Sultanpuri. The excellent Mohammed Rafi featured in all the songs. Choreography was by Herman Benjamin. The film became a hit and remains popular to this day. Although it is a murder mystery, it continues to draw repeat audiences even though the identity of the murderer is no longer a secret. Teesri Manzil was the last time Shammi starred in a Nasir Hussain film. Asha would go on to do four more, three of which she starred in. Teesri Manzil was also the last Hussain film in which Mohammed Rafi sang all the songs. By Yaadon Ki Baraat, Kishore Kumar had temporarily become the dominant singer in Hussain's movies, but Rafi always had a special place in Hussain's films and would later win major awards for the song \"Kya hua tera wada\" in Hussain's Hum Kisise Kum Naheen (1977). Hussain and Vijay never worked together after Teesri Manzil. Hussain would return to directing all his films again and would only relinquish the director's chair to his son after three of his films flopped in the 1980s. Salim Khan played a small role as Shammi Kapoor's musician friend who pretends to be Rocky in the musical number \"Oh Haseena zulfon waali\". In real life, Helen would later become his second wife. Shammi's wife Geeta Bali died during the filming, and Vijay helped Shammi get over the grief.",

        "full_text": " The Dirty Picture is a 2011 Indian biographical musical drama film inspired by the life of Silk Smitha, a South Indian actress noted for her erotic roles. The filmmakers have clarified that the story is not officially or literally based on Smitha alone, but on many of her southern contemporaries such as Disco Shanti. It also resembles the personal lives of other women in popular culture, including Hollywood actress and sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. The film was directed by Milan Luthria and co-produced by Shobha Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor, after Ekta came up with the idea and asked screenwriter Rajat Aroraa to pen a story based on it. Produced on a budget of \u20b9180 million (US$2.8\u00a0million), The Dirty Picture was released worldwide on 2 December 2011 (the anniversary of Smitha's birth), in Hindi, Telugu and Tamil versions. Vidya Balan, Naseeruddin Shah, Tusshar Kapoor and Emraan Hashmi played lead roles. Upon release it was a critical and commercial success, with Balan receiving the highest accolades for her performance; she was called \"the hero of the film\". In addition, the film has received widespread praise for portraying women as powerful, contributing something unique to a typically male-dominated society. The music was composed by Vishal Shekhar with lyrics written by Rajat Aroraa. The Dirty Picture grossed \u20b91.14 billion (US$18\u00a0million) worldwide and received several awards, most of which were won by Balan for her portrayal of Silk. It won three National Film Awards including Best Actress, three Filmfare Awards and six Screen Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. Box Office India declared the film a 'Blockbuster' after its fourth week.   A day before her marriage, Reshma (Vidya Balan) runs away from her rural village, hoping to become a star in Chennai. She fails to impress a casting director, and he insults her for being unattractive and unable to act. Determined to secure a role, she spontaneously auditions for the position of a background dancer. However, she dances in a sultry manner, using erotic movements which annoys the film's director, Abraham (Emraan Hashmi). He edits out Reshma's entire dance sequence. The film fails at the box office, much to the dismay of the producer Selva Ganesh (Rajesh Sharma), who later recalls Reshma's performance and offers her a role in a song in his upcoming film. Selva also suggests that she now be referred to as \"Silk\", which is more exotic and captivating. At the first shoot, Silk dances with veteran actor Suryakanth (Naseeruddin Shah), her childhood idol. Enamoured with him, Silk gains his affection and attention by offering a long-term sexual relationship. Meanwhile, Abraham proposes a new film to Selva Ganesh and is keen to cast Suryakanth. However, Suryakanth's suggestion of adding sex and eroticism, to make the film more commercially viable, angers Abraham. Silk slowly builds a name for herself in the industry and goes on to do many more sexually charged films with Suryakanth, which catapults her into stardom. She gains many male fans and, in a short time, becomes immensely rich and popular as a Southern sex symbol. Suryakanth's younger brother Ramakanth (Tusshar Kapoor) is an admirer of Silk and starts to befriend her. Silk develops a liking for him, after she realizes that he is the first man who loves her for more than just her body and sex appeal. At an awards ceremony Silk is praised for her performance but is insulted by Suryakanth who tells her that she is nothing more than everyone's \"dirty secret\". Hurt by his remarks, Silk announces that she will continue to make her \"dirty pictures\" and that she has no qualms in doing so. She begins to spend more time with Ramakanth and becomes the focus of tabloid gossip after noted journalist Naila (Anju Mahendru) criticises Silk for having a romantic relationship with both brothers. To avoid scandal, and also to get revenge, Suryakanth drops Silk from his forthcoming films, forcing her to work with smaller, unknown filmmakers. She loses interest in her work and begins to feel threatened by a younger aspiring actress, Shakeela. During a dance challenge she intentionally trips Shakeela, much to the embarrassment of Ramakanth who then decides to end their relationship. To ease her heartbreak and the rejection from her family, Silk turns to alcohol and chain smoking. She gains weight, causing her to lose her status as a sex symbol. Silk approaches Silva Ganesh with an offer to produce a film together. Ultimately, the audience and industry has lost interest in her, and the film fails. On the other hand, Abraham directs a film which turns out to be a huge hit, and he feels that he has finally proven to Silk (and himself) that his films do not need any sexualisation to be successful. Having lost her fame and fortune, Silk has accumulated so much debt that she approaches a small-time filmmaker, willing to take on any role. She is shocked to find that he wants her to do a pornographic film, and she refuses. He intoxicates her with alcohol and starts filming, without her permission. The place is raided by the police but Silk manages to escape. Abraham finds himself falling in love with Silk, even though he denies it first, as he struggles with this moral dilemma. During a phone conversation with Silk, Abraham becomes alarmed when she asks him to bid farewell to everyone for her. He rushes to her house, and finds her lying in bed dead from a sleeping pill overdose, along with a suicide note. The film ends with Abraham's narration, examining the life that Silk has led, and he questions whether the consequences she faced from her actions were justified or not. He concludes by realizing that we will never know if her way of life was right or wrong, or if we should judge her at all. Ekta Kapoor launched the film with director Milan Luthria soon after their collaboration Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai became a hit. She said that The Dirty Picture would be India's answer to the Academy Award nominated film Boogie Nights. Later in a press conference, Kapoor clarified that neither of Balaji's forthcoming films, Ragini MMS nor The Dirty Picture, were \"porn films\" as they had been made out to be. Kapoor has gone on record to add, \"I would be surprised if I don't get unbelievable critical acclaim for The Dirty Picture and a national award for my actress, Vidya Balan. The film has one of the most well-written scripts I have come across and a lot of youngsters in my office have looked at it with great admiration.\" She pointed out that the purpose of the film was neither to justify nor criticise Smitha's life but for the audience to live her life. Additionally, all actors, including Balan and Shah attended workshops for almost two months before filming began, to familiarise themselves with the body language of their characters. When screenwriter Rajat Aroraa initially started working, taking cues from producer Kapoor, the scope of the film was much smaller, primarily looking back to the soft-pornography scene of the 1980s. As work progressed, the scope gradually widened to include the controversial romances of Smitha through a fictionalised biopic. While researching for the film, director Luthria and screenwriter Aroraa found little material in magazines of that period, as \"women like Silk Smitha were often ignored by film magazines, except for gossip column mentions\". Thus they derived many of the details of her life from anecdotes and party gossips, and then fictionalised them. Apart from depicting the pomp of the Telugu/Tamil film industry, the screenplay takes up issues such as money management by actors, \"their string of broken relationships\", and the way they \"led lonely lives and met with tragic ends\". For inspiration, instead of looking at South Indian films of the period, the team turned to the work of mainstream Bollywood directors like Manmohan Desai, Vijay Anand, Raj Kapoor, Feroz Khan and G.P. Sippy. To put the global soft-porn industry in context, the team looked into Boogie Nights (1997) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996). The final script became a \"fictionalised, women-oriented, generalised perspective on the 1980s film industry\". After initial talks with actresses Kangana Ranaut and Bipasha Basu fell through, Vidya Balan was offered the lead role. When Balan was narrated the script and shown sketches of what she needed to wear for the portrayal, she felt uncomfortable. Luthria added, \"We couldn't have found anyone better than Vidya for this role. It's a casting that very few would think is viable because it is going to be nothing like Vidya has done before. But I am confident she will push the envelope as far as she can\". Regarding the criticism that Balan's character might evoke, Luthria clarified, \"I wanted Vidya to know that what she's doing is not crass or crude but can be shown aesthetically in a sensual manner with a touch of class. What her character does, is not cheap.\" As a reference point, he also asked Balan to study 'similar themed' films such as Burlesque and Chicago. Balan also underwent salsa training to fine-tune herself with Smitha's languid body language. Next, Naseeruddin Shah was cast as an ageing South Indian superstar with \"hideous wigs, dark glasses and painted-on mustaches\". He performed a \"fast dance number\" in the film, a full 22 years after he last did it in the song \"Tirchi Topiwale\" from Tridev (1989). Regarding his character, Ekta Kapoor stated, \"This role requires him to play to the gallery, provoke claps, laughs, and whistles and I know he can pull it off because Naseer is the Shah of all actors.\" Luthria added, \"Expect a man who unabashedly enjoys the flesh of women\". Tusshar Kapoor and Emraan Hashmi were next cast in lead roles. While it was known that Tusshar Kapoor would play the role of a script-writer and Smitha's love interest, the nature of Hashmi's role was unknown for a while. The casting received praise from trade pundits, with Taran Adarsh commenting, \"Known for engaging in interesting and unconventional casting in all its previous releases, Balaji has again tackled the unheard of, by casting Emraan Hashmi and Vidya Balan\u00a0\u2013 two of the most successful stars of today\u00a0\u2013 opposite each other in The Dirty Picture. The perfect combination of mass and class promises to make this controversial film yet another winner from the Balaji stable.\" Filming was to begin on 21 May 2011: a week after the release of Kapoor's Ragini MMS. But due to production delays, it began a week later. Balan, a religious person, organised a puja on the sets before principal photography began. The first leg of filming took place at Mumbai's Film City where an elaborate set re-creating Chennai (then Madras) of the 80s was set up. The second schedule was shot in Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. The song \"Ishq Sufiyana\" was shot at Bidar fort in Bidar, Karnataka. Filming was completed in September, before venturing into post-production, ahead of the December release. Director Luthria wanted to depict a sense of discomfort between the two lead characters, Balan and Hashmi, a \"meeting of two completely different worlds\". So he didn't allow them to interact and get comfortable with each other during film workshops ahead of the shoot. Since he considered them \"the unlikeliest pair to come together\", he brought them together right into the shoot filming an important scene, where they had to insult each other. Though he was initially anxious, it all turned out well and he was surprised by the resulting chemistry. The first look of The Dirty Picture and a short teaser were launched online on 26 August 2011. The enthusiastic response even prompted its producers to consider a sequel. The film's trailer on YouTube got over 500,000 hits in one day and one million hits in two days. Meanwhile, the theatrical trailer was launched on 30 August at a single screen cinema in Bandra. The space was especially decorated to recreate the retro era. Since the film is set in the 1980s, a time when multiplexes did not exist, the producers thought it would be fitting to show the premi\u00e8re on a single screen. The lead stars created publicity by organising a promotional campaign in the festival of Mithibai College on 30 November. As a part of the film promotion, actors Vidya Balan, Tusshar Kapoor and Emraan Hashmi made appearances on the popular TV show Bigg Boss aired on Colors on 26 November 2011. Balan also entered the house to spend some time with the housemates and present a red sari to Sunny Leone, as a present. On 27 November 2011, Balan and Hashmi made guest appearances on a special one-hour episode of Sony Entertainment Television India's popular daily soap Bade Achhe Lagte Hain. Balan shook leg to the song, \"Ooh La La\" with Saakshi Tanwar, the female lead actress of the soap. T-Series acquired the music rights for The Dirty Picture. Vishal-Shekhar composed four tracks and Rajat Arora penned the lyrics for them. The first of the four tracks, \"Ooh La La,\" sung by Bappi Lahiri was released on the internet on 19 October 2011. Track list Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gave the music an overall rating of 4 out of five saying, \"Music of The Dirty Picture takes the expected route and delivers what it promised\" and chose Ooh La La and Ishq Sufiyana as picks from the album. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the album a rating of 2 and a half out of 5, and said the opening track of The Dirty Picture is the album's only star. The film released worldwide on 2 December 2011, coinciding with the 51st birth anniversary of South Indian film siren Silk Smitha. Nationally, the film released on 1766 screens and on 120 screens abroad. The satellite rights were sold to Sony Entertainment Television for \u20b980 million (US$1.2\u00a0million) and another \u20b920 million (US$310,000) from music rights deal with T-Series. Raveena Tandon's husband, Anil Thadani acquired the distributor rights for \u20b9191 million (US$3.0\u00a0million). Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. The Times of India gave 4 out of 5 stars, concluding that \"The Dirty Picture is definitely not only your film for the week, but is a seminal work that will be studied in feminist discourses.\" Komal Nahta of Koimoi.com gave 4 out of 5 stars and said, \"The Dirty Picture is a wonderful film and will do extraordinary business.\" Kaveree Bamzai of India Today gave 4 out of 5 stars and extolled Balan's performance, calling it \"riveting\". Dainik Bhaskar gave the film 3 and half stars out of 5, concluding, \"Overall, a big thumbs up to The Dirty Picture, which is in its truest meaning, an entertainer. Highly recommended!\" Raja Sen from Rediff.com gave 3.5 out of 5 stars and said \"The Dirty Picture forsakes much potential nuance in its urge to please crowds but is still far more engaging than most Bollywood produce.\" Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave 3 out of 5 stars, highlighting that \"In terms of creativity, it's a middling effort. But where bravado is concerned, The Dirty Picture kicks ass by virtue of three very strong reasons: Vidya Balan. Vidya Balan. Vidya Balan.\" Kunal Guha of Yahoo! India gave the movie 3 stars out of 5, and said, \"Clearly, Rajat Aroraa's winning dialogues will make you sit up and say, \"She [Balan] didn't just say that?!\" The Dirty Picture opened strong, with 60\u201365% collections on average at multiplexes and had the 5th biggest opening of 2011.

The film was conceived as a star vehicle for its heroine Ameeta, who was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Filmistan Studios owner Tolaram Jalan. Much care was taken with her make-up, wardrobe and lighting. Much of the film's extensive publicity was also built around the actress. Ironically, the film's huge success at the box office, made the then-struggling Shammi Kapoor, an overnight sensation instead. This was the film where he developed his own individual look and youthful style and was his first light-hearted musical and its success helped move him to acting in this genre. The film also stars the popular villain and character actor Pran. Its music is by O.P. Nayyar and lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri. The film was originally offered to Dev Anand but he declined due to which Amita and Shammi Kapoor came in his place.

It is loosely based on and revolves around the drug abuse by the youth population in the Indian state of Punjab and the various conspiracies surrounding it. Produced by Shobha Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor under their banner Balaji Motion Pictures, in association with Anurag Kashyap's production house Phantom Films, it features an ensemble cast consisting of Shahid Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and, Diljit Dosanjh. On 4 June 2016, the Central Board of Film Certification sought a stay on the film's release citing that the themes dealt with in the film were too vulgar for the general audience. As a result, the producers were directed to make a total of 89 cuts in the film. However, on 13 June 2016, the Bombay High Court struck down the stay and gave permission for the film's national release, albeit with a single cut in the screenplay. The film was released worldwide on 17 June 2016. Made on a budget of \u20b9400 million (US$6.2\u00a0million), Udta Punjab has earned approximately \u20b9997 million (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide. At the 62nd Filmfare Awards, the film won four awards, including Best Actress (Alia Bhatt) and Critics Award for Best Actor (Shahid Kapoor).   Tejinder \"Tommy\" Singh (Shahid Kapoor), also known as \"Gabru\" among his fans, is a young Punjabi musician who lives a luxurious lifestyle assisted by his successful music career. Together with ostentatious crew that is led by Tayaji (Satish Kaushik) and cousin Jassi (Suhail Nayyar), he indulges in uncontrolled consumption of cocaine. Tommy, is popular for his adrenaline-pumping songs that both were written with the help of and are about intoxication. Though, Tommy has no qualms about his songs glorifying violence and drug-addiction. However, his frequent bouts of drug-snorting cost him his contract and lands him in jail. In prison, he meets two of his die-hard fans who remark how Tommy's lifestyle had 'inspired' theirs. Realizing that his songs have adversely and negatively affected teenagers, Tommy decides to change his ways upon release. A few days later, Tommy engages in an altercation with Tayaji and accidentally shoots him, injuring his ear. This causes Tayaji to send Tommy and his crew to a farmhouse so that he can prepare for an upcoming concert. Working on a farm is an unnamed Bihari migrant (Alia Bhatt), frequently called Bauria by a co-worker in the fields, whose dreams of playing national level hockey for the country were shattered so she came to Punjab to work as a labourer. Bauria works as a farmworker for a local landlord who uses agriculture as a front for drug peddling. One night, while roaming around in the farm, she finds a packet. Upon tearing open its contents and tasting it, she realizes that it is some kind of drug, and hence, resolves to sell it. Her search for a potential buyer lands her in great trouble as she is chased and captured by a gang of drug peddlers. They forcibly keep Bauria at their place where she is sexually and physically abused, given drugs and prostituted to several men including police officers from the local police force. Some weeks later, Bauria manages to escape from the house. In this neighboring town also lives Preet Sahni (Kareena Kapoor), a doctor and activist who runs a rehabilitation center. Sartaj Singh (Diljit Dosanjh) is a class-two policeman attached to the town's station who knows about the smuggling of drugs his seniors are allowing on a large scale. But when it affects his family, his brother, Balli (Prabhjyot Singh), overdoses on Chaand (a locally-made drug) and is brought to Preet's clinic, he realizes the grave situation. She educates Sartaj about the drug problem and partly accuses him for his brother's state. Together, they decide to find the root cause of the problem. Appearing before his audience in the concert, instead of singing, Tommy starts preaching. Infuriated by his speech about how one should lead his/her life, his fans try to admonish him, and start throwing bottles at him. Tommy gets angry and urinates in front of the crowd. Making a run out of the concert to save himself from the crowd's angst, Tommy goes and hides inside a dilapidated structure. There he meets Bauria and together they start sharing their stories. However, the next day, Bauria is recaptured by the same gang who had kept her imprisoned. Tommy sets out to find her after realising his true feelings for her. Preet has been working in Punjab actively with drug abuse survivors and their families. She runs her own clinic in the area where she operates a residential rehab center. With help from a reformed Sartaj who discovers that his own brother is hooked to a locally-made drug, manages to find that the antagonist behind the drug problem in Punjab is an elderly man called Vikrant who has flourished with the support of MP Maninder Brar. Sartaj and Preeti go to extreme measures to collect evidence against the Parliamentarian and put together a report to be sent to the state's Election Commission to thwart Brar's campaign for another term in power. Sartaj develops feelings for her and asks her out which she reciprocates willingly. However, one night, after returning from work, she is apprehended and fatally stabbed by Balli, who was being treated against his wish at her rehab center. The policemen who come to investigate her murder also come across her report. In the presence of the drug mafia, Sartaj is questioned by his senior about the report. At the same time, Tommy, who is on the run from the police and has been searching for Bauria, jumps and enters the enclosure, alerting everyone including Vikrant and the senior policeman. He fatally hits Vikrant with his hockey stick and tries to make a move upstairs. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Sartaj grabs his senior's service revolver and shoots everyone but Tommy. He then rushes inside the house to get his brother Balli, who is being held captive by Vikrant's wife. He shoots her and frees Balli, while Tommy goes upstairs and helps Bauria beat her captors. Finally, as Tommy and Bauria run off, Balli kneels down and cries in front of his brother whose face is expressionless. Later Tommy calls Bauria on his crew member's phone to ask her real name. Sitting by a beach, she catches sight of a foreigner having fun. Inspired, she utters \"Mary Jane\".[a] Priyanka Chopra was initially approached for the lead female role. Later Parineeti Chopra was in talks for the same part.Principal photography of the film commenced in March 2015, Three of the actors Shahid Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor and Alia Bhatt halved their fees for the film. The music for Udta Punjab was composed by Amit Trivedi with lyrics by the late Shiv Kumar Batalvi, Shellee and Varun Grover. The background music was composed by Benedict Taylor & Naren Chandavarkar. The music rights are acquired by Zee Music Company. The first song \"Chitta Ve\" was released on 4 May 2016. Two more Singles \"Da Da Dasse\" and \"Ik Kudi\" were released before the Release of Final soundtrack. The Complete Soundtrack consisting of 7 songs was released on 18 May 2016. All music composed by Amit Trivedi. Amit Trivedi said about the soundtrack, \"The film required a really dark soundtrack. So, I had to incorporate psychedelic trance and hip hop into it. It will be edgier and more in-your-face than anything else seen in Bollywood music before. I don't know how the audience will react to it because it is not something that we are used to. But I do know that there are people who have an appetite for psy-trance and hip hop in India. So, I hope it is received well\". The movie's music rights were sold for \u20b918 crore (US$2.8\u00a0million), making it the biggest such deal in Bollywood history. The movie has been reported to have had issues with the censor board over profanities and scenes of drug use. On 9 June 2016, the Censor Board (CBFC) came out with a list of 94 cuts and 13 pointers prior to the film's release. One of the pointers even included deleting the names of cities in Punjab. On 13 June 2016, Bombay High Court cleared Udta Punjab with one cut and disclaimers. The scene where Tommy Singh (Shahid Kapoor) is shown urinating on a crowd needs to be chopped off, ruled the court. The CBFC was directed to issue an 'A' certificate to Udta Punjab within two days. The row over the film being drug-themed slated for release on 17 June escalated with co-producer Anurag Kashyap hitting out at CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani, calling him \"oligarch\" and \"dictator\" and that it was like living in North Korea. The makers of the film are said to have been asked by the Revising Committee of the Censor Board to remove all references to Punjab and to make 89 cuts. Kashyap got the support of several filmmakers including Karan Johar, Mahesh Bhatt, Ram Gopal Varma, Aamir Khan, Imtiaz Ali, Varun Dhawan and Mukesh Bhatt. \"It is a dark day for freedom of expression and creativity in the country,\" Mukesh Bhatt said, calling Pahlaj Nihalani a \"stooge\" of the government. It was later cleared by Bombay High Court with the number of cuts reduced from 89 to a single scene, wherein a character is seen urinating on a crowd of people. The Court directed the Board to issue an 'A' certificate before the scheduled release of the movie. According to The Economist, Nihalani \"was appointed by the BJP, whose coalition partner in Punjab, the SAD, had much to lose from bad publicity\" resulting from the movie, due to a subplot in the movie drawing \"a parallel with the real-life case of a convicted drug lord who named the SAD deputy chief\u2019s brother-in-law as his accomplice\". On 15 June 2016, some parts of the film were leaked online onto various peer-to-peer sharing websites. While some torrent sites hosted torrent files containing a forty-minute clip, the whole film was also uploaded on other media sharing sites like Mega. Indiatimes.com reported that the leaked clips allegedly contained the text \"FOR CENSOR\" on the top-left corner, implying that the leaked copies were part of the samples shared with the Censor Board. The Huffington Post reported that the producers of the film had filed a complaint with the Cyber Crime cell in Mumbai. It added that Balaji Motion Pictures and Phantom Films, its producers, had succeeded in pulling down as many as 600 links from the web. Commenting on the leak, the film's spokesperson said, \"Two copies of the CD were sent to the CBFC and this version is from the same source. It's literally a no-brainer to conclude where the leak has come from and, sure enough, the cyber crime cell will get to the bottom of this.\" Meena Iyer of The Times of India gave the film 4.5 stars out of 5. Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 writes \"the film is hard-hitting and uncomfortable to watch, and mixes dark humor to a tale about the dirty drug and political nexus in Punjab\", giving it 3.5 rating out of 5. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film 3 stars out of 5, saying it is \"the kind of film which has something to say, and it says it with both flair and conviction\". Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the film 4 stars out of 5, saying \"Udta Punjab is a wake-up call, an important film and a mighty impressive one at that, carrying a loud anti-drug message\". Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times wrote \"Udta Punjab works mostly because of its tone and stand against drugs, though the second half is no match for the first\", giving the film 3.5 rating out of 5. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film 4 stars out of 5, writing \"Udta Punjab is littered with standout scenes, but none matches the sledgehammer impact of the climax\". Namrata Joshi of The Hindu described the film as \"a gut-wrenching look at the frightening dystopia that is Punjab today owing to rampant drug abuse\". The film earned approximately \u20b910.05 crore (US$1.6\u00a0million) in India, with an additional \u20b93.46 crore (US$540,000) coming from overseas revenue on its opening day. The film grossed \u20b946.94 crore (US$7.3\u00a0million) worldwide during its opening weekend and \u20b975.82 crore (US$12\u00a0million) worldwide in its first week. As of 9 July 2016[update], the film has earned \u20b999.70 crore (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide.",

Based on the 1905 Urdu novel Umrao Jaan Ada, the film tells the story of a Lucknow courtesan and her rise to fame.   In the year 1840, a girl named Amiran is kidnapped from her family in Faizabad and sold to Khanum Jaan, the madam of a brothel in Lucknow who teaches young courtesans. Renamed Umrao Jaan, Amiran turns into a cultured woman trained to captivate men of wealth and taste. Umrao catches the eye of Nawab Sultan and the two fall in love, but the relationship comes to an end when Nawab reveals he must marry in order to please his family. Umrao then becomes infatuated with bandit chieftain Faiz Ali, who woos and wins her heart. She elopes with him, but is forced to return to Lucknow after Ali is killed by local police. Sometime later, British soldiers attack Lucknow and the residents are forced to flee. Umrao's party of refugees stops in a small village, which Umrao recognizes as Faizabad. The residents fail to recognize her, however, and ask her to dance for their pleasure. Afterwards, she reunites with her family, who believed her to be dead. Her mother is happy to welcome Umrao back, but her brother forbids it and orders Umrao to never return. She returns to Lucknow to find the brothel looted and deserted. Rekha was praised for her acting, but the box office returns were just average. The supporting characters were played by Naseeruddin Shah, Farooq Shaikh, Raj Babbar and Bharat Bhushan. Critics responded favourably to the carefully done historical setting. The soundtrack was composed by Khayyam and the lyrics were penned by Shahryar. Several songs from the film, sung by Asha Bhosle, are considered classics of filmi music: \"Dil cheez kya hai\", \"Justuju Jiski Thi\", \"In ankhon ki masti\", and \"Yeh kya jagah hai doston\". A remake of Umrao Jaan was released on 3 November 2006. It is directed by J.P. Dutta and stars Aishwarya Rai as Umrao Jaan, Sunil Shetty as Faiz Ali, Puru Raaj Kumar as Gauhar Mirza and Abhishek Bachchan as Nawab Sultan.

Manoj Kumar started his Mr. Bharat persona and his brand of patriotism & fearless courage with this film.   Manoj Kumar played a village man 'Bharat', who sacrifices everything to get his brother educated. His brother Puran (Prem Chopra) goes abroad and comes back a selfish man wanting his share of the property. But when India starts a war with Pakistan, Bharat decides to enlist and head to the border; while his selfish brother, with the help of his greedy uncle, Charandas(Madan Puri) and some partners, tries to gain profit by selling drugs and black marketeering in the market. In the end, Bharat returns as a demoralized soldier having lost the war and his brother repents as he is caught by the police (by the brother-in-law of Bharat). Hence, he vows to be a good & hardworking brother just like his Indo-Pak war veteran brother Bharat. The movie also stars Asha Parekh as a doctor promoting family planning, Kamini Kaushal and Pran in his first positive character role. Madan Puri played the main villain with ease, full ability, and command. The film won several major awards. Many years later, Manoj Kumar said that one of the most beautiful screen images that stuck in his mind was a \"half-lit Asha Parekh\" in this film. Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri praised his earlier film Shaheed and enthused Manoj Kumar to make a film on the Jai Jawaan Jai Kissan slogan. The slogan shaped into Manoj Kumar's official debut as a director for Upkar, where he believably played both a jawan and a kisan. A huge hit, Upkar made Manoj an authority on screen patriotism  According to Movie expert Rajesh Subramanian, Rajesh Khanna was originally signed for the film but before the shooting kicked off he won the All India Talent Contest organised by United Producers and Filmfare and thus had to withdraw. Prem Chopra replaced him. Film's music was given by Kalyanji Anandji.Lyrics for Upkar were penned by Qamar Jalalabadi, Indeevar, Gulshan Bawra, and Sitaram dhawan",

        "full_text": " Veer-Zaara is a 2004 Indian romantic drama film directed by Yash Chopra under the Yash Raj Films banner. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan, Preity Zinta, and Rani Mukerji in the leading roles, with Manoj Bajpayee, Kirron Kher, Divya Dutta and Anupam Kher in supporting roles. Veteran actors Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini make a special appearance in the film. The film's story and dialogues were written by Aditya Chopra. Set against the backdrop of conflict between India and Pakistan, this star-crossed romance follows the unfortunate love story of an Indian Air Force pilot, Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh and a Pakistani woman hailing from a rich political family of Lahore, Zaara Hayat Khan, who are separated for 22 years. Saamiya Siddiqui, a Pakistani lawyer, finds Veer in prison and upon listening to his story, tries to get him freed. Highly anticipated pre-release, the film eventually became the top-grossing Bollywood film of the year at both the Indian and the international box office, earning over \u20b9942.2 million (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide, in addition to being showcased at numerous prominent film festivals around the world. The music of the film, based on old compositions by Madan Mohan with lyrics by Javed Akhtar, was also successful. Upon its theatrical release, Veer-Zaara received mostly positive reviews from critics & called as Romantic film of year 2004. The film won several awards in major Indian film award ceremonies, including the Most Popular Film award at the National Film Awards and the Filmfare Award for Best Film, among others. The performances of the lead cast were highly praised, especially those of Shah Rukh Khan and Rani Mukerji.   Most of the story is revealed as a flashback to 1982 from the prison cell of Veer Pratap Singh. The narrative begins by showing Zaara Haayat Khan (Preity Zinta), an independent, carefree, and sprightly young Pakistani girl travelling to India. Her family is of a political background and a well known family of Lahore. She is on her way to India with the ashes of her Sikh governess Bebe (a Punjabi word to denote mother or grandmother, but here used for Zaara's old governess). Before dying, Bebe (Zohra Sehgal) begs Zaara to fulfill her final wish - to take her ashes to India, to the holy Sikh city of Kiratpur, and scatter them in the Sutlej river, among her ancestors. Zaara decides to carry out Bebe's dying wish. Upon reaching India, Zaara's bus has an accident causing it to overturn. An Indian Air Force pilot, Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh (Shah Rukh Khan) comes to her rescue and with his help, Zaara completes Bebe's final rites. Veer convinces Zaara to return with him to his village to spend one day together. Zaara agrees and Veer takes her on a tour of India. They visit Veer's home village on the day of the Lohri festival and meet Veer's uncle Choudhary Sumer Singh (Amitabh Bachchan) and aunt Saraswati Kaur (Hema Malini). With his uncle telling Veer that, in a dream he has seen Zaara becoming Veer's wife, Veer realises he is falling in love with Zaara. Taking her to catch her train to Lahore, Veer is just waiting for the right time to tell Zaara about his feelings, but before he can do that they are met by Zaara's fiance, who has come looking for her, Raza Sharazi (Manoj Bajpayee). Just before she boards the train, Veer confesses his love to Zaara. He gets no sense of Zaara's feelings, but as she is leaving he discovers he still has one of her silver anklets. She nods for him to keep it; both believe that this is the end of the road for their relationship and that they will probably never meet again. On reaching Pakistan, Zaara realises that she is having deep feelings of love for Veer, but that it is her duty to keep her family's honour and marry her fianc\u00e9, a wedding that will further her father's political career. She initially tells her mother of an Indian man who is ready to give his life for her and for whom she has fallen for. But her mother becomes angry at hearing it. Soon Zaara starts to see Veer everywhere and finally tells Shabbo (Divya Dutta), her maid and friend, that she has fallen in love with him. Shabbo calls Veer and tells him how miserable Zaara is without him. She asks him to come and take Zaara away. Veer who had told Zaara that he would give up his life for her, quits the Indian Air Force and goes to Pakistan to bring her back with him to India. Zaara's mother, Mariam Hayaat Khan (Kirron Kher), however, begs him to leave Zaara as Zaara's father, Jahangir Hayaat Khan (Boman Irani) is a high-profile politician whose reputation, and health, will be ruined if news gets out that his daughter is in love with an Indian. Veer respects this request and decides to leave for India but Raza, who is outraged by the shame Zaara has brought upon him, frames Veer and has him wrongly imprisoned on charges of being an Indian spy. The story moves forward to 2004 and Veer now meets Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani Mukerji), who is an idealistic Pakistani lawyer, whose mission in life is to pave the path for women's empowerment in Pakistan. The Pakistani government has decided to review the cases of some Indians, but stacking the deck against Siddiqui winning her first case, she has been given the case of prisoner 786 (Veer). Many view it as an impossible task as the man has been languishing in prison and has not spoken to anyone for the last 22 years. Also, the prosecution is led by Zakir Ahmed (Anupam Kher), her ex-boss who has never lost a case. Veer opens up to Saamiya and tells her that she can fight his case but cannot mention, much less subpoena, Zaara's family. The number 786 is considered by some Muslims to be a holy number in Islam; this convinces Saamiya that God has chosen Veer for some special purpose, and she becomes even more determined to exonerate him, restore his name and identity, and return him to his country. After the prosecution presents it case, Saamiya realises she must cross the border and find someone in Veer's village who can prove Veer's true identity. There, Saamiya meets Zaara and Shabbo, who had fled to India and have taken over running the girls' school after the deaths of Veer's uncle and aunt. She had thought that Veer died on his bus that ran off a cliff, killing everyone on its way to India. Saamiya takes Zaara back to Pakistan to tell the court the truth about Veer's identity. The judge releases Veer from prison and apologises on behalf of Pakistan. After Veer is finally released, he and Zaara say goodbye to Saamiya and Pakistan at the Wagah border crossing, returning to their village together. The story states two lovers always find their way no matter how difficult it is and destiny will always put you together. The soundtrack of Veer-Zaara was released on CD, LP record and specially on Audio DVD. The music is based on old and untouched compositions by the late Madan Mohan, as revised by his son Sanjeev Kohli. Yash Raj Music also released complete background music of Veer-Zaara, this being a rarity. The CD was titled The Love Legend Themes - Instrumental. The famous playback singer Lata Mangeshkar sang most of the songs. She used to sing with Madan Mohan, so there was a special poignancy to her contributions. According to Yash Chopra, upon coming for the recording, with tears in her eyes, Lata Mangeshkar told him, \"Madan Mohan was like my brother. You [Chopra] are like my brother. I feel I have gone back in past\". Other singers like Jagjit Singh, Udit Narayan, Sonu Nigam, Gurdas Mann, Roop Kumar Rathod, Ahmed Hussain, Mohammad Hussain and Pritha Mazumder also appear in the soundtrack.The lyrics were penned by Javed Akhtar, getting nominated for \"Aisa Des Hai Mera\" and \"Tere Liye\", won his 8th Filmfare Award for the latter. The album was the best selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year. The album was nominated for Filmfare Best Music Director but lost to Main Hoon Na, although it managed to win IIFA Award for Best Music Director. Veer-Zaara opened in theatres on 12 November 2004. It grossed over \u20b9942.2 million (US$15\u00a0million) worldwide. The film collected \u20b9580 million (US$9.0\u00a0million) in India, becoming An All Time Blockbuster of the year. In its first week it grossed \u20b9170 million (US$2.6\u00a0million), an opening week record which was held until 2005. The film was a success not only in India and Pakistan, but also overseas, notably in United Kingdom, Germany, France, South Africa, Canada and the United States. It earned \u20b9357.5 million (US$5.5\u00a0million) in the overseas markets, making it 2004's top-grossing Bollywood production overseas and was declared an all time blockbuster. When the three leading actors of the film, Khan, Zinta and Mukerji, visited the Virgin Megastore in the UK, over 5,000 fans thronged the store. Apart from that, it was screened at the Berlin Film Festival, where it was received well. In February 2005, it was featured in the issue of the National Geographic Magazine in an article about Bollywood. On 26 April 2006, Veer-Zaara had its French premiere at The Grand Rex, the biggest theatre in Paris. It is the first Hindi film to premiere in such a large and luxe venue. In September 2007, a book based on the making of the film, titled They said it, was released. The book contains testimonials from members of the film\u2019s cast and crew and follows the production stages of the film. Aakash Gandhi of Planet Bollywood gave the film a 9/10 rating and said, \"Love stories come and go, films become hits and flops; but eternal love stories and immortal films are what stay alive in the hearts of movie lovers. Veer-Zaara is the majestic tale of two people, whose love for one another crosses into the realm of inspirational devotion. Veer and Zaara\u2026two names detached by the wraths of religion\u2026two entities divided by military and national borders\u2026two forms estranged by miles of expansive distance\u2026one soul joined by sacrificial love\u2026one existence\u2026Veer-Zaara. S.Mahapatra of smashits.com observed, \"This emotional love story is not only a serious entertainer but also one which contains a message for the public...a message to strengthen the bond of love between India and Pakistan.\" Subhash K. Jha of glamsham.com stated, \"\"Veer-Zaara\" is a very simple story of immense nobility and idealism. Its contours are fleshed out with the most precious colours of life to complete a picture that is at once symmetrical and sublime, sweet, tender and yet secreting a core of strength and conviction that takes it beyond the conventional romantic musicals.\" The film was also acclaimed overseas. Manish Gajjar of BBC commented, \"Veer Zaara has a great storyline with some unpredictable twists and emotions, keeping you engrossed throughout.\" BBC guest reviewer Jay Mamtora said, \"Veer Zaara is an intense, emotionally charged, mature love story that never loses focus.\" He remarked, \"...it's a very sensible and mature film that has the makings of a classic regardless of its fate at the box office.\" Derek Elley of Variety wrote, \"Though it doesn't quite match recent classics like \"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...\" in sheer technique and production sheen, in-depth star casting and thorough entertainment values make this a must-see for Bollywatchers. LilAni of bollywhat.com stated, \"Veer-Zaara evades description; the viewer must simply experience it for herself [sic]. To watch it is to fall in love with the characters. You will emerge from the theatre feeling like you have just immersed yourself in a different, more magical world.\" Avijit Ghosh wrote in The Telegraph, \"In a year that has celebrated lust with such candour and abandon, Yash Chopra's latest work brings you back to the secure arms of love. A Pakistani girl, Zaara Hayat Khan's (Preity Zinta) chance meeting with an Indian Air Force officer Veer Pratap Singh (Shah Rukh Khan) develops into a tale of ardour that has the grand passion of a modern-day Laila-Majnu. The film works because the stars shine. Preity's Zaara is both restrained and dignified. This is her most nuanced performance to date. And Aditya Chopra's wonderful screenplay etches out even the smaller parts in loving detail. Divya Dutta's Shabbo, Zaara's playmate, is as memorable as Mughal-e-Azam's Suraiyya (the character, not the heroine.)...In all, we have an honest-to-the-heart film that remarkably bypasses the bitterness of Indo-Pak relations in a cross-border love story and reaches out as much to the McDonald-multiplex couple as the babuji-bahenji pair. Veer-Zaara is for all seasons and every reason.\" Winner On 6 June 2005 Yash Raj Films released the DVD of Veer-Zaara on a Collector's Double DVD Pack, with disc one containing the original film and disc two having special features, e.g. making of the songs (with little original melodies), interview with Yash Chopra, premier, deleted scenes, trailers and promo and deleted song \"Yeh Hum Aa Gaye Hain Kahan\". Disc 1 (the film) has one audio track in Hindi, and eleven subtitle tracks in English or Arabic. The film was released on Blu-ray in December 2009 and was 196 minutes long, unlike the theatrical version which is 192 minutes long as the Blu-ray includes the deleted song mentioned above during the first day at court scene.",

        "full_text": " Vicky Donor is a 2012 Indian romantic comedy directed by Shoojit Sircar and produced by actor John Abraham. It stars Ayushmann Khurrana, Yami Gautam and Annu Kapoor in the lead roles. It released on 20 April 2012 in around 750 screens across India and received positive response worldwide. Vicky Donor opened to critical acclaim and performed strongly at the box office. The storyline is based on sperm donation and infertility. The story is loosely based on the Canadian French film Starbuck. The film won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment at the 60th National Film Awards. The film is being remade in Telugu as Naruda Donoruda starring Sumanth and Pallavi Subhash.[citation needed]   Dr. Baldev Chaddha (Annu Kapoor) is a fertility expert who runs a clinic and a sperm bank in Daryaganj, Delhi that guarantees high-quality and specialised sperm for couples. Unfortunately, he has more failed cases to his credit than successes. A healthy and high-performing donor is needed. While searching for his 'Indian Alexander', Chaddha bumps into Vicky Arora (Ayushmann Khurrana). Vicky is the only son of his widowed mother Dolly (Dolly Ahluwalia), who runs a small parlour from their home in Lajpat Nagar. He lives with his mother and grandmother and provides no financial support to them. Dolly is always nagging at Vicky to go and work for his uncle (Inderpal Singh) so he can help with the family's finances. But Vicky wants a job in a multinational company, which will provide him with a better lifestyle. Vicky's neighbor Shweta (Puja Gupta) is infatuated with him, but Vicky doesn't reciprocate which causes friction between the two. A small brawl in the colony brings Chaddha and Vicky face to face; Chaddha concludes that Vicky could be the donor he has been looking for. From here on, Chaddha's days and nights are spent convincing Vicky to become a donor; he finally gives in. Although Vicky is hesitant at first, he accepts being a sperm donor after seeing the money he could make. He starts to spend money wildly and renovates his home and his mother's beauty parlor. He fulfills all his dreams with the money he is making. At first he openly discloses he is a sperm donor to his friends but, after repeatedly disgusting them, he starts to keep it a secret. Vicky falls in love with Ashuma Roy (Yami Gautam), a Bengali bank employee, whom he meets when he goes to open an account. At first Ashuma is repelled by Vicky and his attitude, but slowly becomes attracted to him. After dating, they admit they are in love and want to get married. Ashuma also discloses that she was briefly married to a Bengali, who left her immediately after their wedding because he loved someone else. When she asks Vicky about his status, he hides the fact he is a sperm donor feeling ashamed of it. Despite initial friction between Vicky's and Ashuma's families due to conflicting cultures, they convince their families and get married. After their wedding Vicky stops donating sperm out of faithfulness to Ashuma. It is discovered that Ashuma is infertile and Vicky, with a heavy heart, takes better care of her. One day while looking at the doctor's reports, Ashuma cannot find Vicky's reports and asks him where they are. He admits to not having taken the fertility tests, because of his past as a sperm donor. Ashuma becomes extremely upset as her husband has multiple children while she is unable to bear any herself. She is also upset that he lied to her. Ashuma goes back to Kolkata to her father's home. Vicky is very upset as he loves Ashuma a lot and cannot live without her. One night he gets a frantic call from his mother who claims that income tax agents have raided her beauty parlor. Vicky rushes to her aid. Once there he is arrested on suspicion of handling black money. While at the police station, Vicky is bailed out by Dr. Chaddha and he clear the air with the police about Vicky's money. He explains that he is a sperm donor and the money was from the parents who used Vicky's sperm. After being released by the police, Dr. Chaddha and Vicky have a chat. Vicky explains that Ashuma has left because of his work as a sperm donor and that she is infertile. Dr. Chaddha tells him that he will fix his marriage. He asks Vicky to bring Ashuma to a guest house where he will host an event. Vicky is reluctant because he is not sure if Ashuma will be willing to come with him. After Vicky has a chat with Dr. Chaddha he goes to his mother home. She is very upset with him and slaps him. She is angry with him about the sperm donation. While his grandmother is also clearly upset, she points out that Vicky brought happiness and joy to those parents and that's all that matters to her. She then encourages Vicky to go to Kolkata and bring back Ashuma, which he does. Vicky then goes to Ashuma's father's home and tries to apologize for his deception. Although she is reluctant, Ashuma's father sets her straight and tells her that Vicky is a good person, and she should not leave him because she is envious of his being able to have children. She agrees to go with Vicky to Dr. Chaddha's event. Dr. Chaddha called all the families who received Vicky's sperm to a 25th anniversary party for his clinic. She then sees how Vicky has brought happiness into the families' lives. Dr. Chaddha then takes Vicky and Ashuma to an orphanage. He explains that while tracking down two children who Vicky fathered, he came across one child he fathered who lost her parents in a car accident and had to be put in an orphanage. He says that Vicky and Ashuma should adopt her. They happily agree and reconcile with each other. The movie ends with Dr. Chaddha calling Vicky telling him that a request for his sperm has come in, asking if he will donate. With Ashuma's approval he agrees... Vicky Donor deals with sperm donation and infertility. When questioned about the risky subject matter, Abraham responded, \"Basically, Vicky Donor is a romantic comedy. But the concept is set against the background of sperm donation.\" Abraham hoped that the film could shed light on a serious issue still considered \"taboo\" in Indian society. Sircar said, \"I want to take a light-hearted look at the taboo attached to infertility and artificial insemination.\" Before filming began, Sircar researched the plot themes for three years. Juhi Chaturvedi, creative director at advertising agency Bates, who wrote the screenplay based on her own idea, had stayed in Lajpat Nagar as a student at College of Arts, Delhi. As the script went through several drafts, she met a couple who run a noted fertility clinic in Mumbai. Despite the usual trend, Abraham did not take up the leading role in the film: \"It was a conscious decision to not act in my first production because I believe producing a film is about creating quality content that I believe in.\" Director Sircar suggested Khurrana, a video jockey and television host, for the role of Vicky; he was considered because he was popular among the youth. He \"can read and write Punjabi too.\" Khurrana turned down three film projects to play the lead in Vicky Donor.

        "full_text": " Virasat (English: Inheritance) is a 1997 Indian Hindi film, directed by Priyadarshan. The story was adapted from the Tamil film Thevar Magan. Mushir-Riaz duo produced the film. It starred Anil Kapoor, Tabu, Amrish Puri, Pooja Batra, Milind Gunaji and Govind Namdeo. The music was composed by Anu Malik and S. P. Venkatesh, with the former composing the songs and the latter composing the score. The film marked the comeback for Priyadarshan in Hindi cinema. Music director Annu Malik reused some of the original tunes of Ilaiyaraaja from Thevar Magan.   After completing his studies in London, Shakti Thakur (Anil Kapoor) returns to his ancestral village in India. Accompanying him is his girlfriend, Anita (Pooja Batra), whom he is in love with and wants to marry, much to the disapproval of his family. After a few days, Shakti starts to feel that nothing much has changed in his hometown and longs to leave. He tells his father that he wants to sell his share of the family's property and open a chain of restaurants. His father, the zamindar Raja Thakur (Amrish Puri), urges Shakti to stay in the village and help it progress by virtue of the latter's education, saying \"A man gets an education not to become a selfish being but to uplift his uneducated brothers and society\". Shakti disagrees with his father and decides to leave. He is unable to bear the animosity amongst the townspeople, particularly between his dad, Raja Thakur (Amrish Puri), and rival Zamindar Birju (Govind Namdeo) (Shakti's crippled uncle) and his son Bali Thakur. The entire village suffers from this longstanding family feud as most of the village and its surrounding areas is divided between the brothers. Since Bali Thakur holds a grudge and always tries to one upon Raja Thakur, it puts them at loggerheads with each other. Shakti spends time in the village with his girlfriend by re-visiting his childhood memories including a game of sticks with Bali Thakur men which he wins. They come across an old temple which has been closed off on Bali Thakur\u2019s instructions. He insists on entering and his friend and servant Sukhiya breaks open the lock for them to look around. Bali Thakur hears of this and a brutal riot is started among the two village factions. Raja Thakur, in order to quell the situation, contemplates on apologising to his opponents. Shakti feels it should be him or Sukhiya who should apologise. When Shakti asks for Sukhiya, he learns that Bali Thakur's men have cut off Sukhiya\u2019s hand as punishment for opening the temple and Raja Thakur's men burn down the homes of Bali Thakur villagers in retaliation. To prevent a further escalation of the situation Shakti, with permission from his father, enlists the help of his friend in the government and opens the temple for all legally. Slighted by this, Bali Thakur hires goons to break a dam protecting a part of the village faction that supports Raja Thakur. Although a female villager spots one of the goons near the dam, she does not think much of it. The dam is damaged by explosives used by the goons which results in flooding of half the village. This results in numerous deaths including infants which deeply saddens Shakti. He spots the goon who placed the explosives again in the village and gives chase. After capturing, he hands the goon over to the police but the goon does not speak of Bali Thakur's involvement due to fear for his own family's safety. Later Bali Thakur intimidates a villager living in Raja Thakur's area to close a portion of his land, preventing the public from reaching the main road easily. Shakti and his father invite them for talks at village Panchayat to resolve the standoff due the riots and flooding. In the village panchayat, accusations fly from both sides. With no evidence backing up the truth, Bali Thakur accuses Raja Thakur for orchestrating various attacks on his brother's family and insults him relentlessly. Disrespected and heart broken, Raja Thakur returns to his home and passes away due to a heart attack later that night. Shakti takes over his father\u2019s duties as the head of the village. As time passes, this incident dies down. The villagers express concern to Shakti about going around the piece of land that has been closed off and causes a much longer travelling time. Shakti reasons with the owner of the land to open it up for all villagers to pass so that their long commute is shortened. Although understanding and willing, the land owner, is afraid of Bali Thakur\u2019s backlash especially since he has a young daughter Gehna (Tabu). Shakti assuages his fear by arranging marriage between a well-to-do person from his village to the land owner's daughter. Everybody involved happily agrees and the land owner opens up the land for everyone. On the day of the wedding, the groom runs away, fearing Bali Thakur. The landowner and his daughter are distraught over this claiming that it is a huge disrespect to his family. He opines that even if someone marries his daughter, they have to live in constant fear. Shakti then gets permission from the landowner and weds his daughter. Although Shakti still has feelings for his girlfriend and his new bride is very shy, they overcome their awkwardness and move on. Soon, his girlfriend returns and learns the truth. Although saddened by the turn of events, she understands the situation and leaves. Shakti, too, closes the chapter about his girlfriend and starts his new life with his wife. Bali Thakur, enraged by the opening of the land, plants a bomb during the village festival despite the pleas of his mother and own father to stop the violence. This results in deaths on both sides of the village. Both factions of the village, wanting revenge, go after Bali Thakur and his family. Shakti protects the innocent family and helps them get away from the villagers. Appreciative of Shakti's efforts to protect them Birju Thakur finally ends his enemity towards him. Shakti eventually finds Bali Thakur and asks him to surrender to the police before the villagers kill him. Bali Thakur\u2019s rabid hatred for Shakti makes him reject his offer of help. Bali Thakur, blaming Shakti for all his problems, tries to kill him. In the struggle that follows, Shakti accidentally decapitates Bali Thakur. Although other villagers are willing to take the blame for Bali Thakur's murder, Shakti gives himself up to the police to end the cycle of violence once and for all. The film depicts the true meaning of education as \"a tool to uplift uneducated people\". Virasat was nominated for nine categories at the Filmfare awards and won seven of them.

        "full_text": " Wake Up Sid is a 2009 Indian coming of age drama film. Directed by Ayan Mukerji and produced by Karan Johar's Dharma Productions, the movie was distributed by UTV Motion Pictures, with visual effects contributed by the Prime Focus Group. The film takes place in contemporary Bombay and tells the story of spoiled, careless, rich-kid Sid Mehra (Ranbir Kapoor), a college student who is taught the value of owning up to responsibility by Aisha (Konkona Sen Sharma), an aspiring writer from Calcutta. It was critically and commercially successful. Ranbir Kapoor won numerous awards for his performance, and the film's soundtrack was vastly popular.   Siddharth \"Sid\" Mehra (Ranbir Kapoor) is the carefree son of wealthy businessman Ram Mehra (Anupam Kher) and Sarita (Supriya Pathak) in Mumbai. Depicted as a spoiled slacker, Sid shows little concern for his plans after college, barely studying for tests and having no interest in working for his father. On the night after the final exams, he meets Aisha (Konkona Sen Sharma), an aspiring writer recently moved away from her hometown of Calcutta and a few years older than Sid. With the help of Sid, along with his friends Rishi (Namit Das) and Laxmi, Aisha finds a small apartment overlooking the city skyline. She also lands a job at Mumbai Beat (based on Time Out! Mumbai), a hip magazine run by editor-in-chief Kabir (Rahul Khanna), whom Aisha is attracted to. After learning that he has failed the final exams (delaying his graduation for another year), Sid displaces his frustration onto Rishi, and later gets into a heated argument with his parents, ending with him moving out. Aisha allows Sid to temporarily stay at her apartment, but finds him disorganized and careless with her home. One night, Aisha loses her temper and yells at Sid for his inability to clean up after himself. The next morning, Sid confides in Aisha that he now realizes his constant dependence on Ram's wealth, a realization that persuades him to seek work. Aisha helps him land a role as a photography intern \u2013 photography having been a hobby of his since childhood \u2013 at Mumbai Beat. The internship slowly motivates Sid to be more responsible and productive. He helps out with chores, an internal change visible to all around him. He reconciles with Rishi when they meet again for the first time since their fight. Sid eventually gets hired full-time at Mumbai Beat and receives his first paycheck. He makes amends with his parents, and Ram invites Sid to return home. Aisha and Kabir start dating, but she quickly realizes that, despite her initial attraction to him, they have very little in common. Aisha then develops feelings for Sid, and on the day he packs his belongings to move back in with his family, she is furious to hear that he is leaving. Confused and hurt, unaware that Aisha has fallen in love with him, Sid makes his departure. Back at home with Ram and Sarita, Sid receives the latest issue of Mumbai Beat. He reads Aisha's column, an article describing her adjustment to life in Mumbai and her love for an unnamed person. Realizing that it is about her feelings for him, Sid rushes through rainy weather to meet her at the same beach where they had gone the day they met. Sid expresses his love for her and the two embrace. Wake Up Sid opened well in India and overseas markets. Its opening weekend gross was \u20b9215 million (US$3.3\u00a0million) of which the domestic gross was \u20b9170 million (US$2.6\u00a0million).

Do Knot Disturb also released during the same time, but Wake Up Sid got a larger portion of the audience. Wake Up Sid was well received by a number of critics. Subhash K. Jha gave Wake Up Sid a rave review stating that it is, \"a triumph on many levels [...] Ayan Mukherjee takes the age-old dramatic conflicts of our commercial cinema into understated corridors.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film three out of five stars, stating that Wake Up Sid \"has its heart in the right place and marks the breakout of a bright, shining star who has come into his own so early in his acting career. Watch it, and be awestruck by Ranbir.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film four out of five stars as well as a \"thumbs up\" stating that it is \"strongly recommended.\" Mayank Shekhar of the Hindustan Times gave it 3.5 out of four stars and states, \"Wake Up Sid belongs to a sweet genre that, without doubt, flows on from Farhan Akhtar's Dil Chahta Hai: part Hollywood; part Bollywood; mostly coming-of-age; subtly romantic; largely original; authentic in feel; light in weight; English in expression; Hindi in language.\" Avijit Ghosh of The Times of India gave it three and half out of four stars and suggests that, \"Wake Up Sid becomes a sort of template of how GenNow navigate their lives: deal with their own little rebellions, find meaning to their own definitions of independence and handle their own set of mistakes. It feels good when the two friends finally meet in driving rain under the grey skies by the sea. Refreshing and heart-warming, Wake Up Sid really puts you in the mood for love.\" Noyon Jyoti Parasara of AOL India gave it three and half out of five stars and praised the director saying, \"Ayan Mukerji arrives in style and manages to leave his own mark on the film despite having a producer like Karan Johar whose other productions always tend to have his stamp. Wake Up Sid really puts you in the mood for love.\" Joginder Tuteja of the Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) calls the film \"flawless\" and gave it three and a half stars. He states: \"There are five things that make Wake Up Sid a delightful affair. It has a constant flow throughout; no over the top or understated drama; no ultra emotional strangulation of audiences; absolutely no yuppie cool dude act; and last but not the least, this is an original and refreshing story.\" Rachel Saltz of The New York Times argues that: \"With no big production numbers (songs play over montage sequences), a quiet style and credible characters, Wake Up Sid is Bollywood in an indie mood, a film for people like Aisha and Sid: young and educated. It may not be as hip as Bombay Beat, the magazine where the two work, but it shows that Mr. Mukherji is a director to watch.\" In one point of criticism, Sudhish Kamath of Chennai's The Hindu labeled the closing moments as a \"stock ending\" and noted that, despite the film's overall effectiveness, the ending \"leaves you a little disappointed.\" Variety's Joe Leydon found the film \"instantly forgettable\", but praised the performances of Kapoor and Sharma, as well noting how \"effortlessly appealing\" the movie is, stating: \"...this atypically low-key Bollywood romantic comedy somehow manages to remain pleasantly diverting throughout its 138-minute running time.\" On 2 October, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena supporters protested to halt the screening of Wake Up Sid in Mumbai and Pune. The MNS objected the use of the word \"Bombay\" instead of \"Mumbai\" in the movie. The movie was entirely shot in Mumbai, covering the South and Bandra Side. The college sequence was shot at H.R. College of Commerce and Economics near Churchgate. 2010: Filmfare Awards The soundtrack has music composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. The music was released on 21 August 2009. One song in the film has been composed by Amit Trivedi who scored the background music for the film. The reactions towards the music were favorable. Chandrima Pal of Rediff gave the album 3.5 stars, stating, \"the music sticks to the brief. It is hip, urban and bubbly, and unhurried. And thanks to Shankar Ehsaan Loy's musicianship, it is a slick, well-balanced production\". Joginder Tuteja (Bollywood Hungama) gave it 3 stars out of possible 5, suggesting that, \"this may not really turn out to be the best seller of the year but should certainly be a perfect fit for the narrative.\" Ayan Mukerji confirmed that the film is complete and there is no possibility of a sequel",

Though the screenplay was written by Dhruva Chatterjee, parts were later rewritten, wherein Manoj Kumar took an active role. Music by Madan Mohan was the asset of this movie. The film became a hit at the box office. Its success had Khosla directing Sadhana in two more suspense thrillers: Mera Saaya (1966) and Anita (1967 film).   On a rainy night, the highly reputed Dr. Anand is driving. He sees a woman standing in the road and gives her a lift. She introduces herself as Sandhya. As soon as she steps in the car, the wipers eerily stop working. He's even more spooked when the lady shows him the way when it isn't visible and guides him outside a cemetery. On reaching the cemetery, the gates open automatically and he hears someone sing the words \u201cNaina Barse Rimjhim Rimjhim\u201d. Dr. Anand is about to inherit a large fortune from a distant relative under the condition that he is perfectly mentally stable\u2014otherwise he would not inherit the property as there had already been cases of mental instability in his family in the past. His colleague, Dr. Lata loves Dr. Anand but he already has a girlfriend, Seema. Mystery unfolds when Seema is killed by a cyanide injection and the suspects are Dr. Lata and her father, Dr. Singh, the head doctor of the hospital in which Anand and Lata work. On a stormy night, Anand is called to a dilapidated mansion on an emergency case. There, he comes to know that the patient has already died. He is surprised to see that the patient is Sandhya. Some policemen tell him that the place has been deserted for a while and that it is rumored to be haunted. The policemen inform him that what he saw in the mansion happened years ago and many a doctor have registered similar cases with the police on rainy nights. On another occasion, he sees a newspaper which says that Sandhya died in a rail accident. Anand is very unhappy after his girlfriend\u2019s demise but his marriage is fixed to a girl Anand\u2019s mother has never even seen, but was recommended by her sister. On the wedding night, Anand is shocked to see that it's Sandhya. He starts avoiding her. One day, he sees that she has painted the same bungalow in which he was called on that rainy night. Just after that, he hears her singing a part of \u201cNaina Barse Rimjhim Rimjhim.\" Another evening, he sees an unmanned boat sailing in the lake and hears another part of \u201cNaina Barse Rimjhim Rimjhim.\" Yet another night, Sandhya reaches Anand\u2019s hospital and tries to impress him with her beauty and singing. He gets impressed and they sit in the car, where he gets d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as again the wipers stop working and she can clearly see the way in the stormy and foggy night. He takes her to the bungalow and to the room where he had seen her dead and she disappears. When he reaches home, she is waiting for him and his mother says that she never left the house. Anand is finally successful in persuading his mother to let Sandhya go back to her home by train. The next day, he comes to know that the train got into an accident, but he saw her on the terrace that same night. All these things take a toll on his mental health and he is advised to take some rest in Shimla. There, he meets a monk on a hilltop who tells him that 100 years ago at this very spot, a boy and a girl were romancing when the girl fell and died. Since then, her spirit has been roaming, waiting for her lover to return, who has been reincarnated in Anand\u2019s form. Anand then sees Sandhya far down the hillside and she sings the last part of \u201cNaina Barse Rimjhim Rimjhim\u201d. Persuaded, Anand jumps, but is saved by Lata. Later, when Anand sees Sandhya trying to lure him out, he follows her to the same old bungalow, where he sees Sandhya on the stairway in one moment and then impossibly beside him in another. She lures him to the roof, where suddenly he sees a duplicate of Sandhya. The duplicate shouts that she is the real Sandhya but she is gagged and taken away. Strengthened by this sudden revelation, Anand realizes this woman is not a ghost and confronts her, but she accidentally falls down and dies. Then comes Ramesh, Anand\u2019s cousin. He reveals that this was his plan so that Anand is termed as mentally unstable and that his entire inheritance would pass to the next cousin: Ramesh. A duel follows and the police arrive. The other woman was Sandhya\u2019s twin, of whom Sandhya didn\u2019t know, but Ramesh came to know by chance. Sandhya\u2019s parents had separated them years ago when her father took away the other girl. He died, and she was forced to adopt unfair means for her living. The \u201cSandhya\u201d who had lured him in the hospital was this other girl. This explains Sandhya\u2019s presence at 2 places at the same time. Hence, the mystery is solved and at the end of the film Sandhya and Anand hug. The music composer for this film was Madan Mohan and its famous songs were penned by lyricist Raja Mehdi Ali Khan. The music became very famous and it was also nominated for the Filmfare award that year.",

It is still remembered fondly for its soundtrack composed by music director R.D. Burman. The track, \"Chura Liya Hai\" sung by Asha Bhosle and Mohammed Rafi, is particularly well-known. It was later remade in Tamil as Naalai Namadhe, in Telugu as Annadammula Anubandham and in Malayalam as Himam.   The film uses the familiar Bollywood theme of siblings separated by fate. Gangland killers assassinate an honest man who defied them, killing his wife as well. The couple's three sons flee the massacre and lose contact with each other. They grow up in entirely different circumstances and are re-united only when one of the sons, sings the song that their mother taught them at their father's birthday at the hotel. Shankar (Dharmendra), Vijay (Vijay Arora), and Ratan (Tariq Khan) are three brothers. On their father's birthday, their mother taught them a song titled Yaadon Ki Baaraat which they held dearly to their hearts. As fate may have it, one day, the boys' father witnessed a robbery by Shakaal and his henchmen. To protect their identity, Shakaal decided to kill the boys' father before he could go to the police. So one night, he and his men storm into the boys' father's room and kill both their mother and father. Shankar and Vijay witness the act and flee. They make their way to a passing train, where Shankar is separated from Vijay. Several years pass by and the boys have grown up. Shankar is haunted by the memory of his parents' murder and is now joined by his friend Usman on a crime spree around the city. Vijay was adopted by the groundskeeper to a wealthy man, and he falls in love with the rich man's daughter Sunita (Zeenat Aman), and Ratan, was raised by the boys' maid, and changed his name to Monto. With his new identity, Monto started a band and does gigs at hotels for a living and is also in love with a co-singer (Neetu Singh). The brothers meet several times, yet do not recognize each other. However, when they finally do, they cannot contact each other. Shankar gets caught by his boss, who is the real murderer of his parents. As the movie progresses, Shankar finds out the truth and leaves Shakal to die, while his foot gets caught in the changing lines of railway tracks. Shaakal is killed by the coming train and the brothers unite. The music and soundtrack of the film was by R. D. Burman, with lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri. The opening lines of the hit song, Chura Liya Hai Tumne have slight resemblances to the English song, If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium from the soundtrack of the 1969 film of the same name. Apart from the title song, the other best remembered numbers are \"Lekar Hum Deewana Dil\" and \"Meri Soni Meri Tamanna\".",

It starred Dilip Kumar, Meena Kumari, Sohrab Modi, Nazir Hussain, Nigar Sultana and others. It was based play Yahudi Ki Ladki by Agha Hashar Kashmiri, a classic in Parsi-Urdu theatre, about persecution of Jews in the Roman Empire. Film's lyricist, Shailendra won the Filmfare Awards award for best lyricist in 6th Filmfare Awards, for the song, \"Yeh Mera Diwanapan Hai\" sung by Mukesh. The plot bears similarities to Jacques Fromental Hal\u00e9vy's opera La Juive. The story revolves around the life of a foster relationship. Set in the era of the Roman Empire over 2000 years ago, it centres around the point of persecution of Jews at the time in the empires centre - Rome.   Ezra (Sohrab Modi) is a jeweller who has a son called Elijah. He also has a friendly butler/child minder called Emmanuel. In the beginning, Ezra is due to leave. As he does, Elijah becomes upset and stands at the balcony. In the roads of the Jewish area, Brutus (Nazir Hussain), Governor of Rome, is passing, making an announcement. Watching over the balcony, is Elijah. A stone slips from his hand and hits Brutus on the head. Brutus immediately gets Elijah arrested, and as Elijah is a Jew, sentences him to death. Hearing this, Ezra rapidly returns from his trip and arrives at the doorstep of Brutus. He begs Brutus to free Elijah but Brutus feeds Elijah to hungry lions. Ezra sadly returns to his house. In revenge, Emmanuel kidnaps Lydia, motherless daughter of Brutus, and takes her to Ezra. Ezra declines to kill Lydia and adopts the child. Brutus' anger brews. He orders the guards to find his daughter, and call for punishment of all Jews. Ezra remains hidden and raises Lydia, who grows up thinking she is Ezra's daughter and that her name is Hannah. Years pass and Ezra grows to become a successful jeweler, well known to be so good and a Jew. Hannah (Meena Kumari) grows into a beautiful young lady and attracts attention from many. The Emperor of Rome arrives in Rome for the marriage of his son Prince Marcus (Dilip Kumar) to Brutus' niece Princess Octivia (Nigar Sultana). However, Prince Marcus avoids talking about his marriage and opposes it. One day, when returning from a hunting trip, he gets hurt and is cared for by Hannah. He then disguises as a Jew and goes back into the Jewish area. He saves Hannah from a Roman soldier and meets her father, Ezra, not as Prince Marcus but as Monshija, a successful Jew from Alexandria. Ezra is happy to meet him and 'Monshija' and Hannah fall in love. But Hannah soon notices that something isn't right. Prince Marcus then reveals who he is, making Hannah very upset who banishes the Prince from her life. Then comes the day of the marriage of Prince Marcus and Princess Octivia. Everyone is invited. Before the ritual could commence, Hannah shouts aloud that she had been cheated by a Roman. Ezra joins in to get back at his enemy Brutus. He clamors for justice. The Emperor demands the name of the culprit and Hannah claims it was Prince Marcus. Brutus tries to rebut Hannah and Ezra, but the Emperor insists that justice must be done. Heartbroken, Hannah returns home. She is followed by Princess Octivia. Hannah sees the Princess at her doorstep and denies her entry. Hannah knew the princess would beg for the Prince's life. However, the princess told Hannah that the Prince will be sentenced to death the very next day. Early morning the next day, without warning, Hannah took Ezra with her to the Emperor. There she told him that she takes the accusation back. She tells the Emperor that the man that cheated was not the prince but a look alike. Ezra is shocked, and Brutus, filled with happiness, sentences Hannah and Ezra to death. They are to be thrown into a cauldron of boiling oil that very day... in front of the Prince. Unable to bear that his love will be burnt in front of him, Prince Marcus blinds himself, then goes to the cauldron chamber. Here Ezra is begging for Hannah's life, and Hannah is trying to reason with Ezra that she'd rather die than live a life of hate. But Brutus stops at nothing and wants the two to die. Immediately Ezra tells Brutus that he knows where the Governor's lost daughter is. Brutus is confused and says that this is Ezra's revenge and accuses the Jew of lying. Ezra sarcastically agrees. But Brutus begs Ezra and Ezra will only tell on one condition. That Hannah be thrown into the cauldron as soon as Brutus finds out who his daughter is. Now Hannah is confused. Ezra tells Brutus that Hannah is Brutus' daughter and the Jew tells the guards to throw Hannah into the boiling oil. Brutus orders them to stop. Ezra looks at Hannah and dies. Hannah cries over her foster fathers dead body. Brutus tells Hannah not to cry, but Hannah does not listen. She runs away from Brutus and finds the Prince. Shocked to find him blind, Hannah lends him support and helps him as the two disappear into the distance.",

Shooting locations included Hadimba Temple, Gulaba, Banjaar, Hamta, and Naggar. Some shots were taken at 14,000 feet above sea level and the crew shot at a temperature as low as \u221210 degrees Celsius.

There was a lot of speculation as to who would play the female lead, with Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma being the choices. Eventually, Deepika Padukone was chosen in September 2011, who due of her faith in Ranbir and Ayan accepted the film without even reading the script. Aditya Roy Kapur and Kalki Koechlin were later signed on for pivotal roles. Koechlin and Kapur play Aditi and Avi, respectively. Evelyn Sharma had confirmed that she will play a ditzy character.

Ananya Bhattacharya of ZEENEWS.com said, \"'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' is no heavy or preachy business. It is meant to be enjoyed and it does its job well.

Tushar Joshi of DNA opined, \"YJHD is a well written film that should be watched for its direction, treatment and some remarkable performances.\" Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"there is enough eye-candy in Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani to see you through, but I wish the film had more meat and less dressing. I'm disappointed because there is a truckload of talent here. What rankles is what might have been.\" Raja Sen of Rediff.com noted that the film was good-looking but lacked a good story. He gave it 2 out of 5 stars.

        "full_text": " Zanjeer (English: Chains) is a 1973 Indian action film directed and produced by Prakash Mehra, starring Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Pran, Ajit and Bindu. The movie changed the trend from romantic films to action films and pioneered Amitabh's new image of a brooding but explosive person who fights back when cornered. He was now known as \"The Angry Young Man.\" The film started a new wave in Hindi Cinema. At a time, when India was suffering from corruption, low economic growth etc., and the common man was left with frustration and anger over the system, Hindi Cinema turned violent and aggressive. Reflecting the anger of the masses, Amitabh Bachchan became the new hero, who had the courage to fight against the wrong and maintaining moral values at the same time. This film also ended the struggling period for Amitabh and turned him into a rising star. Zanjeer, thus remains an important film in the history of Indian Cinema and is regarded as a classic today. The film became a \"super-hit\", collecting \u20b9 60\u00a0million at the box office.   The film opens on Diwali with the murder of young Vijay Khanna's parents, committed by a man of unknown identity with a white horse on his charm bracelet, \"zanjeer\". Because of this traumatic event, Vijay has recurring nightmares of a white stallion. Even as a child Vijay stays socially awkward and stays away from the other kids, showing the audience that he believes himself to be alone. Fast forward 20 years, and Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) is now an inspector, an honest police officer in a town where few are just. He receives complaints about a local man, Sher Khan (Pathan) (Pran), who is running gambling dens. When he calls Khan in for questioning, Khan's superiority complex chafes against Khanna's police authority, as he scolds the officer, telling him he only orders him around due to the uniform he wears. Vijay takes him up on his challenge, and meets him in street clothes to fight him. At fight's end, Sher Khan not only closes his gambling dens, but has gained respect for Vijay. He becomes an auto mechanic, and reforms his ways. Various dealings of the underworld continue unabated throughout the town, all tracing back to gang leader Teja (Ajit Khan). A mysterious caller continually phones Inspector Khanna to inform him exactly when a crime is about to take place, but hangs up before Khanna can extract any more information out of him. When a traffic accident perpetrated by gang members leaves several children dead, a witness, a street performer named Mala (Jaya Bhaduri), is bribed by Teja's men to keep quiet. When she is questioned by Vijay, he becomes enraged at her denying she knows anything, and, to sway her differently, takes her into the morgue to view the mangled bodies of the children. She has a change of heart, and comes clean, asking that the bribe be donated to an orphanage. She identifies the man behind the traffic accident. Once it is known that Mala has broken her word, Teja's men come after her. She is chased through the night, narrowly escaping across the train tracks, and coming to Inspector Khanna's house, desperate for shelter. He lets her in, allows her to stay, and the two discover that they are both orphans, and discuss the fears associated with living alone. Khanna kindly takes her to his brother and sister-in-law, and, under the sister-in-law's tutelage, Mala begins to learn how to keep house, as well as English, and other refinements. Eventually, Vijay is framed for bribery, stripped of his title and position as inspector, and jailed for 6 months on false charges, trapped by Teja. When he is released from jail, he plans to take revenge. Mala, by this time, has developed from a frightened stranger seeking his help to a romantic interest for him. She begs him, to seal their relationship, that he must stop being so vengeful. He agrees, but soon must come to terms with such a promise when he meets, in a Christian cemetery, the informant who had called him in the past when he was an inspector. The man, De Silva (Om Prakash), appears half-insane, holding onto an empty bottle. He says that on Christmas several years before, his three sons drank poisoned moonshine, and died from it. Until the killer is found, he will continue to wander with the bottle. When local criminals mocked him and called him crazy, he vowed to get back at them as he could: by phoning the inspector when a crime was about to happen. After hearing this news, Vijay becomes depressed, torn between his desire to help the grieving De Silva, and his need to keep his promise to Mala that he would not take any more revenge on the lowlifes of the town. Eventually, along with a concerted effort by Sher Khan to cheer up Vijay, Mala relents, vowing she will not try to control him, and says he must do what is right. The trail of tainted moonshine leads back to Teja and his men. Upon finally cornering the crook on Diwali, fireworks bursting overhead, Vijay also finds out that the person who murdered his parents, 20 years before, on the same night, is Teja, recognisable by the zanjeer on his wrist. Sher Khan helps him to fight Teja and his men, and take justice into their own hands, until the police arrive. When the hapless police inspector is held at gunpoint by Teja, Vijay manages to drop to retrieve a pistol from the ground, and shoots him dead, his body falling into the swimming pool. The role of the lead was first offered to many leading men of the time, including Raaj Kumar, Rajesh Khanna, Dharmendra and Dev Anand, which all of them turned down. Eventually, it went to a newcomer Amitabh Bachchan and established his career. A remake, with the same name, released on 6 September 2013. Zanjeer featuring Ram Charan Teja as Vijay, Priyanka Chopra as Mala, Sanjay Dutt as Sher Khan, Prakash Raj as Teja, Mahi Gill as Mona, Ankur Bhatia as Bosco, and Atul Kulkarni. Priyanka Chopra contracted the film for 90\u00a0million indian rupee turning her the highest paid Indian actress. The film is also simultaneously shot in Telugu titled Toofan, featuring the same cast except Srihari replaces Sanjay Dutt as Sher Khan, and Tanikella Bharani replaces Atul Kulkarni.",

        "full_text": " Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (English: You won't get this life again) is a 2011 Indian comedy-drama road film directed by Zoya Akhtar and produced by Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani of Excel Entertainment. The film features an ensemble cast including Hrithik Roshan as Arjun, Abhay Deol as Kabir and Farhan Akhtar as Imraan. It also stars Katrina Kaif as Laila, Kalki Koechlin as Natasha, and Ariadna Cabrol as Nuria along with Naseeruddin Shah making a special appearance. Made on a budget of \u20b9550 million (US$8.5\u00a0million), the film was shot in Spain, India, Egypt and the United Kingdom. The story follows three friends, Arjun, Kabir, and Imraan who have been inseparable since childhood. They set off to Spain on a bachelor trip and meet Laila, who falls in love with Arjun and helps him overcome his problem of workaholism. Kabir and his fianc\u00e9e experience significant misunderstanding in the meanwhile, which they soon overcome. As part of the trip, each friend chooses a dangerous sport for the group to partake. The music and score was composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. Initially expected to hit theatres on 27 May 2011, the release of the film was pushed back to 24 June, and once again to 15 July due to technical glitches in post-production. The film had a worldwide release in 1800 screens and was a critical and commercial success. It grossed \u20b91.53 billion (US$24\u00a0million) worldwide. After its theatrical run, the film was nominated for and won several awards in various categories, including two National Film Awards.   The film opens with Kabir (Abhay Deol) proposing to Natasha (Kalki Koechlin). Their families meet at the engagement party where Natasha learns that Kabir is planning a three-week bachelor road trip to Spain with his school friends Imran (Farhan Akhtar) and Arjun (Hrithik Roshan). Kabir explains that the three have a long-standing pact, and that during the road trip, each of them will have to pick an adventure sport which all three will try together. Initially, Arjun is reluctant to take trip as he does not want to lose his pay for missing work. It is later revealed that Arjun's former girlfriend left him due to his workaholism and his obsession with money. Imran has an additional personal agenda on the trip, to find his biological father Salman Habib (Naseeruddin Shah), an artist in Spain. They fly to Spain separately, where they plan to visit Costa Brava, Seville, and Pamplona. On the way to Costa Brava, Imran and Kabir find it annoying that Arjun works even during the trip. Imran nonchalantly throws Arjun's mobile phone out of their car while he is in the middle of an official call. This leads to a heated argument. Arjun, in a fit of rage, accuses Imran of having an affair, four years prior, with Arjun's previous girlfriend Sonali (a topic which was very sensitive both to Arjun and Imraan). After being pacified by Kabir and reaching their destination, they meet an Anglo Indian named Laila (Katrina Kaif) on a beach. Imran flirts with her and makes Arjun jealous. Kabir reveals that he has chosen deep sea diving as their first sport, and they later find that Laila is their diving instructor. Arjun, who cannot swim and is aquaphobic, receives assistance from Laila. She helps him overcome his fears and finish the sport successfully. Upon a request by Laila, they attend the La Tomatina festival with her in Bu\u00f1ol and meet Nuria (Ariadna Cabrol), who falls in love with Imraan. Meanwhile, Natasha becomes suspicious of Kabir's involvement with Laila when she sees them via webcam and crashes his bachelor party trip, much to Kabir's discomfort in front of his friends. Imran spends time with Nuria, and Arjun with Laila. After the boys leave, Laila realises she has fallen in love with Arjun and chases them on a bike, not wanting to regret their partition if they do not meet in future. She and Arjun express their feelings for each other with a passionate kiss. On the way to Seville, Kabir drops Natasha at the airport, while Arjun and Imran notice that something is wrong between them. The trio visit Seville for sky diving, Arjun's choice. During the task, Imraan is forced to confront his acrophobia and hesitates to take part. However, they complete it without any obstacles. After skydiving, the three men go to a bar and get into a fight with a stranger on whom they had tried to pull a prank. They are jailed after the fight. Salman Habib bails them out and takes them to his home. While speaking to Imraan, Salman reveals that he never wanted the responsibility of a married life with kids, while Imran's mother did, which is why he never contacted Imran. Imran, heartbroken, realises how his actions must have hurt Arjun four years back. He apologises to Arjun. Arjun, realising that Imran's apology is heartfelt, hugs him and forgives him. The trio learn of the bull run in Pamplona, which is Imran's choice\u00a0\u2014 baffling Kabir and Arjun. Imran calls up Laila, who comes along, surprising Arjun. When confronted by his friends, Kabir confesses to the other two that he is still not ready for a marriage, and that Natasha had gotten the wrong idea (of him proposing to her) on seeing the ring that he had bought for his mother as a birthday present. On the morning of the bull run, Imran suggests they make a pact to make a promise if they survive the event. Imran vows to publish his poetry (he is secretly a poet), Arjun vows to go to Morocco with Laila, and Kabir promises to tell Natasha that he does not want to marry her. As they complete the event, the friends gain a renewed sense of their relationships with each other, with others they know, and with themselves. During the credits, Imran, Kabir, Nuria and Natasha are shown attending the wedding of Arjun and Laila in Morocco. Natasha is seen with a new man, and Kabir and Natasha are still friends. Imran's poems are revealed throughout the story after each sporting event showing that he had published them. The scripting of the film, tentatively titled as Running with the Bulls, was completed in November 2009 after three months of work. Zoya and Kagti incorporated real life observations, and specially wrote the character of Imraan for her brother Farhan Akhtar. Akhtar wrote the dialogues for the film. The theme of the film was \"about three guys on the verge of making commitments in life\", according to him. They used Javed Akhtar's poetry as a voice-over because they felt the poetry adds depth to the character and lends voice to their feelings. A special poem inspired by a fan's poem was penned down for Katrina's character, after she was cast in the project. The first choice for the location of principal filming was Mexico, but was later changed to Spain since the climax features running with the bulls and Zoya wanted a country that blended history, culture and sports. The release date of the film was rescheduled thrice because the originally selected editor, Chandan Arora, fell ill and they had to redo the editing. Initially, Imran Khan and Ranbir Kapoor were supposed to play two of the three leads, but they declined because they wished to star together in their own production. Farhan Akhtar, Zoya's brother had worked with her in her debut film Luck By Chance, and was also the dialogue writer of the film, hence Zoya felt that he would know what she exactly wanted from the film. He was the first actor to be cast in the film. He defined his role as a \"fun character\" and a \"guy who for the longest time takes nothing seriously.\" Hrithik was chosen for another lead role, since he was a favourite actor of hers. After finalizing the two, she needed someone \"who could not just fit in with them visually but also bring something new to the table.\" She sought Abhay for the role, as he was her friend and had worked with her before in Reema Kagti's Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd. For the role of Laila, Zoya wanted someone with an \"accent\", who would be willing to do scuba diving, and was a half Indian and half Caucasian girl. A lot of girls were auditioned for it in New York and London. Later, in a party, she met Katrina Kaif, and chose her. Her role was reportedly described as \"a free- spirited girl, a wanderer at heart and a bohemian gypsy by nature.\" Zoya had wanted to work with Kalki ever since seeing her in Dev D and That Girl in Yellow Boots. She felt that Kalki would fit the bill for the character of Natasha, since she had \"the sense of comedy, but not over the top.\" Ariadna was chosen for the role of Nuria, since she was liked for her work in the 2009 Spanish film Eloise. The full cast of the film was confirmed by April 2010. The principal shooting of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, which began in June 2010, took place in Barcelona, Pamplona, Bu\u00f1ol, and Andalusia in Spain, the UK, Egypt and Mumbai. Cinematographer Carlos Catalan, who had worked with Zoya in Luck By Chance, wanted all three actors to appear tanned because he \"didn't want everything glossed over\" and wanted to make the film as realistic as possible. Katrina's introduction scene was shot on a nudist beach. During the filming, they requested that beach-goers stay out of the frame so that the film would not face objections from the Indian censor board. The La Tomatina festival of Bu\u00f1ol was re-created for the song \"Ik Junoon\". Almost sixteen tons of tomatoes worth \u20b910 million (US$150,000) were flown in from Portugal for the shoot. A scene involving a kiss between Hrithik and Katrina was shot even though the couple were initially reluctant to do so. The filming of the song \"Se\u00f1orita\" took place in Al\u00e1jar, a town in the province of Huelva. The crew warned the locals about the song's volume because the shooting took place at night. In the third day of shooting, the locals came dressed in costumes, and the mayor of Al\u00e1jar joined them for the shoot. The climax of the film, which features the Encierro, was shot at Pamplona. The final schedules were at Vashi and Alibag in Mumbai in December 2010. Composer trio Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy composed the soundtrack for the film, who had also collaborated with Akhtar in Rock On!! and Karthik Calling Karthik. The lyrics were written by Javed Akhtar. For the vocals of the flamenco song \"Se\u00f1orita\", the trio roped in Maria del Mar Fern\u00e1ndez, a Spanish flamenco singer, in what was her film singing debut. The song also marked the singing debut of Abhay Deol, who rendered the song along with the other two leads, Hrithik Roshan and Farhan Akhtar. The soundtrack met with positive response following its launch from critics, and garnered a significant notice in the music charts. The trailer of the film was revealed with the prints of Ready, and released online on 15 May 2011. Excel Entertainment teamed up with Aircel to make promos of the film available on mobile and Internet. The trailer got over 55 million views within 48 hours of its release. Two more promos, one for the song Ik Junoon and one for the song Senorita, were released on 27 May. The music launch and promotion event took place at Nirmal Lifestyle, Mulund, Mumbai. The promos of Khaabon Kay Parinday and Dil Dhadakne Do were released the following week. Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani visited Facebook India to promote the movie. A press conference promoting the film was held on 1 July at Chandigarh. Two dialogue promos of the movie were released on 3 July. The cast and crew embarked on a road trip from Mumbai to Delhi on 7 July via Surat, Vadodra, Ahmedabad, Udaipur, Ajmer and Jaipur that culminated with a concert at Gurgaon. It is believed that British Auto manufacturer Land Rover, which is now owned by Tata Motors, sponsored the Land Rover Discovery driven by the cast members during the trip. A premier at the 12th IIFA Awards was planned before the worldwide release, but it was not executed. The film's marketers released branded promotions with Mountain Dew, Gillette and ING Vysya Bank. The official game for Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, based on the La Tomatina festival, was released by Jump Games on 19 July 2011 and made available for all leading mobile platforms. OPIUM Eyewear launches its exclusive Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara Sunglasses and promoted the movie. Taking inspiration from the movie, a marketplace for safe adventure activities - Huntfactor Adventures was launched in Manali in 2015. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara was initially scheduled to release on 27 May, but was postponed to 24 June and further to 15 July 2011. It released in 1800 screens worldwide. A special screening of the film was shown at the residence of Shahrukh Khan on 16 July, the birthday of Katrina Kaif. The event was attended by several celebrities besides the film's cast and crew themselves. However, the Shiv Sena criticised the event as it was held three days after the 2011 Mumbai bombings. The producers of the film donated a cheque containing the collections of the film from around 10 theatres in Mumbai to the Maharashtra government as a mark of charity to the victims of the blasts. On 24 March 2012, ZNMD was screened exclusively at the Bucks New University in High Wycombe, UK. The DVD of the film was released on 30 August 2011. It is available in Dolby Digital 5.1 and Stereo formats with English and Arabic subtitles. The Blu-ray disc is also available.  The film garnered mostly positive reviews from critics. Based on nine reviews, review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 100% with an average rating of 8.1/10. Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph called Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara \"a beautifully scripted journey of catharsis\" and praised director Zoya Akhtar for being \"fearless in the way she shoots\". In his review for Hindustan Times, Mayank Shekhar praised the film as \"a game-changer for Hindi films since Dil Chahta Hai, and wrote \"What you take home are memorable, amusing moments of three truly adventurous amigos we've all grown up with. And will continue to\" giving it 4 stars. Shivesh Kumar of IndiaWeekly awarded the movie 4 stars. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3.5/5 stars, calling it a film for \"a more evolved, mature and cinema-literate audience that's geared up to embrace and support newer genres of cinema.\" Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film 3.5/5 stars and lauded its lead performances: \"If Abhay is the anchor of the group, Farhan's funster role is full of beans and Hrithik's metamorphosis from uptight, money-minded stock broker to carefree vagabond is a class act.\" S Chatterjee of NDTV, gave the film 3/5 stars and maintained that the film's philosophy is quite old and praised Zoya Akhtar's direction, stating \"Zoya Akhtar, by investing the tale with a delightful lightness of touch and dollops of gentle wit, brings a degree of freshness to bear upon the plot.\" Shaikh Ayaz of Rediff rated the film 3.5/5 stars and felt that Zoya Akhtar had put together a familiar plot but the film's fresh energy is entertaining. He wrote, \"Akhtar's invigorating characters pump in fresh energy into a film that could have been strictly mediocre\". Kaveree Bamzai of India Today, too was full of praise for Akhtar's direction and said \"By the time I finished watching Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara I was convinced that no one can make a romance as beautifully as a woman\", giving the film 4 stars. Film critic Subhash K Jha rated it 3.5/5 and quoted\u00a0: \"Zoya, God bless her aesthetics, sucks us into the beauty of the moment, not giving us any reason to believe that life's most precious truths are swathed in squalor.\" Blessy Chettiar of DNA India, noted the music of the film and Farhan Akhtar's acting as highlights of the film: \"For all this, the storywriters use heavy doses of symbolism. Deep-sea diving at Costa Brava, sky-diving in Sevilla and the San Fermin bull run in Pamplona, not to forget the Tomatina festival in Bunyol, where Arjun finally lets go. Fears are drowned, let open in the sky and finally at the mercy of raging bulls\", he wrote, giving it 3 stars. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN stated, \"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara takes the light-hearted tone of a fun, all-boys road trip through Spain to give you a deep and heartfelt message on why we should live life by seizing the moment and following our hearts.\" He also praised the performance of the cast, highlighting it as one of the main positives of the film, but points out that the film's length \"sucks some fun of out of the ride\" and gave a rating of 3.5 stars. On the contrary, Raja Sen of Rediff held that the film \"tried too hard to be cool\" and gave it 1.5/5 stars. Ryan Gilbey of The Guardian was broadly positive about the film: \"It's still playing to full houses, and you can see why. Slick it may be. But tourist board employees representing the various Spanish cities flattered in the movie are not the only ones who will come out grinning.\", though he found the movie \"stubbornly un-macho\" for a buddy film. The National reviewer Kaleem Aftab, in his 4 star review, noted \"Throwing together road trip, romcom and buddy-buddy action in a single picture may sound like an ill-conceived masala mash-up, but like any good dish, the ingredients are blended together with affection to create one of the best feel-good movies of the year.\" In India, the film was released along with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2. It opened well in the multiplexes, as the occupancy ranged from 70 to 100 percent, despite receiving average opening in the single screens except in the metro cities. The film grossed \u20b9525 million (US$8.1\u00a0million) in its opening three-day weekend, including \u20b973.9 million (US$1.1\u00a0million) its first day, and a net total of \u20b9265 million (US$4.1\u00a0million) on the third day. After ten days of worldwide run, it grossed \u20b91.08 billion (US$17\u00a0million). In 17 days, it grossed over \u20b9700 million (US$11\u00a0million) in India. With no significant competition other than Singham, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara remained No. 2 at the box office for 4 weeks after its release. It was one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of 2011 in India and internationally. The film was declared a super-hit in India and Overseas territories. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara grossed \u20b9120 million (US$1.9\u00a0million) overseas in three days, which made it the biggest opening for an Indian film in 2011. The film reached top-twenty lists in the US and UK. It grossed \u00a3896,289 in UK, $3,103,656 in USA, $387,384 in Australia and $136,380 in New Zealand. As of January 2012, the film has grossed $7.25 million overseas. The film grossed \u20b91.53 billion (US$24\u00a0million) worldwide, surpassing Hrithik's Dhoom 2 in the worldwide gross, becoming the ninth highest worldwide grosser of all time for a Bollywood film, as of October 2011. After the release of the film, PETA objected to the bull running scene in the film and sought support from fans via their Twitter page to ban the film. PETA spokesperson Poorva Joshipura spoke about the event and said \"We will now be contacting the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and Central Board of Film Certification to take action.\" The film's producer Ritesh Sidhwani, retorted by saying \"We had submitted all the papers to the Animal Welfare Board India that stated that none of the animals were injured or hurt in any way and only then, the censor board cleared the movie. We are only showing the culture of Spain.\" Spanish-American artist Charo sent a letter to Zoya Akhtar on behalf of PETA requesting her to remove all the scenes which related to the running of the bulls. Post theatrical run, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara won two awards at the 59th National Film Awards in the Best Audiography and Best Choreography categories. Noted regional ceremonies had the film winning several awards, mainly for the 'Best Film' and 'Best Director'. These included the Filmfare Awards, Stardust Awards, Zee Cine Awards, IIFA Awards, NDTV Indian of the Year Awards, Screen Awards, Apsara Film & Television Producers Guild Awards and the Asian Film Awards. Following the film's release, Zoya Akhtar expressed an idea to make a sequel of the film. Speaking about it, she said \"You never know, I might or may not make a sequel. It all depends on the right content.\" It has been reported that the characters are expected to reprise their roles in the sequel, if it is officially launched. In an interview with the Hindustan Times, Hrithik expressed an idea for the basic plot of the sequel. He said that it could be set five years after ZNMD and that the original characters would have grown older, having a reason to go on another trip. It has also been agreed upon that a proper script is required, as it is not a part of the \"commercial field\" of cinema. However, no official confirmations have been made regarding the sequel, despite requests from many viewers. After the IIFA ceremony, Farhan Akhtar commented that there was \"no necessity\" for the sequel. Later in 2013, in an interview with Hindustan Times, Zoya Akhtar expressed interest in scripting for the sequel after completing the shooting of her next film Dil Dhadakne Do released in June 2015.",

It stars Karisma Kapoor, Rekha, Manoj Bajpayee, Surekha Sikri, Rajit Kapoor, Lillete Dubey, Amrish Puri, Farida Jalal, and Shakti Kapoor. Renowned musician A.R.Rahman has scored the background music and soundtrack for the movie. Zubeidaa is the concluding chapter in a trilogy that began with Mammo (1994) and continued with Sardari Begum (1996). The film is based on the life of the ill-fated actress Zubeida Begum, who married Hanwant Singh of Jodhpur and was the mother of the film's writer. The film garnered the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi and won Karisma Kapoor a Filmfare Award for Best Actress (Critics).   Zubeidaa is the story of Riyaz's (Rajit Kapoor) search to understand his mother, who is not known to him, as he was brought up by his maternal grandmother in the absence of his mother. His mother's name was Zubeidaa (Karisma Kapoor) and she was the only daughter of a filmmaker named Suleman Seth (Amrish Puri). Zubeidaa acts in films secretly, but when her father finds out he forbids her to carry on and quickly arranges her marriage to Mehboob Alam (Vinod Sharawat). Things seem happy for her when she gives birth to Riyaz. However, a disagreement arises between Suleman and Mehboob's father, and Mehboob divorces Zubeidaa few days after she gives birth. Heartbroken Zubeidaa then meets Maharaja Vijayendra Singh of Fatehpur (Manoj Bajpayee). Vijayendra is already married to Maharani Mandira Devi (Rekha) and is the father of two children. Nevertheless, he falls in love with Zubeidaa and they get married, but there is continuous turmoil in their relationship. Riyaz learns through Zubeidaa's journal that though she loved Vijayendra dearly, she was unable to follow the stifling customs of the palace. She was also uncomfortable because of her brother-in-law Uday Singh's sexual advances towards her, and his demands of her to have an extra-marital affair with him. Riyaz travels to Fatehpur and asks many people about his mother. However, all except Mandira, whom Zubeidaa called \"Mandy Didi\", either deny that his mother ever existed, or say that she was a horrible woman who seduced their king and caused his death in a plane crash. On reading the journal, Riyaz finds out that Vijayendra had become a politician, and was about to go to Delhi for an important meeting. Zubeidaa felt frustrated that whenever her husband needed help he looked to Mandira for support, and at the last minute she insisted that only she will accompany him for the meeting. The plane crashes, killing Zubeidaa and Vijayendra. It is indicated that Uday Singh probably had the plane sabotaged to kill Vijayendra and Mandira so that he could get both - Zubeidaa and the kingdom. In the end, Riyaz gets the missing tape of his mother's only film, from Mandira. The movie ends with he finally getting to watch the film with his grandmother shedding tears of happiness, watching Zubeidaa dancing happily as the spirited soul that she truly was. The soundtrack was released in 2000 and contained eight tracks, all composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. Lata Mangeshkar collaborated with the musician again for couple of tracks. Other singers, Kavita Krishnamurthy and Alka Yagnik walked away with all accolades for their renditions in their respective tracks.  The jewelry worn by Karisma Kapoor and Rekha in the film actually belonged to the Jaipur royal family. Both actresses were told to be very careful when wearing it.",
